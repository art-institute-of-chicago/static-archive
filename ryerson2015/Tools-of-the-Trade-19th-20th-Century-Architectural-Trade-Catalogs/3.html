        <p>Architecture, unlike any other art, is a marriage of aesthetic and technical considerations where the limits imposed by the latter circumscribe the expression of the former. As the engineer Pier Luigi Nervi once wrote, &ldquo;Good technology seems to be a necessary though not sufficient condition for good architecture.&rdquo;<sup><a href="3.html#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Architecture and science have had strong links to one another, through the Vitruvian tradition, from the Renaissance to the mid-18th century. With the arrival of the Second Industrial Revolution (roughly 1860-1914) came the tools necessary to build the city as we know it today: electricity, steel, and the production line. Mass-production demanded standardization, which in turn increased occupational specialization. As former trades professionalized, the divergence between architecture and engineering accelerated. Despite this disparity, the complexity of modern construction, coupled with the breathtaking pace of industrial innovation in the 20th century has necessitated technical knowledge on the part of both architects and engineers.</p>
<p>These brochures, which represent a broad sampling of technical developments (and missteps) from the 20th century, illustrate not only changes in technology but also the broader context—social, economic, cultural—within which they took place.</p>

Ancient Greeks and Romans referred to the material as &ldquo;the magic mineral&rdquo; due to its fire- and acid-resistant properties, and its high strength to weight ratio. During the industrial revolution it was resurrected as insulation for boilers, steam pipes, turbines, ovens and kilns, and later as cloth for theater curtains, a base for filter material, in brake linings, and as fireproof cement and putty. Virtually inert, asbestos was also relatively inexpensive, and easily manipulated or even decorated.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs the use of asbestos spread rapidly in the 20th century, so did warnings of its ill effects. Asbestosis, a chronic lung disease, was first identified in 1927 by W.E Cooke, who noted the &ldquo;curious bodies&rdquo; (i.e., asbestos fibers) associated with it. The first comprehensive study of the health effects was conducted between 1928 and 1930, followed by the first asbestos regulations, which came into force in the UK in 1933. However, it was not until a 1960 paper on mesothelioma was published that the hazards behind asbestos exposure became broadly accepted by the medical community. In May of 1972 an American asbestos worker named Claude J. Tomplait won the first lawsuit in the U.S. against an asbestos manufacturer, which soon brought tens of thousands of similar claims. Its use in an &ldquo;unprotected or unconfined state&rdquo; was banned in the U.S. in 1973, though it remained in use in other countries for many years afterward.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/thumbnails\/Rsrc_TN_003505.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"278.2666015625","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Tools of the Trade: 19th- and 20th-Century Architectural Trade Catalogs,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, August 4, 2015-October 12, 2015.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/cdm\/ref\/collection\/mqc\/id\/68792\&quot;.html">Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture"},"resource_3506":{"resource_link":"\/aic\/collections\/exhibitions\/Ryerson-2015\/resource\/3506","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_003506.jpg","resource_title":"02. \"Just the Touch of a Finger...\" The Majestic Company; Huntington, IN; c.1925.","resource_description":"Originally called &ldquo;motor houses&rdquo; or &ldquo;automobile houses,&rdquo; the earliest motor car garages\u2014built as soon as automobiles were available for sale in the late 19th century\u2014were modeled on coach and wagon house designs that had evolved over centuries.

But other than the skeleton itself, perhaps no other invention was more critical to the evolution of the skyscraper than this: the modern elevator.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPrecursors to the elevator\u2014the lift and the hoist\u2014had long been in existence, but were slow, technically inefficient and considered generally unsafe. Elisha G. Otis was working in a bed-feather factory in upstate New York in 1851 when he struck upon the idea to design a safety brake which would engage automatically in the event of an accident. This effectively transformed the freight lift into a passenger lift. Two more innovations were needed before the modern elevator was complete: the electric motor (which was small, light and portable in comparison to the steam engine) and the invention of the friction-driven hoist in 1877 by mining engineer Friedrich Koepe. With this new combination of efficiency and safety, vertical travel was no longer an impediment to tall building construction.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/thumbnails\/Rsrc_TN_003514.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"175.8681640625","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Tools of the Trade: 19th- and 20th-Century Architectural Trade Catalogs,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, August 4, 2015-October 12, 2015.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/cdm\/ref\/collection\/mqc\/id\/68818\&quot;.html">Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture"},"resource_3515":{"resource_link":"\/aic\/collections\/exhibitions\/Ryerson-2015\/resource\/3515","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_003515.jpg","resource_title":"11. \"The City Unburnable.\" The National Fireproofing Company; Pittsburgh, PA; 1906.","resource_description":"In the 19th century the U.S. averaged one conflagration\u2014a fire causing more than $1 million worth of property damage\u2014per year. Large fires in the early 20th century destroyed large portions of Rochester, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; and (in 1906, the year this brochure was printed) San Francisco, California. By the end of the 20th century, such an event was nearly unthinkable. Though improvements in fire-fighting services no doubt contributed to this sea change, advancements in building technology catalyzed this shift. Key components of non-combustible buildings included the use of fire-resistant materials (e.g. steel and concrete) both inside and out, and the &ldquo;compartmentation&rdquo; of interior spaces. Despite the fact that the basic technology of fireproof construction was well-known by the 1880s, it would take many decades and a government mandate to bring the number of fire-resistant structures to a critical mass.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/thumbnails\/Rsrc_TN_003515.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"301.087890625","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Tools of the Trade: 19th- and 20th-Century Architectural Trade Catalogs,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, August 4, 2015-October 12, 2015.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/cdm\/ref\/collection\/mqc\/id\/68828\&quot;.html">Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture"}};
