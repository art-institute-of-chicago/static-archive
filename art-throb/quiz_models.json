The fling thing isn't for the cynic though; it's for the person who's kind of doing fine flying solo. Just be sure to communicate up front what your intentions are and pick up your own dirty socks!

Your schnookums is a superficial charmer and may be asking for more than they are willing to give. Creating a joint checking account and moving into together after the first month may seem like good ideas when you&rsquo;re under the spell of the Psycho, but not if you appreciate other joys in life, like friends and financial solvency.
