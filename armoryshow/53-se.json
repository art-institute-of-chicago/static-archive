The three works by Vlaminck included in the Armory Show in Chicago were among those lent by important Cubist art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. <em>Village</em> was installed in the Cubist gallery, next to paintings by Francis Picabia, who was characterized by the Chicago press as one of the most radical artists in the show.",
