        "description" : "Though Paul Gauguin died ten years before the Armory Show, his work was still considered radical by his critics. In his review of the exhibition, Kenyon Cox referred to Gauguin as \"a decorator tainted with insanity.\" Gauguin’s avant-garde aesthetics are evident in <em>Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape</em>, in which each figure’s form is reduced to areas of pure color defined by thick outlines. Gauguin’s use of strong contours and bright hues would be adopted by many artists of the following generation, particularly the Fauves. Many critics of the Armory Show remarked on the stylistic similarities between Gauguin and one of the most notorious artists at the exhibition, Henri Matisse. ",
