Pablo Picasso visited the artist there and they spent their time together painting landscapes; <em>Forest at Martiques</em> likely dates to during or soon after this period of collaboration. Organizers of the Chicago presentation of the Armory Show emphasized the connection between these two artists by hanging this painting beside Picasso's watercolor <em>Two Trees</em> (1907–08, The Philadephia Museum of Art), with which it shares a subject matter and palette. Like many of the works presented at the Chicago exhibition, Derain's canvas was purchased by Eddy, who would describe the artist's incorporation of Cubist aesthetics as \"both impressive and beautiful.\"",
