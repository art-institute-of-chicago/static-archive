      "description" : 'Man Ray made this socially and formally daring photograph in New York, as part of a series that positively radiates eroticism and gender ambiguity. Social norms (a well-educated young lady should not smoke) and stable sexuality (a woman flaunting a phallic symbol) are defiantly turned on their head. In a portrait of Dada coconspirators Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Stella, Man Ray taped this photograph to the wall above the sitters’ (upright) heads—a surrogate of his own presence in the picture. He also affixed the work to a group canvas, <em>The Cacodylic Eye</em>, initiated by fellow Dadaist Francis Picabia, using the photograph in place of his signature. This print and frame, meanwhile, were exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926, in a legendary survey of contemporary art mounted by the Société Anonyme.',

Gertrud Arndt came to the Bauhaus in 1923 to study architecture, but like the majority of women who enrolled, she was pushed into the textile department, from which she graduated in 1927. She experimented with photography in her spare time and in 1929 received training from Bauhaus photography instructor Walter Peterhans. Cobbling together accessories and fabric into makeshift costumes, she produced a series of 43 staged self-portraits called <em>Masked Portraits</em>. These photographs sketch out a range of female roles and moods: an Asian woman, a grieving widow, a naive young girl, a proper lady, and, in this case, a bewildered vamp.",

In 1943–44 Zykmund led a series of Sprees (řádění) in his own and friends’ apartments in Brno, the second major city in the country. Improvising based on loosely drafted scripts, Zykmund and his companions staged cultlike scenes with sundry objects as props, scribbled runic inscriptions on one another’s bodies, or enacted mysterious still lifes. The end product of these photographed performances was to have been collaborative artists’ books, of which only rare maquettes survive.",

The weekly magazine, founded to popularize news and images from a working-class viewpoint, served from the first as a major organ of opposition to the rising National Socialist party. When Hitler took power in early 1933, Heartfield and the <em>AIZ</em> editorial office fled to Prague; many of Hartfield’s best-known covers for the magazine were made in the Czech capital. Among them is this iconic picture of the monumental fist that contains a multitude of arms raised in solidarity. The composition, exceptional for Heartfield in that it shows a picture of inspiration rather than an acerbic critique, was undoubtedly influenced by the Soviet photomontages of Gustav Klutsis (one example also on view).",

      "description" : "Hans Bellmer studied art and worked in advertising in the 1920s; when the Nazis seized power in 1933, he renounced useful employment as a kind of protest. Because of his background in commercial design, Bellmer was comfortable with procedures of studio photography, which he employed in his doll series, begun that same year: posing of the model, lighting, use of props, and extensive manual interventions (coloring, retouching, overpainting) on the final prints. The doll pictures do violence to a girlish body that seems nearly alive and somehow more real in feeling than the erotic magazine images manipulated by Bellmer’s contemporaries in the Surrealist movement. He made only a few prints at this remarkably large size, hand-coloring them and mounting them to stretchers as if they were paintings; quite improbably, some of these works were exhibited during World War II, when Bellmer lived in exile in southern France.<br/><br/>From January 22&ndash;April 12, 2015 this work will be replaced by:<br/><a href='http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/205244?search_no=37&index=0' target='_blank'>Storyville Portrait</a><br/><a href='http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/199136?search_no=1&index=0' target='_blank'>Ladislav Sutnar china (with black rim)</a><br /><a href='http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/218591?search_no=43&index=0' target='_blank'>Ern&ouml; Weisz, 23-year-old Factory Worker, Budapest</a>",

Through double exposure, the artist blended his likeness with images of drafting tools and graph paper—juxtaposing mechanical instruments with his own more “primitive” tool, the hand. In its day <em>Constructor</em> symbolized a fundamental redefinition of the artist as someone who does not create, but builds, and thereby spurs the transformation of society. Yet Lissitzky seemed to acknowledge that the artist-engineer deploys commercial or industrial technology (including the camera apparatus) over which he can at best have partial control; indeed, in the negative image, he appears as the ghost in the machine.",

On the inside flap and back cover, they included the notice, “prière de toucher,” or “please touch.” Mounted on irregular swatches of black velvet, the single breasts stared out at readers like open eyes. Beyond the gesture’s humor, the silky black fabric and squishy pink breast promised tactile rewards for visitors to the exhibition. Touch is not necessarily one-way, for contact implies exchange, whether threatening, erotic, or contagious. Touch can disrupt the ordinary relations of seeing and being seen; it can challenge one to live up to the full and dangerous promise of beholding art.',

      "description" : 'Brassaï possessed an “infatuation with outcasts,” as he phrased it, that led him to photograph the nocturnal Parisian underworld; he published these images as the book <em>Paris by Night</em> in 1933. Brassaï also made pictures in the light of day. He might have taken this photograph while vacationing in the coastal French town Loctudy. In a 1931 letter to his parents, he mentions spending time with a woman named Jeannine, who could be the subject seen here. The woman’s contorted body, awkwardly mimicking the movement of a swimmer, is rendered as a sculptural figure—one that recalls the studio contortions in <em>Satyric Dancer</em>, a now celebrated image by Brassaï’s friend and rival, fellow Hungarian émigré photographer André Kertész (shown in two versions).',

      "description" : 'After George Eastman introduced the handheld Kodak #1 camera in 1888, amateurs made millions of snapshots depicting friends and family, travels, and festive occasions such as weddings. Even while solidifying such thoroughly conventional behaviors, amateur photography developed a new pictorial language that privileged immediacy, spontaneity, and accident. Career photographers and art historians—but also antiques vendors and flea-market shoppers—have long recognized the value of the “snapshot aesthetic.” The rise of social media and smartphones in recent years has effectively ended the era of the snapshot as both a printed photograph and an image for a private audience.',

      "description" : 'Physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey’s lifelong fascination with bodily movement led him to develop what he called “chronophotography”—meaning “photography of time”—a process that may have influenced the locomotion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, which are generally better known. To create his chronophotographs, Marey modified an ordinary camera by placing a rotating metal disk with multiple slots cut at regular intervals behind the lens and leaving the lens open. As the subject moved in front of a dark background, the disk acted as a shutter, exposing a sequence of images on a single photographic plate. As a member of the Académie Nationale de Médicine, Marey likely made this view of a bicyclist as part of a campaign to develop sports attire that would maximize comfort and minimize fatigue. Cubist, Futurist, and Dada artists all looked to Marey’s work as they attempted to picture the interdependence of space and time formulated by Albert Einstein.',

Now the population is 65,000, and Koza is a devouring city. At night, the population grows to 100,000. Bars, cabarets, hotels, restaurants, pawnshops and souvenir shops were suddenly built in screaming colors, like sets for Western movies, and girls collected, literally in front of the gates. A screaming-color town is a sake-drinking and sex town. It smells of the gunpowder of the Vietnam War. Stacks of dollars fly in the air.”',

Working within and outside of these movements, Cahun called into question conventions of gender, sexuality, and personal identity, particularly in her photographic self-portraits, which she made privately starting around 1913. Employing provocative disguises and makeshift backdrops, Cahun presented an evolving persona that ranged from masculine and feminine to androgynous. Although the self-portraits have become her best-known works, Cahun rarely showed them publicly during her lifetime. She was instead recognized for her undertakings in literature, sculpture, theater, and politics, all critical to her ongoing self-construction.",

He became known for an ability to capture moments at which, as he said, “something changes into something else.” Kertész photographed dancer Magda Förster in the studio of sculptor István Beöthy—two fellow émigrés from Hungary—at a time when all three were embracing forms of abstraction. Beöthy’s twisting sculptures resonated with Förster, whose bodily contortions also suggest the Charleston, a popular dance at the time. Kertész later recalled, “I said to her, ‘Do something with the spirit of the studio corner,’ and she started to move on the sofa. I took only two photographs.” Both are on view.',

      "description" : 'A defining figure of photographic modernism, Henri Cartier-Bresson used a handheld camera to snatch beguiling images from fleeting moments of everyday life. In his 1952 book, <em>The Decisive Moment</em>, he explained, “I prowled the streets all day, feeling very strung-up and ready to pounce, determined to ‘trap’ life—to preserve life in the act of living.” Cartier-Bresson was connected to Surrealist circles in Paris in the 1930s, and his early photographs reinvent street life as Surrealist theater—more surprising and mysterious than the world we know. In Córdoba, Spain, he chanced upon a woman in front of a corset advertisement. In a rhyming juxtaposition, the older woman mimics the thinner, younger figure on the wall with an unconscious gesturing of her hands and a squint into the sunlight that echoes the blocked-out eyes of the painted woman: a collage of art and everyday life.',

His change was occasioned by conversation with fellow members in Devětsil, the key Czech avant-garde collective, who had come to feel that reciting poems about misery at workers’ rallies did nothing to advance poetry or actual working conditions. Seifert now evoked metropolitan leisure and spectacle, seeking to inspire ordinary citizens with an affordable book about the revolutionary beauty of their rapidly modernizing environment.

      "description" : 'A professor at the Museum of Applied Arts in Berlin, Karl Blossfeldt made photographs not as art but as visual studies or pedagogical tools for the benefit of artists, designers, and architects. He believed that ornament constituted a pinnacle of human creative achievement, and that its basis lay in the natural patterns of plants and flowers. Blossfeldt collected and photographed plant specimens using a modified camera that could capture minute detail and published his images in <em>Art Forms in Nature</em>, an immediately popular book of 1928 that has remained nearly continuously in print until today. His unsentimental, closely cropped studies aligned with the New Objectivity movement then sweeping photography and fine art in central Europe.',

      "description" : "Hungarian-born László Moholy-Nagy was one of the most influential art teachers in Germany in the 1920s. He taught from 1923 until 1928 at the Bauhaus art school, which united traditional artisanal workshops with industrial manufacturing and mechanical reproduction technologies. In his 1925 book, <em>Painting Photography Film</em>, Moholy argued that film and photography could give essentially new perspectives on art and contemporary life, if only their basic principles were fully understood and exploited. This photomontage is exceptional in its use of ink and in its relatively full composition—many of Moholy’s montages exploit blank space. However, it exemplifies his association of photomontage with the fast pacing and high-keyed humor and terror of the movies.",

      "description" : 'Best known as a sculptor and painter, Gyula Pap first trained at the Graphic Arts School in Vienna (where he learned the basics of photography) and later enrolled in the newly founded Bauhaus to study under the mystic painter and theorist Johannes Itten. Pap began to pursue photography seriously in the mid-1920s, and in 1928, two years after his mentor founded the Itten School, he joined the faculty there to teach graphic arts. This photograph, which Pap made during his tenure at the Itten School, exemplifies the informal, diaristic approach that many Bauhaus students explored in the late 1920s. Its “worm’s-eye” perspective reflects the belief that unusual angles could shake conventional habits of seeing the world, a practice that László Moholy-Nagy called the “New Vision.”',

After the war, Witkiewicz returned to portraiture with a more corporate attitude. In his S. I. Witkiewicz Portrait Firm, the artist offered sitters the chance to pay large sums for a routine (painted) likeness; to pay less, and be portrayed in pastels that pastiched avant-garde styles; or to take (or let the artist take) peyote or mescaline and accept a free portrait drawing that revealed the interior state of mind.<br /><br />From January 22&ndash;April 12, 2015 this work will be replaced by <a href='http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/202956?search_no=36&index=12' target='_blank'>14700&mdash;Link-Belt Type \"D\"</a>.",

Successful before World War I as a purveyor of “Old Paris” to libraries and artists, in his final years (and posthumously) he became a cult favorite of two specific and influential sets—European Surrealists and American documentarians. Atget included this early image of a cabaret in a 1913 album of 60 images called <em>Signs and Old Shops in Paris</em>. He focused here equally on the emblem of “the armed man”—a title (and a tavern) dating to the medieval crusades, rendered in word and image to assure its familiarity to a partially illiterate clientele—and on the maître d, who gazes back through a glass window that also reflects, like a ghost, the likeness of the photographer himself.',

      "description" : "This image was part of a poster at the First International Dada Fair, a raucous 1920 exhibition that marked the apex of Berlin Dada. Heartfield appeared there screaming the words, “Photography will one day suppress and replace all painting.” The image had been commissioned by fellow Dadaist Richard Huelsenbeck for an uncompleted anthology called <em>Dadaco</em>; later Tristan Tzara pasted it into a fully designed maquette for the also unrealized anthology <em>Dadaglobe</em>, and it bears the markings (and tape residue) from this process. With clenched fists and mouth opened in a roar, Heartfield’s image evokes the soapbox agitators who were springing up across Germany at the time, debating questions raised by the country’s defeat in World War I and the momentous civil war and leftist revolutions that immediately followed it in 1918–19.",

For this book, cowritten with progressive architect Oldřich Starý, Sutnar designed a cover that radiated order and freedom simultaneously. The ideal house would be a perfect square in a dynamic grid that left plenty of room for individual circulation across a field of limitless possibilities. Books such as this formed part of a consumer-oriented educational program that Sutnar developed as art director at Cooperative Work, a design consortium and book guild that often worked with the Union of Czechoslovak Crafts, publishers of this particular volume.",

      "description" : "Florence Henri moved through various European avant-garde circles before settling in Paris and then in southern France. In the summer of 1927 she came to the Bauhaus in Dessau, where she befriended László Moholy-Nagy and his wife, Lucia Moholy, both of whom encouraged her interest in photography. In this self-portrait, made just after leaving the Bauhaus, Henri used the mirror to double, bisect, and distort the space of the photograph, asserting formal control over the frame within a frame. Henri consistently challenged male dominance in art and professional spheres and played with gender conventions in her self-representations. A phallic symbolism that structures much photography—the hunt to frame and capture a subject—is ironized here by means of an upright mirror and two shiny balls.",
