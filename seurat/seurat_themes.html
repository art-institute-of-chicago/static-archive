        Seurat was only 26 when he first showed <a href="http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_7.shtml"><i>A 
        Sunday on La Grande Jatte&#151;1884</i></a> at the eighth annual and final 
        Impressionist exhibition in 1886. In scale, technique, and composition 
        it appeared as a scandalous eruption within Impressionism, a deliberate 
        challenge to its first practitioners, such as Renoir and Monet. It immediately 
        changed the course of vanguard painting, initiating a new direction that 
        was baptized &quot;Neoimpressionism.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Seurat died at age 31. He created other ambitious canvases, but<i> La 
        Grande Jatte</i> has remained his definitive achievement. Although the 
        picture was only rarely seen in the three decades following his death 
        in 1891, its visibility was dramatically increased in 1924, when <a href="http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_BirchBartlett.html">Frederic 
        Clay Bartlett</a> purchased the picture and placed it on loan at the Art 
        Institute. It has hung there ever since. Seurat's first major painting 
        to enter a public collection, La Grande Jatte has become an icon, one 
        of the art world's most recognizable images.<br>
        <br>
        The exhibition <i>Seurat and the Making of &ldquo;La Grande Jatte&rdquo;</i> 
        seeks to examine a familiar picture afresh and consider why it has so 
        captured the public imagination. By situating <i>La Grande Jatte</i> in 
        the context of Seurat's artistic development, his dialogue with the Impressionists, 
        and the many preparatory studies produced over the two years of its creation, 
        we can arrive at a richer appreciation of its unforgettable appeal&#151;the 
        way it holds in exquisite balance tradition and innovation, a sense of 
        the momentary and of timelessness, wit and solemnity.<br>

        <span class="text">Nothing about Georges Seurat's upbringing pointed to 
        the revolutionary role he would play in the history of Modernism. Born 
        in Paris in December 1859 into a middle-class family with enough income 
        to support him throughout his life, Seurat began his artistic career conventionally 
        at the prestigious &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts. There he studied under 
        the conservative academic painter Henri Lehmann, a notable follower of 
        the neo-classicist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.<br>
        <br>
        After a year and a half, Seurat quit school. Following one year of compulsory 
        military service, he returned to art, but worked on his own, producing 
        small-scale paintings and drawings. His work in black and white bears 
        the earliest mark of his artistic maturity. This is not surprising, given 
        that drawing was the basis of academic training, preceding lessons in 
        oil paint. The early talent evident in his drawings would blossom into 
        a highly refined and unique style in his paintings by the spring of 1884, 
        when he undertook <i>La Grande Jatte</i>. It is extraordinary that just 
        four years after abandoning art school, Seurat was poised to begin the 
        two-year period of intensive preparation that culminated in his landmark 
        painting.<br>

        <hr size="1" width="100%" align="left">
        <span class="text">When Seurat began painting in the early 1880s he looked 
        to the earthy colors of Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet and other Barbizon 
        artists, whose rustic realism preceded the urban themes and bright colors 
        of the Impressionists by several decades. Seurat produced his paintings 
        from this period, such as <i><a href="selected_01.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Stone 
        Breaker and Wheelbarrow, Le Raincy</a></i>, on small panels that he carried 
        with him in a slotted box. More sketches than finished works, they convey 
        the immediacy and freshness of having been painted quickly on the spot.<br>
        <br>
        These early paintings were informed by the law of contrast as articulated 
        in the writings of M.-E. Chevreul. A noted 19th-century color theorist, 
        Chevreul observed that just as dark and light oppositions enhance each 
        other, any color is likewise heightened when placed beside its &ldquo;complement&rdquo;&#151;located 
        on the opposite side of the <a href="color_wheel.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">color 
        wheel</a>. When the complements red and green are put side by side, for 
        instance, the red will seem redder and the green, greener. Seurat was 
        also aware of how the optical mixture of colors in the eye was different 
        from their mixture on the palette. Juxtaposing related shades of a color 
        on a canvas (yellows and greens for example) will create a more vivid 
        and luminous effect than if the colors had been blended on the palette.<br>
        <br>
        For his understanding of the interweaving of related or opposing tints 
        that excite the eye&#151;&ldquo;divided color&rdquo;&#151;Seurat first 
        looked to the Romantic artist Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix. Later his attention 
        turned to the high-hued palette and brushwork of the Impressionists Camille 
        Pissarro, <a href="selected_17.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Pierre-Auguste 
        Renoir</a>, and Claude Monet.<br>
        <br>
        Seurat&rsquo;s dialogue with these older artists began in 1881. His large 
        pictures of the Normandy coast of Grandcamp demonstrate how, by 1884/85, 
        he had thoroughly transformed their approach to subject matter and technique. 
        The more rigorous order of Seurat&rsquo;s brushwork, seen, for example, 
        in the Normandy coastal view <i><a href="selected_12.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Le 
        Bec du Hoc</a></i> contrasts with the fluttering strokes of Renoir and

        <span class="text">The full scale of Seurat&rsquo;s ambition was first 
        revealed in <i>Bathing Place, Asni&egrave;res</i> (1883&#150;84). Monumental 
        in size, it shares affinities with Impressionism but diverges in significant 
        ways. Its modern subject&#151;men and boys on the bank of the Seine in 
        the working-class suburb of <a href="map.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Asni&egrave;res</a> 
        &#151;was entirely different than the indulgent pastimes pictured by Monet 
        and Renoir. For Seurat, Impressionist spontaneity yielded to a more academic 
        approach, involving 13 preparatory studies, including a <a href="selected_02.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">compositional 
        sketch</a> in the collection of the Art Institute. Some of these preparatory 
        works were paintings done on the spot and drawings carefully modeled in 
        the studio. It was a highly deliberate process.<br>
        <br>
        Five of the figures in <i>Bathing Place</i> are shown looking across the 
        Seine to the island of La Grande Jatte, visible as a clump of green foliage 
        in the upper right. It is this island that, starting on May 22, 1884, 
        would become the next focus of Seurat&rsquo;s artistic energy and ambitions.<br>

        <span class="text">Seurat used the island of la Grande Jatte and the opposite 
        shoreline as the setting for a number of paintings, but he was not the 
        first artist to find inspiration on or near the island. Earlier, Monet 
        had painted several canvases there in 1878, including <i><a href="selected_13.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Springtime 
        on La Grande Jatte</a></i>, which Seurat undoubtedly saw when they were 
        shown in the fourth Impressionist exhibition in 1879. Seurat executed 
        <i>The Seine at Courbevoie</i> (private collection) in the summer of 1885, 
        after he completed his first stage of work on <i>La Grande Jatte</i>. 
        Seurat&rsquo;s viewpoint in this work was on the north side of the island 
        of La Grande Jatte, looking across the river toward the red tiled roofs 
        of <a href="map.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Courbevoie</a>,

        Sunday on La Grande Jatte&#151;1884</a></i> Seurat converted a well-known 
        Impressionist site into an open stage. Across his canvas he positioned 
        a variety of characters that he had developed in his many drawn and painted 
        studies for the work. From these &ldquo;auditions,&rdquo; Seurat eventually 
        selected the performers for the final production, combining the functions 
        of both playwright and director. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Stage:</b><br>
        Seurat used as his setting a small section of the elongated island in 
        the Seine just beyond Paris&rsquo;s city limits. The many dining and dancing 
        establishments, wine shops, and shipbuilders&rsquo; yards located at different 
        points on the island did not make their way into his work nor did the 
        factories across the river, which had undermined the island&rsquo;s social 
        cachet. Seurat focused instead on the green park at the far northwestern 
        tip, facing the town of <a href="map.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Courbevoie</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cast:</b><br>
        Seurat&rsquo;s canvas incorporates 3 dogs, 8 boats, and 48 people who 
        congregate on a Sunday to enjoy and parade around in &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; 
        The cast of modern characters includes soldiers, boaters, the fashionably 
        and casually dressed, the old and the young, families, couples, and single 
        men and women. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Plotlines:</b><br>
        Unlike the setting, Seurat&rsquo;s plot is not readily identifiable. <i>La 
        Grande Jatte</i> conveys grand solemnity in counterpoint with a wry sense 
        of humor. Seurat&rsquo;s stated ambition was to &ldquo;make modern people 
        in their essential traits move about as they do on [ancient Greek] friezes 
        and place them on canvases organized by harmonies.&rdquo; He introduced 
        an element of irony by suggesting a sense of timelessness&#151;in the 
        frozen quality of the figures&#151;while also insisting on a very up-to-the-moment 
        awareness of fashion. The couple in the foreground presents a striking 
        and elegant silhouette, but they can also be seen as somewhat comically 
        puffed-up fashion plates involved in the ritual of self-display.<br>
        <br>
        Relationships between figures are implied, but the characters&rsquo; overt 
        lack of interaction makes it difficult to identify or even imagine the 
        plot. Some have argued that the social order Seurat so elegantly constructed 
        is more tenuous than his rigid composition at first suggests. While the 
        figures appear to fit seamlessly within the whole, their exact social 
        stations and motivations remain open to speculation and debate. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sets and Sources: Past and Present</b><br>
        Seurat was determined to create a new classicism that would remake Impressionism 
        by eliminating the accidental and the momentary, while preserving the 
        vitality of life in forms that embodied enduring ideals. He drew on a 
        variety of sources&#151;ancient and modern, serious and comic&#151;to 
        realize his ambition through a subtle interweaving of seeming contraries. 
        Critics recognized the divergent visual sources that give the figures 
        both modern flatness and anonymity and at the same time a pharaonic (ancient 
        Egyptian) sense of timelessness and seriousness associated with large-scale 
        history painting.<br>

        <span class="text">Seurat began <i>La Grande Jatte</i> in May 1884. Its 
        preparation involved approximately 28 drawings, 28 panels, and 3 larger 
        canvases, including one in the <a href="selected_09.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Metropolitan 
        Museum of Art, New York</a>. Among the drawings included in <i>Seurat 
        and the Making of &ldquo;La Grande Jatte&rdquo;</i> are a view of <a href="selected_04.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">tree 
        trunks</a> and the profile figure of a <a href="selected_10.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">seated 
        woman</a>. These were executed in cont&eacute; crayon, a soft black drawing 
        tool, on textured white paper. The flat, simplified forms of these drawings 
        evoke a certain mystery through Seurat's subtle handling of black and 
        white. Painted studies of figures include the <a href="selected_08.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">strolling 
        woman with the pet monkey</a>; the <a href="selected_03.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">seated

        in the background</a>. The differences in the arrangement of figures in 
        a small <a href="selected_05.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">study 
        of the full composition</a> compared to the final painting reveal the 
        extent of Seurat&rsquo;s adjustments and reworkings during the creation 
        of his masterpiece. Clearly, the artist&rsquo;s self-consciously ambitious 
        project involved calculation, but as the studies show, the creative genesis 
        also involved intuition. They chart the process of thinking and rethinking 
        in which Seurat created, altered, and at times rejected different elements 
        before arriving at his ultimate vision.<br>
        <br>
        Seurat was ready to show <i>La Grande Jatte</i> at the exhibition of the 
        Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants scheduled for March 1885. When this was 
        canceled, he momentarily put the painting aside. In October 1885, he began 
        a second stage of work in which he introduced his latest thoughts about 
        color and its application in the form of small dabs, dashes, and lines. 
        He also altered the shape of figures, adding scalloped and curved outlines 
        to previously starker and more columnar forms in order to create sinuous 
        rhythms.<br>

        <hr size="1" width="100%" align="left">
        <span class="text"><i>La Grande Jatte</i>'s first public appearance was 
        at the eighth Impressionist exhibition in May 1886. Seurat had been invited 
        by senior Impressionist Camille Pissarro, who had also brought along his 
        son, Lucien, and Paul Signac. All four, whose work manifested their interest 
        in the divided-color technique, were put in a room separate from the other 
        participants, including Paul Gauguin and Edgar Degas.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to <i>La Grande Jatte</i>, Seurat showed drawings, painted 
        panels, and canvases spanning his career. <a href="selected_18.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank">Signac</a>, 
        Seurat's friend since 1884, also showed a range of works. These combined 
        his Impressionist manner with areas of distinct strokes that acknowledged 
        Seurat's technique without imitating it closely. Signac's predominant 
        subject matter, the industrial suburbs, however, had no counterpart in 
        Seurat's entries.<br>
        <br>
        Pissarro, who had met Seurat only the previous fall, was now won over 
        from what he termed &quot;romantic&quot; Impressionism to Seurat's &quot;scientific&quot; 
        Impressionism. His chief entry, <a href="selected_15.html" onClick="return popup(this, '')"target="_blank"><i>Gathering 
        Apples</i></a>, shares with <i>La Grande Jatte</i> its large scale, psychologically 
        isolated figures, methodically stiff or primitive poses, overall decorative 
        character, and woven surface appearance. But it was <i>La Grande Jatte</i>, 
        with its monumental figures and controversial technique, that became the 
        most notorious single canvas in the entire exhibition and defined the 
        new direction of painting.<br>
