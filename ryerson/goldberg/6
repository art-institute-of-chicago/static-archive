        <p>Between 1958 and 1973, central Chicago lost 21,000 of its inhabitants to the suburbs. This tidal exodus, which Goldberg had hoped to begin turning back with the construction of Marina City, was still in motion by the late 1960s. In response to this, Goldberg began conceptualizing what was envisioned to become a dynamic and affordable high density, mixed-use "new city center" along the southwestern outskirts of Chicago's Loop. By 1970, consolidation in the railroad and printing industries had left much of the South Loop lifeless and derelict. With Dearborn Station's closure in May of 1971, the sprawling ganglion of railroad tracks south of the station was finally obsolete. Simultaneously, construction of low and middle-income housing in Chicago, both privately and publicly funded, had nearly ceased, and the shortage was palpable. Known as River City, Goldberg's project was intended to help offset the decline in affordable rental units adjacent to the central city, while helping remake a once vibrant area.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1968, in a collaboration with Harris Ward, CEO of the Commonwealth Edison Company, Goldberg set out to build "a new concept of a city" that would be an extension of Chicago's downtown from 350 acres of disused railroad property that stretched from the river to State Street on the east, and from Congress to 18th Street on the south. However, Ward soon fell ill and his replacement brought the development in a new direction, eventually hiring Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill to design what would become know as Dearborn Park. Goldberg believed that he may have been cut loose from the project because "they needed someone with more muscle... and someone who was probably less dreamy... to mature the project."</p>

<p>With the original tract now broken up among several interested parties, Goldberg pushed forward with a smaller but no less ambitious plan to be built in a long, narrow band alongside the east bank of the Chicago River. Despite support from institutions such as the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and Roosevelt University—as well as being told by the White House and HUD that the River City proposal was on "the cutting edge of urbanism"—Goldberg's early, sprawling plan of residential towers, mid-rise apartments, businesses, manufacturing, education, health care facilities, religious institutions, and parkland was never fully realized. Perceived as a conflict with the city's "Chicago 21" plan and competing downtown developments such as the aforementioned Dearborn Park, the project became mired in political limbo for years. A greatly scaled-down River City—one serpentine concrete mid-rise residential structure—was eventually completed in 1984.<br />

Goldberg's response, predicated on the belief that a critical mass of mixed-income housing must be maintained in order to sustain the tax base of a healthy city, was that the FHA lacked confidence in \"the ability of Detroit to survive as a <em>middle-class city<\/em>.\" Detroit had just been, in the previous July, the site of one of the deadliest and most destructive riots in U.S. history, which served only to increase white flight from the city from a steady stream to a frantic deluge.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002272.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"66.5078125","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 6, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/u?\/mqc,14905&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, housing"},"resource_2273":{"resource_link":"..\/2273","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002273.jpg","resource_title":"04.

Unlike Marina City, River City was designed from the beginning to include families with school-aged children. Goldberg felt that, historically, planners had \"failed to plan adequately in... high-rise structures for the complexities of family life... juveniles and... community relationships.\" <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs with Marina City, the primary directives behind River City were to increase the population of the inner city and to provide these residents with jobs and cultural opportunities close to home. Recalling the social engineering of the Hilliard Homes, River City was designed with the intent of creating an \"instant community... comprised of synergistic entities\"*, such as schools, businesses, religious bodies and social clubs. Goldberg noted that as American cities became more pluralistic, many long-standing ethnic and religious communities within these cities fractured and eventually disappeared, leaving a social and cultural void for its residents. He even went so far as to fault himself for failing to create such communities at Marina City. By constructing buildings that foster interaction and communication among its inhabitants, Goldberg hoped to spawn communities within the triads that would generate and sustain what he believed to be the \"currency\" of any neighborhood: \"money, church, food, love, talk and environment.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br \/>\n* Wright and Silverman A Tale of Two Cities, graduate school project, 1988.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002273.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"74.931640625","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 6, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/u?\/mqc,14864&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, Chicago"},"resource_2274":{"resource_link":"..\/2274","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002274.jpg","resource_title":"05. \"The Federal Screwdriver FHA Turns it On.\" Sketch, from Woods Hole urban development conference, Woods Hole, MA, June 1966.","resource_description":"A sketch drawn by Goldberg while attending the Woods Hole urban development conference in 1966, whose theme was \"the rebuilding and restoration of inner [city] areas which are the breeding grounds for social unrest and decay.\" Created by the National Housing Act of 1934 in the wake of the lending crisis that followed the Great Depression, the FHA was intended to regulate interest rates and mortgage terms and to provide affordable mortgage insurance, without which many projects would be impossible to finance.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002274.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"42.810546875","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 6, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/u?\/mqc,14889&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"housing"},"resource_2275":{"resource_link":"..\/2275","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002275.jpg","resource_title":"06.

A September 1975 redesign at the request of Mayor Richard J. Daley, which was reduced to three triads and added some low-rise buildings was also rejected due to a floor area ratio far above what the Chicago Zoning Ordinance then permitted. Unfortunately, scale was critical to the economics of the River City plan and to Goldberg's visions of the new, financially sustainable, residential urbanism that he pursued as a whole. His calculations indicated that the cost of land, financing and overhead\u2014normally approximately 50% of a project budget\u2014 would become closer to 30% at the scale of his original River City scheme. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe plan was reduced again, first to two triads, and then in 1977 to one, with an accompanying 10 story reduction in height\u2014 both times with the belief that they would receive approval after the requested alterations. Despite appealing directly to Mayor Bilandic in 1978, with specific reference to the Department of Planning's \"pattern of replacing each resolved problem with a new problem,\"* approval was again denied. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis plan for a triad and \"Community Service Bridge\" depicts a non-residential floor with rooms for preschool, kindergarten and middle school classes.

Rather than just housing retail-oriented commercial tenants, the original River City scheme envisioned a wide variety of small business types including tech and light industrial. This mixed use concept, however, was contingent on receiving a three million dollar Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG), which offset commercial rents enough to lure incubator businesses. Note the small, white dotted lines in the plan; these indicate the path of a proposed light rail system which was to shuttle residents and employees around the complex.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002276.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"33.08984375","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 6, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/u?\/mqc,8703&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, Chicago"},"resource_2277":{"resource_link":"..\/2277","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002277.jpg","resource_title":"08.

Bertrand Goldberg to Adeline Burns, November 21, 1977.","resource_description":"In this letter to Chicago resident Adeline Burns, Goldberg expresses his frustration at the \"mysterious and... political\" nature of the obstacles encountered in his efforts to bring River City to fruition. In truth, opposition to the project originated from various constituencies. Some plan-ners objected to the high densities of the original River City plan. Julian Levi, chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission, testified that he would block River City from being approved \"not because it was too big... but simply because... you [can't] raise children in high-rise buildings.\" Real estate developers and some city officials also perceived a conflict between River City and the city's <em>Chicago 21<\/em> plan and the neighboring Dearborn Park project. Ultimately, it appears that River City's death knell was the inability to convince politicians that the zoning required for the project would not \"impair their existing clout with the existing electorate.\"","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002279.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"59.9033203125","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 6, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;https:\/\/digital-libraries.artic.edu\/u?\/mqc,14857&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, Chicago"}};
