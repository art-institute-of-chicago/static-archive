        <p>Though the early 1950s may be most notable for bringing Goldberg's more mature prefabricated structures to fruition, other developments such as his nascent use of concrete warrant equal regard. Significantly, it is in this period that Goldberg's diverse influences begin to coalesce into a cohesive architectural philosophy. Goldberg was inspired not only by the tenets of humanism and the structural rigor of the tube, but also by Mies's use of "space as almost something you can mold with your hands," as embodied in his trefoil Glass Skyscraper project for Berlin of 1922. Clad in a sheer curtain wall of glass, Goldberg was also intrigued by the project's "concept of a skin as a nonstructural coating—a container, if you will." By the mid to late 1950s, this transformation which might have begun with the Unicel freight car—predicated on the idea that "the box or the rectilinear form... was a denial... of the differences between people [and] of humanism"—began to bear fruit as seen in the non-linear forms of Pineda Island and Motel 66. The early 1960s saw Goldberg's commissions explode in both size and number, most prominently with Chicago's Marina City (see case 4) and Hillard Homes as well as with his incipient work in health care (see case 7).<br />

Consisting of two 16-story towers of elderly housing and two 18-story arc-shaped towers for family housing, both groups of buildings were built without a structural concrete core. Instead, the outer walls consist of load-bearing, interlocking shells with elliptical windows designed to better distribute stresses on the building skin. As with Marina City, the widening dimensions of the rooms as one moves toward the windows gives the impression of greater interior volume than truly exists.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe success of the Hilliard Homes is not completely understood, but may at least be attributed in part to Goldberg's careful study of complex community relationships which informed many of his later designs\u2014\"Communication makes community,\" he once said. The core of each building was a community room to which the apartments fed, so that residents could intermingle and share. Social systems in the elderly units recall \"the community life around a campfire\" which our ancestors inhabited for millennia, and the circular form of Hilliard is Goldberg's \"direct response to that kind of neighborhood.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOn a broader level, the success of the Hilliard Homes may be attributed also to the fact that \"the architecture gave a message that [the CHA had built] a community... and... simply weren't storing people, which has been the general message of [previous] public housing [projects]. Goldberg felt strongly that people who live in public housing should \"not feel that because they are poor they are being punished.\" But it almost didn't happen. The bureaucrats in D.C. considered the plans were \"too good for the poor\" and that the designs would have been \"better suited to a more artistic element of society.\" However, with the developer Chuck Swibel's help, Goldberg was able to retain his original design, about which he once said: \"I didn't design for the poor, I designed for people.\"","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002239.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"76.943359375","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;http:\/\/digital-libraries.saic.edu\/u?\/mqc,2143&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, Chicago, housing"},"resource_2240":{"resource_link":"..\/2240","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002240.jpg","resource_title":"03.

Hedrich-Blessing, photographer.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOriginally designed as a luxury hotel, the building has since been converted to condominiums. Goldberg's original, circular design for the tower was discarded as being contextually inappropriate with regard to the rectilinear environment of Astor Street. Similar to Marina City, the 300 foot tall concrete core contains elevator systems, stairs and all utilities. The flat floor slabs are supported equally by the core and the exterior concrete columns, which rise dramatically to the 5th (and first exterior) floor. Zoning restrictions on the amount of allowable interior square footage were responsible for the unusual void below the 5th floor; Goldberg simply removed the first five floors and placed them at the top of the building, thereby securing better views and higher rents. One of the most unusual design features of the original building\u2014louvered exterior window shutters which created a haphazard but ever-changing checkered effect\u2014have since been replaced with standard windows, due to problems with rust leading to inoperability.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002245.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"68.0126953125","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, Chicago"},"resource_2246":{"resource_link":"..\/2246","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002246.jpg","resource_title":"09.

ABC \"had conceptualized an office building with large, open floors,\" and Goldberg's program delivered. Based upon a detailed analysis of employment structure and working habits, his design clustered groups of related divisions in their own autonomous space, 16 to a floor, that was \"knitted\" together with office spaces for each groups' executives. In addition, there was \"a communal space in the center where new joint enterprises that involved more than one division could be undertaken.\" Financial difficulties and a corporate reorganization led to the project being remaining unbuilt.","resource_full_text":"","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Archival Material","resource_asset_type":"10","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_002246.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"40.2822265625","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"\"Architecture for Urbanism: Selections from the Bertrand Goldberg Archive,\" Case 3, Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries, November 1, 2011\u2013January 2, 2012<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=&quot;http:\/\/digital-libraries.saic.edu\/u?\/mqc,14885&quot;>Link to R&amp;B Archives Digital Collections record<\/a>","resource_tags_for_resource_id":"architecture, New York"},"resource_2247":{"resource_link":"..\/2247","resource_url":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/citi\/resources\/Rsrc_002247.jpg","resource_title":"10.
