<a name="and" rel="nofollow"></a>
	<strong>Andean region</strong> (<em>n</em>)
    <br />territory defined by the Andes Mountains in western South America. It is common to describe as Andean those people who developed complex societies in this vast region, especially those of coastal and upland Peru and Bolivia. The term may also be extended to include the ancient people who lived in present-day Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and the northern highlands of Chile and Argentina.</p>

<p>
<a name="az" rel="nofollow"></a>
	<strong><a href="../resource/1871" rel="nofollow">Aztecs</a></strong> (<em>n</em>, <em>pl</em>)
    <br />people who, in the 15th and early 16th centuries, conquered a large empire in what is now central and southern Mexico. The Aztecs began as a tribe of hunters and gatherers on the northern Mexican plateau before migrating to the valley of Mexico in the 12th century. They settled on islands in Lake Texcoco and in 1325 founded Tenochtitl&aacute;n, which became the Aztec capital. The Spaniard Hernando Cort&eacute;s (1485&ndash;1547) conquered this civilization in 1519.</p>
    <p>The Aztecsâ€™ success as a society was due to sophisticated farming practices and a powerful military organization and cultural beliefs. The society was governed by a warlord ruler and supported by a priestly and bureaucratic class. At the bottom of the society were serfs, indentured servants, and slaves.</p>
    <p>The Aztecs shared many of the <a href="glossary#cos" rel="nofollow">cosmological</a> beliefs of earlier cultures, most notably the <a href="glossary#teo" rel="nofollow">Teotihuacanos</a>, the Toltecs, and the <a href="glossary#mayan" rel="nofollow">Mayans</a>. Many ritual ceremonies occurred on a rotating basis, set by the Aztec calendar, which comprised a solar year of 365 days and a sacred year of 260 days. Human sacrifice was commonly practiced in Aztec ritual as part of the human obligation to the gods and to maintain the orderly succession of seasons.</p>

Distinctive Chim&uacute; art, including pottery, gold pieces, and textiles, helps date this Andean civilization.</p>
    <p>The Chim&uacute; capital of Chan Chan, located on the northern seacoast of Peru, remains one of the world's grandest archaeological sites, with miles of streets, great walls, reservoirs, and pyramid temples, all constructed out of sun-baked, adobe bricks. At the cityâ€™s height, the population of Chan Chan is estimated to have numbered in the many thousands. The Inca conquerors of Chim&uacute; absorbed much of its old high culture into their own imperial society, including elements of Chim&uacute; political organization, irrigation systems, and road engineering.</p>

    <br />South American Indians who ruled an empire in the <a href="glossary#and" rel="nofollow">Andean region</a> that stretched from the northern border of Ecuador to central Chile. The Inca established their capital at Cuzco (Peru) in the 12th century and began conquests in the early 15th century, eventually forming the largest empire in the ancient Americas. By the time of the Spanish conquest in 1532, the Inca controlled an Andean population of about 12 million people.</p>
    <p>According to Spanish accounts, Incan society was highly stratified. The emperor ruled with the aid of a military aristocracy, exercising harsh and often repressive authority. Inca technology and architecture were so highly developed that irrigation systems, palaces, temples, and fortifications still exist throughout the Andes, most notably at Machu Picchu, Pisac, Ollantaytambo, and Cuzco. The Inca economy was based on agriculture, including the production of quinoa, <a href="glossary#maize" rel="nofollow">maize</A>, potatoes, lima beans, peanuts (groundnuts), cotton, and llama wool.</p>

<a name="mayan" rel="nofollow"></a>
	<strong><a href="../resource/1871" rel="nofollow">Maya; Mayan</a></strong> (<em>n</em>/<em>adj</em>)
    <br /><a href="glossary#meso" rel="nofollow">Mesoamerican</a> Indians who lived in southern Mexico, Guatemala, northern Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador and developed one of the greatest civilizations of the western hemisphere. At its height (250 B.C.&ndash;A.D. 900), Mayan civilization consisted of more than 40 cities, each with a population from 5,000 to 50,000 people. These political and religious administrative centers formed independent, shifting alliances with much evidence of war, though they shared a common culture. In this way, they were similar to the competing Greek city-states of 5th century B.C.</p>
    <p>The Maya are renowned for their innovative methods of agriculture, monumental stone buildings and pyramid temples, gold and copper works, and system of <a href="glossary#hier" rel="nofollow">hieroglyphic</a> writing. The Maya also developed highly sophisticated calendars and astronomical systems. Historical records are still being deciphered from the hieroglyphic inscriptions and royal figures depicted on commemorative monuments known as <a href="glossary#stel" rel="nofollow">stelae</a>.</p>
    <p>By the time the Spaniards conquered the region in the early 16th century, most of the Maya were village-dwelling farmers who practiced the religious rites of their ancestors. Modern Maya-speaking people can be found in rural areas, raising crops of corn, beans, and squash and living in communities organized around central villages.</p>

<p>
<a name="mim" rel="nofollow"></a>
	<strong><a href="../resource/1871" rel="nofollow">Mimbres/Salado</a> culture</strong> (<em>n</em>)
    <br />prehistoric North American people who lived mainly along the Mimbres River and the rugged Gila Mountains in what is now southwestern New Mexico. At its height (between 1000 and 1150), the Mimbres numbered about 5,000 and lived in villages comprising about 200 people each. Because of low rainfall in the region, members of this society depended on irrigation to grow <a href="glossary#maize" rel="nofollow">maize</a>, beans, and squash; they also hunted small game.</p>
    <p>The art of the Mimbres/Salado culture reflects the influences of the related Casas Grandes people of northern Mexico and the Anasazi of northern New Mexico and Arizona. The figural forms and abstract designs found on the <a href="glossary#cer" rel="nofollow">ceramic</a> vessels produced by these cultures are among the most lively and sophisticated in the ancient Americas.</p>
    <p>The Mimbres/Salado eventually dissolved as the people migrated to form new communities in association with others in the larger Pueblo cultural region of New Mexico and northern Arizona.</p>

<p>
<a name="moche" rel="nofollow"></a>
	<strong><a href="../resource/1871" rel="nofollow">Moche</a></strong> (<em>n</em>)
    <br />the dominant society from the first to the 8th century A.D on the northern coast of present-day Peru. The name comes from the archaeological site known as Moche and located in the river valley of the same name. Two giant structures known as the Temple of the Sun (<em>Huaca del Sol</em>) and the Temple of the Moon (<em>Huaca de la Luna</em>) define the site. Dozens of other Moche pyramid-platform sites exist in the coastal valleys of northern Peru. Although many have been looted, others remain unexcavated.</p>
    <p>Like other ancient American cultures, the Moche survived off of agriculture. They guided rivers flowing down from the high Andes into a system of irrigation canals, which allowed for the growth of <a href="glossary#maize" rel="nofollow">maize</a>, potatoes, lima beans, and other staple crops. This system of agriculture supported a dense population.</p>
    <p>The Moche produced sophisticated art, including mold-made pottery admired for its highly naturalistic forms. These vessels&mdash;especially the fine-quality water jars with characteristic stirrup spouts&mdash;bear portrait heads of individuals, animals, plants, buildings, and fantastic beings representing supernatural forces. Painted scenes on some vessels provide visual descriptions of the complex ceremonies and daily activities of the Moche.</p>

    <br />the first complex, state-like society in <a href="glossary#meso" rel="nofollow">Mesoamerica</a>. The Olmec people lived in the hot, humid lowlands along the Gulf Coast in what are now the southern Veracruz and Tabasco states in southern Mexico. Although this remained its native land, Olmec culture influenced central Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador.</p>
    <p>The first examples of Olmec art date from about 1150 B.C. and were found at San Lorenzo, the oldest-known Olmec building site. This site includes many stone monuments, especially colossal carved heads that have characteristic flat faces, thickened lips, and helmet-like headgear. Besides monumental architecture and sculpture, Olmec art includes small jade carvings, pottery, and other media.</p>
