<P CLASS=BodySmall> 20. Schilder (1886-1940) became a professor of psychiatry at the University of Vienna and, after his emigration to New York, a research professor of clinical psychiatry at New York University College of Medicine and Clinical Director at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital. His work on body image became widely known even beyond psychiatric circles: Ernst Gombrich invoked Schilder's researches in his famous lecture on "Psychoanalysis and the History of Art" (1953) in <I>Meditations on a Hobby Horse and Other Essays on the Theory of Art</I> (New York, 1963), p. 34. </P>
