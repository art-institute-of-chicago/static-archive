<P CLASS=BodySmall> 16. Both French and German versions of Bellmer's essay can be found in special 1975 number of <I>Obliques</I>, pp. 82&#150;91; the original handwritten French text, complete with editorial changes but missing the last few paragraphs of the published essay, is reproduced in ibid., pp. 45&#150;55. Peter Webb and Robert Short, <I>Hans Bellmer</I> (New York, 1985), pp. 62, 66&#150;67, include several brief portions of the text in English, as does Henry Okun, "The Surrealist Object" (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1981), pp. 438&#150;40, 442&#150;43. The full English translation appears in Sue Taylor, "The Anatomy of Anxiety: A Psychoanalytic Approach to the Work of Hans Bellmer" (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, in progress). </P>
