<P CLASS=BodySmall>45. Letter from Frank B. Hubachek to M. L. Boynton, May 13, 1963. Hubachek also wrote in this letter that Reynolds's home "became the gathering point and the dispatching point for the spy poste. It was also a Paris station for the escape route. There was a continuous procession of individuals, microfilm, used parachutes, and so on."
