<P CLASS=BodySmall> 1. Hans Bellmer, quoted in Peter Webb and Robert Short, <I>Hans Bellmer</I> (New York, 1985), p. 29. The foregrounding of these three catalyzing incidents by Webb and others ignores two factors that seem most relevant to Bellmer's invention of the doll from a psychological point of view. The 1931 shipment of toys came as his mother broke up housekeeping in Gleiwitz, where Bellmer's father, Hans senior, had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and retired from his job as an engineer. Although he recovered from this stroke, his right arm was still paralyzed when the family relocated to Berlin. The following year, the artist's young wife, Margarete Schnell Bellmer, was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Threatened with loss, Bellmer fashioned a transitional object in the form of a life-size doll&#151;just as a child during weaning, according to the object-relations theories of D. W. Winnicott, may attach to a favorite object qualities of the comforting relationship he enjoys with the mother he is gradually losing; see Winnicott, "Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena," <I>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</I> 34 (1953), pp. 89&#150;97. I owe the information about Hans senior's paralysis, his first name, as well as the birth name of the artist's wife to Ursula Naguschewski, who kindly responded to my inquiries in her letters of July 18, 1994, and February 2, 1996, from Ispringen, Germany. (It was Naguschewski, enrolled at the Sorbonne in 1934, who first brought Bellmer's photographs to the attention of Andr&eacute; Breton in Paris.) I am also indebted to Thomas Bellmer, the artist's nephew, for information about the Bellmer family, which he has shared with me in correspondence and various telephone and personal interviews in Kearney, N.J., from October 1994 to the present. </P>
