<P CLASS=BodySmall> 14. As a result of the declaration of war on September 3, Bellmer was interned as a foreign national at the Camp des Milles in Aix-en-Provence. Max Ernst arrived at the same camp in October, hence Bellmer's portrait drawing of him mentioned in note 3 above. Pressed into the Service Corps of Foreign Nationals in April 1940, Bellmer was demobilized in June of that year. See Peter Webb and Robert Short, <I>Hans Bellmer</I> (New York, 1985), pp. 113&#150;27, and Jacques Grandjonc, ed., <I>Les Camps en Provence: Exil, internement, d&eacute;portation 1933&#150;1944</I> (Aix-en-Provence, 1984). </P>
