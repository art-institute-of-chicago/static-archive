To prepare for their project, the students took a self-guided tour of The Art Institute of Chicago to familiarize themselves with the three painters&#146; subject matter and style of painting.

They were required to make at least one painting &#147;authentic&#148; and at least one painting a &#147;forgery&#148;. Student groups then switched paintings with one another and used a series of tests to determine which of the paintings were authentic based on predetermined criteria. These tests included ultraviolet inspection, microscopic paint chip analysis, and chemical tests that checked for the presence of <a href="g4.html#lead%20chromate">lead chromate</a>, paint layering, or fluorescent paint. After completing the project, a student remarked that &#147;when I come [to the Art Institute], usually it&#146;s to appreciate the beauty of art. This time it was a lot more focused on content . . . and the technique of the artists. It&#146;s nice because I look and can appreciate what the art is about.&#148;</td>

In the second, the class used an <a href="g4.html#ion%20exchange%20matrix">ion exchange matrix</a> to separate pigments by their characteristic charges. During the third portion of the project, students learned how to use a flame test to identify the metals and <a href="g4.html#compound">compounds</a> in paint based on their characteristic flame colors. In the fourth portion, students took a self-guided tour of The Art Institute of Chicago&#146;s Impressionist galleries. This tour prepared them for the final part of the project, in which students learned some basic Impressionist painting techniques. They then wrote research papers on Impressionist artists and created paintings in the Impressionist style. One student wrote, &#147;it was very creative to combine art and science. We noticed art such as pointillism, [in] which like a million and one dots combined to make one picture.&#148;</td>
