                                                <p>Students study selected paintings by van Gogh, Monet and Pollock during a self-guided tour of the Art Institute. They conduct library research into the lives of these three artists and their artistic styles. Students also research the chemical and physical methods for determining the authenticity of a painting. Upon returning from the self-guided tour, the class divides into groups of four. Each student makes three paintings, one each in the style of the three artists. They should try to use subject matter and style typical of each artist. At least one of these paintings will be considered &#147;authentic&#148; and at least one a &#147;copy.&#148; After completing their works, students swap their paintings with the other members of their group, and each student must determine if the painting they have been given is &#147;authentic&#148; or a &#147;copy&#148; through a series of chemical tests. Each group of students then presents its findings before the class in the form of a poster.</p>
                                                <p>To complete this project, students should have had some prior experience with modern methods of instrumental analysis, including mass spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and gas chromatography. Many of the chemical methods used to determine the authenticity of a painting involve these techniques.</p>

                                                  <li>Teams should agree upon what constitutes an &#147;authentic&#148; Monet, Pollock, or van Gogh. For example, one team may decide that a real Monet may be painted on canvas with fluorescent paint but may contain no lead chromate and may have no paint layers or red paint. A real van Gogh may have a different set of characteristics, as will a real Pollock. The teammates must record this information in their lab journals.
										          <li>Each student makes three paintings, one each in the style of the three artists. At least one must be &#147;real&#148; and at least one must be a &#147;copy.&#148; Students are told not to worry about replicating specific paintings; concentrate on creating paintings that show typical subject matter, characteristic brushstrokes, and artistic styles of the artists.
										          <li>3. For each painting, each student selects 2&#148; x 3&#148; piece of backing, makes a pencil sketch of the painting, and then uses the acrylic paints to give the work detail, texture, and color. They should try to convey the same feeling the artist&#146;s work gave them. Tell them that they may layer paints or premix them before applying them to the backing. They may also apply paint heavily to create thick, textured layers.
										          <li>Students use tweezers to embed small crystals of Pb(NO3)2 in the thicker areas of paint. This should be done immediately after applying the paint, since acrylic paint dries quickly. Be sure students cover the crystals with another layer of paint.
										          <li>When the acrylic paint is dry students apply small dots or lines of fluorescent paint to the surface, using the same color as the acrylic paint.
										          <li>Students label the backside of the painting with their name. Paintings are set aside to dry.
										          <li>Students repeat steps 3&#150;6 for their other two paintings.
										          <li>Students record details of what they did for each painting in their lab journals.

										          <li>To test for fluorescence, students place each painting inside the ultraviolet light viewer and turn on the UV light source. Have students record their findings in their lab journals for each painting.
										          <li>To test for the presence of lead (Pb(NO<sup><sub>3</sub></sup>)<sub>2</sub>), students use an X-ACTO knife to remove a small chip of paint from a thicker area. Students place the paint chip into a test tube with 5 mL of 0.1 M K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, shake the test tube vigorously several times, and look for the appearance of a yellow precipitate. Students record all observations.
										          <li>To test for layering of paint, students use the X-ACTO knife to remove another chip from a thick area. Students carefully make very thin slices through the chip, place the slices on a microscope slide, and examine them under a microscope to determine whether the artist used premixed paints or layered paints.
										          <li>After completing all tests on the three paintings and comparing their findings to thier lists that define what a &#147;real&#148; painting is for each artist, what conclusions can students draw? Ask students to explain their reasoning fully in thier lab journals.
										          <li>Ask students: What chemistry-related problems did they encounter? If these were valuable paintings, which tests would have to be used with caution and why? Are there other tests they read about that could be used instead?
										          <li>Ask students: What art-related problems did they encounter? What were these problems? If these were encountered with an actual painting, what courses of action would they take?
										          <li>Homework: Each student writes up his or her findings and conclusions for each painting in a lab journal.
										          <li>Homework: Each team is to bring a backboard for the team report.
