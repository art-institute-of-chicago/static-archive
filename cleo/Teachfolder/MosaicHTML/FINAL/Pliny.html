		<font face="Times">From: Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i> VIII.69</font>
		<p><font face="Times">The Ethiopians give the name of <b>nabun</b> to one (animal) that has a neck like a horse, feet and legs like an ox, and a head like a camel, and is of a ruddy color picked out with white spots, owing to which it is called a <b>camelopardalis</b>; it was first seen at Rome at the games in the circus given by Caesar when dictator. From this it has subsequently been recognized to be more remarkable for appearance than for ferocity, and consequently it has received the name of <b>ovis ferae</b> (wild sheep).</font>
