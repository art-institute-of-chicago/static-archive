		<font face="Times">Homer, <i>Iliad</i> XI.963- (Fagles 1990 trans.)</font>
		<p><font face="Times">&quot;Sprinting close to king Odysseus&#146; fleet</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">where the Argives (Greeks) met and handed down their laws,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">the grounds where they built their altars to the gods,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">there he met Eurypylus, Euaemon&#146;s gallant son,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">wounded, the arrow planted deep in his thigh,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and limping out of battle&#133;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">The sweat was streaming down his face and back</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and the dark blood still flowed from his ugly wound</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">but the man&#146;s will was firm, he never broke his stride.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">And moved at the sight, the good man Patroclus</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">burst out in grief with a flight of winging words,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">&quot;Poor men, Lords of the Argives, O my captains!</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">How doomed you are, look&#150;far from your loved ones</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and native land&#150;to glut with your shining fat</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">the wild dogs of battle here in Troy&#133;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">But come, tell me Eurypylus, royal fighter,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">can the Achaeans, somehow, still hold monstrous Hector?&#150;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">or must they all die now, beaten down by his spear?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">Struggling with his wound, Eurypylus answered,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">&quot;No hope, Patroklus, Prince. No bulwark left.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">They&#146;ll all be hurled back to the black ships.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">All of them, all our best in the old campaigns</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">are laid up in the hulls, they&#146;re hit by arrows,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">pierced by spears, brought down by Trojan hands</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">while the Trojans&#146; power keeps on rising, rising!</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">Save me at least. Take me back to my black ship.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">Cut this shaft from my thigh. And the dark blood&#150;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">wash it out of the wound with clean warm water.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">And spread the soothing, healing salves across it,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">the powerful drugs that they say you learned from Achilles</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and Chiron, most humane of Centaurs taught your friend&#133;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">The brave son of Menoetius (=Patroclus) answered quickly...</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">&quot;&#133;I won&#146;t neglect you, even so, with such a wound.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">And bracing the captain, arm around his waist,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">he helped him towards his shelter. An aide saw them</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and put some ox hides down. Patroclus stretched him out,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">knelt with a knife and cut the sharp, stabbing arrow</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">out of Eurypylus&#146; thigh and washed the wound clean</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">of the dark running blood with clear warm water.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">Pounding it in his palms, he crushed a bitter root</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">and covered over the gash to kill his comrade&#146;s pain,</font></p>
		<p><font face="Times">a cure that fought off every kind of pain&#133;</font></p>
		<dir>
			<p><font face="Times">and the wound dried and the flowing blood stopped.</font>
