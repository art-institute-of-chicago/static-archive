      panels, which originally formed a folding screen, were commissioned by Marguerite 
      Chapin, an American expatriate living in Paris, with whom Edouard Vuillard 
      became infatuated after their meeting in 1910. This panoramic view of teeming 
      Parisian life in the bustling city square known as Place Vintimille is partly 
      based on photographs of the location taken by Vuillard, who shared with 
      his mother a fourth-floor apartment overlooking the square. However, he 
      carefully altered details to create a cohesive overall composition and to 
      accommodate the breaks in the screen panels. Vuillard executed the work 
      in thinly applied distemper (dry pigment dissolved in hot glue), allowing 
      the paper support to show through in places: the soil in the park, the spaces 
      between the paving stones on the street, and the buildings at the upper 
      left. The paper, although originally light beige in color, has darkened 
      over the years</font>.</td>
