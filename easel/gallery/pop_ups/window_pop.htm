      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 12-foot-long 
        <i>Window overlooking the Woods</i> is one of a pair of mural-like paintings 
        Edouard Vuillard painted for the wealthy Parisian banker Adam Natanson. 
        The second canvas, <i>First Fruits,</i> is in the collection of the Norton 
        Simon Museum of Art, Pasadena. Although he depicted a contemporary view, 
        Vuillard may have chosen a palette and ornamental border reminiscent of 
        17th-century Flemish tapestries as a means of connecting his decorative 
        vision to the tastes of his patron, who owned several such tapestries. 
        The painting&#146;s ambitious scale also reflects Vuillard&#146;s experience 
        with theatrical design and popular panoramas, which were either displayed 
        in circular rooms or unrolled before spectators, a portion at a time. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite the fact 
        that he here reduced his landscape to a series of horizontal bands and 
        simplified shapes, Vuillard still believed in the direct observation of 
        nature. <i>Window overlooking the Woods</i> represents the area around 
        L&#146;Etang-la-Ville, a wooded, hilly suburb of Paris where the artist 
        often visited his sister, Marie; her husband, <a href="../../artists/artists.htm#roussel">Ker 
        Xavier Roussel</a>; and their daughter, Annette.</font></p>
