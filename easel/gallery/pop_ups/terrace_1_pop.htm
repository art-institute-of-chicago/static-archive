      Terrace at Vernon</i> can be considered either the second or the last of 
      the three great works showing the terrace and garden vista at Pierre Bonnard&#146;s 
      Normandy home, Ma Roulotte. Although Bonnard began this composition in 1920, 
      he did not completely resolve it until many years later, finishing it in 
      1939, after he moved definitively to the south of France. Even then, the 
      painting must have held a particular fascination for the artist, as it remained 
      in his studio at the time of his death in 1947. It has been suggested that 
      this work was Bonnard&#146;s meditation on his relationships with two women. 
      The figure at center holding an apple may be Marthe de M&eacute;ligny, his 
      longtime mistress and wife as of 1925, while the figure rushing in from 
      the right can be compared to Ren&eacute;e Monchaty, his lover for a brief 
      period who committed suicide in 1925.</font></td>
