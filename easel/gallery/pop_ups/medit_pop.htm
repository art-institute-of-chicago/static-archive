      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In January 1910, 
        Pierre Bonnard received a commission for a nearly 14-foot-tall triptych 
        from the important Russian collector Ivan Morozov. Working from photographs 
        of the work&#146;s intended architectural setting, Bonnard created three 
        panels to fit between columns on the landing of a monumental staircase 
        in Morozov&#146;s home. Completed in 1912, these light-filled scenes of 
        women and children on a terrace were inspired by Bonnard&#146;s stay at 
        a villa near Saint-Tropez. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Following the fall 
        of czarist Russia, Morozov&#146;s collection became part of the state-owned 
        Museum of Western Modern Art in St. Petersburg. On the eve of World War 
        II, the panels were sent to Siberia for safekeeping, where they remained, 
        rolled up in storage, until 1948. In the 1950s, restorers begun to work 
        on <i>Mediterranean,</i> but because of its large dimensions, the work 
        has rarely been on view. In the <i>Beyond the Easel</i> exhibition, these 
        enormous and luminous panels are being shown for the first time outside 
        the State Hermitage Museum.</font></p>
