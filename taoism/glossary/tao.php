		literally, a way or path. Conceived as an empty void, the Tao is also the powerful force 
		capable of creating the universe. From the Tao was generated <I>		qi,</I> the constantly moving energy found in all things, as well as 
		the two complementary forces of yin and yang. To realize the Tao, one must live simply and 
		virtuously, in harmony with nature. When understood or discovered, the Tao provides strength 
		and can lead to immortality. The Tao became the central focus and principle of religious Taoism.
