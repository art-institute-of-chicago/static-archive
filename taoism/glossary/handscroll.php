		a painting or piece of calligraphy made in the form of a horizontal scroll specifically intended 
		for occasional, intimate viewing. Handscrolls are viewed just as Chinese is read: a section at a 
		time, from right to left. Handscrolls vary considerably in length; although some are quite short, 
		others may extend to over 70 feet in length (see scroll diagram).
