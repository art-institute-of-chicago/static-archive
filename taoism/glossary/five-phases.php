		the relationship of nature's five elements (water, wood, fire, metal, and earth) to various 
		natural cycles and phenomena. In Taoism, each of the five elements corresponds to a time of day, 
		direction, and season. Movement from one phase to the next occurs in defined sequences. For 
		instance, water (night, north, winter) eventually becomes wood (morning, east, spring). The 
		Five Phase system also includes the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac (for example, the rat and
		pig are water signs). The movements of the Five Phases are rooted in the cycles of yin and yang.
