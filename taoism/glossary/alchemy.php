		in Taoist practice, a set of procedures and principles meant to prolong human life. In Taoism, 
		there were two types of alchemy: Outer Alchemy consisted of the chemical production of elixirs 
		that were meant to be swallowed; Inner Alchemy, however, relied on symbolic meditation to 
		achieve the same end.
