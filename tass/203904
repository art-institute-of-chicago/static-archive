    <h3><em>Poster-Newspaper Izogiza International Political Review</em>, 1932</h3>

    <p>
    Offset lithograph<br />    1030 x 352 mm<br />    Upper right:<br />
Proletarians around the world, stand up to fight for…<br />
<br />
Upper left: <br />
Poster-newspaper Izogiza International Political Review<br />
1931 was a black year for capitalism.<br />
1932 will be a year of new blows leveled against the capitalist world. A year of new victories for the Proletariat.<br />
<br />
Top right column: <br />
After the war, there were no more blessings for the bourgeoisie and its socialist-fascist servants, than the “Flourishing United States”. The capitalist world was singing victory songs of the American Flourishing. The bourgeois press glorified the new American technical advances and bowed down under the dollar.<br />
<br />
When the crisis broke out, American capitalists tried to reassure the world that there was in fact no crisis. Dozens of times Hoover swore that “soon the normal circumstances will return.” Dozens of times they reassured the American politicians that there was no basis for worry, that American capitalism was indestructible. <br />
<br />
Now already one does not hear these absurd reassurances, these victory songs for the dollar. Now it is clear to anyone that not a trace remains of this American “flourishing”. A famous, bourgeois English writer stated: “All of the American economic system is founded upon risk, and nowhere does the crisis rage with as much ferocity as in America.”<br />
<br />
What then is this flourishing if industry lies on the level of the year 1921, if each day businesses are closing and thousands of workers are thrown out into the street!<br />
<br />
What flourishing if the output of fertile cotton fields is craftily cut in half, coffee is thrown into the sea, and bread fuels the hearth! What then is this flourishing American bourgeoisie, if the American proletariat grows each day! The end has come not only for American flourishing: under threat is the capitalist system worldwide. <br />
<br />
COMRADE STALIN ALSO SAID DURING THE 16th CONVENTION: “THE ILLUSION OF OMNIPOTENT CAPITALISM IS BEING COMPLETELY DESTROYED, THE OMNIPOTENCE OF NORTH AMERICAN CAPITALISM IN PARTICULAR.”<br />
<br />
American capitalism along with global capitalism rolls toward its inevitable historic death. <br />
<br />
Mid Left column: <br />
In the summer of 1931, when the entire financial system of Germany was failing, Hoover stood in the capacity of “savior of the world”. He thought that Europe along with American capital could be saved with a precautionary year-long deferment from the payment of reparations and debts. The bourgeois press cried out that a miracle saved Germany. But on another day, after Hoover’s speech, it was discovered that his suggestion was completely groundless.<br />
<br />
Hoover’s speech did not save German banks from bankruptcy, nor did it save American bankers from destruction. Hoover’s speech could not save English currency from falling, could not stop the destruction of the currencies of 39 capitalist countries in the world. No measures can hinder the freezing of trade between capitalist countries. Hoover’s own speeches could not feed the starving farmers of the United States and could not give jobs to 14 million American workers. <br />
<br />
But the “Miracle of Holy Hoover” not only did not give purpose to the entire capitalist world, but it also turned out to be a well-meant action in actuality having the opposite effect, and for American capitalists, the American parliament, in which sit the representatives of the sturdy treaties and their aides, refuses to continue the deferment given by Hoover to European debtors. American capitalists want to get money from wartime loans; they demand complete payment from post-war bonds, they state in their newspapers; American bankers will not give up without a fight. Hoover ended up with nothing.<br />
<br />
The American bourgeoisie sees its hoarded gold turning into broken pieces of pottery in its cupped hands. THE UNITED STATES ARE BOUND IN THE RING OF THE HOPELESS CRISIS, AND THE CAPITALIST WORLD WITH THEM.<br />
<br />
Lower left column: Illiterate American politicians screamed about the forced labor in the USSR and nothing of this nature was realized. The entire world knows that in a Soviet country, labor is liberated, that in a Soviet country, labor is an honorable thing, a glorious thing, a valiant and heroic thing. It is becoming hard to dupe American workers who now see the obvious guilty party of the crisis.<br />
<br />
The American proletariat is getting ready for final class war. Four columns of the unemployed from all four corners of the country have come to the capital of the SAUS (Soviet-American United States, perhaps?)—Washington. And the International was sung in Washington for the first time.<br />
<br />
The panicked American bourgeoisie search for a way out of the crisis via the new war. <br />
<br />
The American parliament has decided to give out billions of dollars for national defense and not even pennies for the aide of the unemployed. American capitalists estimate that in the capitalist world there is an excess of goods and revolutionary workers. They want to annihilate these workers and goods in the upcoming war. The flourishing of the “world's guardian” has in actuality turned out to be the igniter of war.<br />
<br />
The American capitalists want to use the conflict with Manchuria to provoke the Soviet Union into war. The USSR does not succumb to this provocation, but is always ready for war. We follow the world's politics, but at any moment are ready to counterattack class enemies. We should always be ready. The word of Comrade Stalin during the 16th's Communist Convention has been realized: “THE BOURGEOISIE WILL SEARCH FOR A WAY OUT IN THE NEW IMPERIALIST WAR AND INTERVENTIONS.” <br />
<br />
Along with that, we see the realization of another prediction of Comrade Stalin: “THE PROLETARIAT, WHILE FIGHTING CAPITALIST EXPLOITATION AND WAR'S DANGERS, WILL SEE A WAY OUT IN REVOLUTION.” <br />
<br />
First poem: <br />
Heaven of capitalism personified,<br />
America— long “flourished”— <br />
is proud of its "flourishing:"<br />
"The power of capital is sturdy here!"<br />
And suddenly the rich men's eyes widened:<br />
 Into a country of bankruptcy, damnation, groaning, complaining<br />
Was transformed the "flourishing" country;<br />
The stock of gold was no longer the same—<br />
Stock brokers in the markets cry piteously,<br />
Throw excess coffee into the sea—<br />
So that the price of bread does not fall, they warm their hearths with it.<br />
But unemployment and hunger continue to grow,<br />
And ever more frightening become the thunder-clouds,<br />
Ever louder grow the workers' voices everywhere: <br />
"Employment!" "Bread!"<br />
<br />
Second poem: <br />
And meanwhile, far away is President Hoover himself,<br />
Raising America as a primary example,<br />
Taking aim at European pockets:<br />
“For you—crises, for us—profits!”<br />
The American “helping” plans<br />
Were thus good on the surface!<br />
And here ended the “helping” era,<br />
The wombs of the bourgeois pigs,<br />
And capital, is ready<br />
To send Hoover to the pits of hell!<br />
<br />
Third poem: <br />
Capital in crisis has one thought only: war!<br />
And here brews the commotion in Manchuria,<br />
Arising there is the Japanese cook,<br />
And following his lead, coming in due time,<br />
Will burst the American cooks,<br />
And so that there would be no embarrassment in the brew<br />
Other masters will attach themselves to it,<br />
All together beginning to howl about the “red bandits”<br />
Whose brew interrupts them everywhere.<br />
They will begin to poison Moscow, will do anything, anything<br />
To provoke the Soviet Union.<br />
This is the way, once sobered up,<br />
The whipped capital will not be able to save itself;<br />
Moneybags is doomed to death,<br />
Gunpowder will not heal him, nor will lead.<br />
Where doom lies, there is mindlessness,<br />
And with mindlessness, there is—the end!<br />    Ne boltai! Collection, Obj: 203904</p>
