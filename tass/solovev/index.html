<h3>Born Moscow, 1905; died Moscow, 1990</h3>

<p>In 1930 Mikhail Mikhailovich Solov’ev completed his training as a painter at AKhRR, where he studied with Il’ia Mashkov and Pavel Sokolov-Skalia. Solov’ev was among the most prolific artists working for the TASS studio, designing 157 posters between August 1941 and December 1946. He spent most of his career preparing posters for such publishing houses as Izobrazitel’noe iskusstvo, Izogiz, and Plakat, and during the Cold War, he joined Agitplakat. He was given the title Honored Worker of Arts of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.</p>
