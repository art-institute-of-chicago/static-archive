In 1921, the Liberman family moved to England, where Alexander attended boarding school, continuing his education in France after his family moved to Paris in 1924. While living in Paris, Liberman encountered many other Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s as well as <em>avant-garde<\/em> artists and designers.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=\"..\/artwork\/157091\"><\/a><br \/>\n<br \/>\nLiberman aspired to be a painter, but took a job at <a href=\"http:\/\/ryerson.artic.edu\/record=b518101~S3\"><em>Vu<\/em><\/a>, an early pictorial magazine published in Paris, to support himself. The art director there, Ir&#232;ne Lidova, had worked with <a href=\"..\/resource\/1973\" target=\"_blank\">Alexey Brodovitch<\/a>, and through her, Brodovitch&#39;s design aesthetic influenced Liberman greatly. Liberman left the magazine in 1936 to pursue painting and other arts.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDuring World War II, the family escaped from occupied France by way of Portugal, and in January 1941, they arrived in New York. Liberman and Irving Penn first met that year when Liberman was looking for work and Penn was preparing to leave his position as art director at Saks Fifth Avenue. Brodovitch suggested that Penn discuss the position with Liberman, and according to an anecdote, Penn&mdash;who did not enjoy his work at the department store&mdash;took an immediate liking to Liberman and was happy that he was not interested in the position.1  Shortly after meeting Penn, Liberman was hired to work in <em>Vogue&#39;s<\/em> art department under the tyrannical director M. F. Agha, who promptly fired him after one week of work. Unaware that this had transpired, Cond&eacute; Nast himself hired Liberman to work in the art department, and although Agha never said anything, there was friction between the two. When Agha resigned in 1943, Liberman inherited his position.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDuring the 1940s, Liberman and other art directors including Brodovitch (who had been art director of rival fashion magazine <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em> since 1934) were dramatically changing the design of fashion magazines by including more photographs and experimenting with different fonts and layouts. Liberman and Brodovitch both encouraged their photographers to break from traditional fashion photographs and work in a style that was more suited to the expressions of modernity the magazines were trying to display. At that time, <em>Vogue<\/em> staff photographers included Cecil Beaton, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/artwork\/artist\/Blumenfeld%2C+Erwin\" target=\"_blank\">Erwin Blumenfeld<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/artwork\/artist\/8804\" target=\"_blank\">Horst P. Horst<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/artwork\/artist\/Lynes%2C+George+Platt\" target=\"_blank\">George Platt Lynes<\/a>. Liberman hired Penn in 1943, and together Liberman&#39;s designs and Penn&#39;s photographs abruptly departed from the traditional images published in women&#39;s fashion magazines that featured passive beautiful women and delicate suggestions of the &#8220;good life.&#8221; In contrast, Penn&#39;s <a href=\"..\/fashion\" target=\"_blank\">fashion<\/a> photographs demonstrated a thoroughly modern woman through graphic impact and realistic poses in which models looked directly into the camera lens, and his <a href=\"..\/still-lifes\" target=\"_blank\">still lifes<\/a> for the magazine almost always included a discordant note, such as a piece of rotten fruit, a mouse or a small bug, or some other less-than-perfect element.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLiberman collaborated closely with Penn on many projects, frequently offering an idea, sketch, or concept for Penn to translate into a photograph. The early color work <em><a href=\"..\/artwork\/144827\" target=\"_blank\">Summer Sleep, New York<\/a><\/em> is one such example. Liberman drew a sketch of a woman sleeping behind a screen, and Penn used the idea to execute a meticulously arranged photograph, even taking the time to glue dead flies into place on the window screen. As Penn describes:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSome of the best work for <em>Vogue<\/em>, although it may bear my signature, is in fact ours, the result of a special and close collaboration. The germ of an idea might come from him, perhaps only a thumbnail sketch. I would make a photograph. He would nurse it through the editorial process to the printed page.2<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Small Trades (Petits M&eacute;titiers) series is also the product of their collaboration, this time with Liberman&#39;s concept resulting in a long-term project carried out by Penn in three countries.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 1962, Liberman was made editorial director of all Cond&eacute; Nast Publications, and Diana Vreeland, who had previously worked at <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em>, replaced him as the art director of <em>Vogue<\/em>. In his new capacity, they remained quite close. Liberman supported Penn&#39;s lengthy <a href=\"..\/ethnographic\" target=\"_blank\">travel<\/a> assignments to distant countries during the 1960s and 1970s and included the resulting photographic essays in <em>Vogue&#39;s<\/em> December issues as &#8220;treats&#8221; for readers. It is said that the two treated each other with the utmost respect, always referring to the other as Mr. Penn and Mr. Liberman.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGiven the nature of their personal and professional relationship, it is not surprising that Liberman contributed to some of Penn&#39;s <a href=\"..\/book\" target=\"_blank\">book projects<\/a>, especially those that recontextualized his work for <em>Vogue<\/em>. For example, Liberman wrote the introduction to Penn&#39;s first book <em>Moments Preserved<\/em> (1960) and as well as to <em>Passage: A Work Record<\/em> (1991). In the final entry of <em>Passage<\/em>, Penn writes of his long-time mentor and collaborator: &#8220;1991 marks the fiftieth year since Alexander Liberman and I met, and forty-eight years since we began our work together, a rich and fortunate relationship. He has been for me good friend, teacher, and inspirer.&#8221;3<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n1 Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin Tomkins. <em>Alex: The Life of Alexander Liberman<\/em>. Alfred A.

He served in the Imperial Calvary during World War I, then joined the White Army to fight the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. In 1920, Brodovitch moved to Paris with his wife, Nina, settling with other Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; artists in the Montparnasse neighborhood.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThere Brodovitch first took a job painting houses. As he increased his social contacts among artists, he found more artistic work painting sets for the <em>Ballets Russes<\/em>. His exposure to vanguard art movements such as Constructivism, as well as to the Art Deco style and popular forms of pastiche, fueled an intense interest in photography, typography, and their combinations. Brodovitch began working as a freelance graphic designer, taking commissions for posters, advertisements, and even restaurant menus.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBrodovitch arrived in the United States in 1930 and moved to Philadelphia, where he established the Department of Advertising Design at the Museum School of Industrial Art (now part of the University of the Arts). He introduced his students to cutting-edge magazines and other leading design work from Europe that had not yet had an impact on graphic design in the United States. In 1933, he formed a Design Laboratory course at the college, which met on Saturdays and used contemporary examples and technology to explore innovative design possibilities. As a student at the Museum School of Industrial Art (1934&ndash;38), Irving Penn was one of Brodovitch&#39;s early pupils in the Design Laboratory.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 1934, <em>Harper&#30;s Bazaar<\/em> editor Carmel Snow saw Brodovitch&#39;s work in New York City. She immediately suggested the magazine hire him as an art director. He frequently used Surrealist devices in his layouts, which featured constellations of small photographs, a clever use of white space, and contemporary fonts. Penn assisted Brodovitch during the summers of 1937 and 1938 in the art department of <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em>, where he worked on layouts and made drawings or took photographs to illustrate articles. After Penn finished art school, he worked full time at the magazine and was exposed to photographers such as Martin Munkacsi and George Hoyningen-Huene, who were beginning to change the look of fashion photography.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBrodovitch frequently took on extra projects and jobs outside of his duties as art director of <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em>. From 1935 to 1937, he photographed several ballet companies using a 35mm camera and slow exposure time. The resulting ethereal images were published in the 1945 photographic book <a href=\"http:\/\/ryerson.artic.edu\/record=b486736~S1\"><em>Ballet<\/em><\/a>. In addition to personal projects, Brodovitch often sought out freelance design work. In 1939, Brodovitch took a position at the upscale New York City department store, Saks Fifth Avenue. He designed a variety of products for the store, including advertisements, logos, and wrapping paper. Penn worked there as his assistant, and later inherited the position when Brodovitch left in 1941 to take on another freelance position at I. Miller Shoes. In addition to his work at the magazine and freelance commissions, Brodovitch continued to teach his innovative Design Laboratory classes, which from 1941 to 1966 were held as evening sessions in New York City.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDuring the early 1940s, Brodovitch and other art directors including <a href=\"..\/resource\/1972\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Liberman<\/a> (who became art director at the rival fashion magazine <em>Vogue<\/em> in 1943) were responsible for dramatically changing the design of magazines by including more photographs, experimenting with different fonts and layouts, and seeking different work in photography to match the expression of modernity in their new designs. The dynamism Brodovitch demanded was found in the era&#39;s rising photographers: Penn, who began working at <em>Vogue<\/em> in 1942, and Richard Avedon, who worked at <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em> from 1945 until he moved to <em>Vogue<\/em> in 1966.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTwo fires in 1956&mdash;one at his farmhouse in Pennsylvania, the other at his home in East Hampton, Long Island, New York&mdash;caused Brodovitch great personal loss, including the destruction of much of his life&#39;s work. Brodovitch, who struggled with alcoholism, was fired in 1958 from <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar<\/em>. His wife Nina died the next year, inducing a severe depression for which (along with the alcoholism) he was often hospitalized beginning in the 1960s. In 1967, after breaking his hip, Brodovitch left the United States for a village in southern France, where he died in 1971.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 1972, the Philadelphia College of Art posthumously awarded Brodovitch a doctorate of fine arts and mounted an <a href=\"..\/exhibition-history\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition<\/a> titled <em>Alexey Brodovitch and His Influence<\/em>. The exhibition catalog for the 1972 show contains quotations by many of the artists and designers Brodovitch mentored throughout his long career. Penn, one of Brodovitch&#39;s early prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, said of his teacher and first professional mentor:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis curious, remarkable man who managed somehow to germinate seeds of talent unknown even to the person who carried them. He did this with such regularity and over such a long period of time that chance could not be the explanation.1<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n1 Alexey Brodovitch. <em>Alexey Brodovitch and His Influence<\/em>, Philadelphia College of Art, Philadelphia, 1972, p. 10.","resource_types_for_resource_id":"Artwork and Artist Information","resource_asset_type":"50","resource_image_thumbnail":"..\/images\/Rsrc_TN_001973.jpg","resource_asset_type_label":"","resource_file_size":"0.0 kB","resource_file_size_unformatted":"5.740234375","resource_grade_level":"","resource_curriculum":"","resource_tour":"","resource_file_time":"00m 00s","resource_file_time_unformatted":"0","resource_source_detail":"","resource_tags_for_resource_id":""}};
