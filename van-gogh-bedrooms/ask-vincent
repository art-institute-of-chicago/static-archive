      <h1>Ask Vincent</h1>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was a prolific letter writer, and amid his musings on family relations, art and artists, and women, he dispensed solicited&mdash;and unsolicited&mdash;advice. In celebration of the exhibition <em>Van Gogh’s Bedrooms</em>, we offer some words to the wise, penned by the artist himself.</p>

              <p>I recently graduated from college and am living on my own in the city for the first time. I have become great friends with my new roommates, but find I am regularly succumbing to their peer pressure. I work two jobs, but have a hard time turning them down when they ask me to meet them out for drinks that turn into dinner that turn into me stumbling home at 2:00a.m. I’m exhausted, but I love experiencing all the city has to offer and have a hard time saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to my friends.

              <p>If one wears oneself out during these years then one won’t live beyond 40. If one conserves enough strength to withstand the sort of shocks that tend to befall one, and manages to deal with various more or less complicated physical problems, then by the age of 40 to 50 one is back on a new, relatively normal course.

              <p>Dear Resolute:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>If we want to live and work we must be very careful and look after ourselves. Cold water, fresh air, simple good food, decent clothing, a good night’s sleep, and no worries. (May 1888)</li>
                <li>No womanizing or living the good life whenever you feel the urge. (May 1888)</li>
                <li>Learn how to dance, or fall in love with one or more notary’s clerks, officers, in short, any within your reach—rather, much rather commit any number of follies than study in Holland. (ca. September 1887)</li>
                <li>Take as much spring air as possible, go to bed very early, because you must have sleep, and as for food, plenty of fresh vegetables, and no bad wine or bad alcohol. And very few women, and lots of patience. (May 20, 1888)</li>
                <li>You do very well to be reading the Bible. (June 23, 1888)</li>
                <li>You must try to acquire an iron constitution, a constitution that will allow you to grow old, you ought to live like a monk who goes to the brothel every two weeks—that’s what I do myself, it isn’t very poetic, but I feel it’s my duty to subordinate my life to painting. (June 23, 1888)</li>
                <li>Take baths. (July 25, 1888)</li>
                <li>Now, for those of us who work with our brains, our one and only hope of not running out of steam too soon is to prolong our lives artificially by observing an up-to-date health regime as rigorously as we can. I, for one, do not do all I ought to. (July 25, 1888)</li>
                <li>As for drinking too much . . . I have no idea if it’s a bad thing. Take Bismarck, who, think what you like, is very practical and very intelligent—his good doctor told him that he drank too much and that he’d been putting a severe strain on his stomach and his brain all his life. B. stopped drinking at once. He has gone downhill ever since and is still getting no better. He must be laughing up his sleeve at his doctor, whom, luckily for him, he did not consult sooner. (July 25, 1888)</li>
                <li>In the end, we shall have had enough of cynicism, skepticism, and humbug, and will want to live—more musically. (September 24, 1888)</li>

              <p>Dear Vincent:</p> <p> I've been reluctant to draw or paint ever since I was a little girl. On the one hand, my sister is highly gifted and any drawing I would make looked childish and lousy compared to hers. I must admit this could be truly discouraging, so I gave up the whole idea of becoming an amateur painter. </p> <p> Time went by and I haven't even dared take up a pencil, let alone a brush. To make matters worse, I'm often in touch with great works of art, which I find amazing but also intimidating. </p> <p> Vincent, I must confess something to you, though: as of late, I've had the compelling need to express my feelings through art.
