					<em>Focus: James Bishop</em></a>
					<br>March13&ndash;May 4, 2008</span>
					<p>James Bishop (b. 1927) is an American artist who has lived primarily in France since 1958. His approach to painting and drawing is marked by a poetic, reductionist tendency; his palette is restricted, sometimes, but not always precisely, monochromatic. This exhibition, co-organized by the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung Munich and the Josef Albers Museum Quadrat Bottrop, will bring together roughly sixty drawings and paintings on paper from Bishop's personal collection, along with selections from private collections in Germany, Switzerland and the United States. Additionally, the Art Institute will present a small selection of works on canvas, including two recently acquired works, <em>Early</em>, 1967 and <em>Untitled</em>, 1980.</p>
					<p>This exhibition is made possible by a grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Ongoing support for focus exhibitions is provided by the Alfred L. McDougal and Nancy Lauter McDougal Fund for Contemporary Art.</p>

					<em>Focus: Mario Ybarra Jr.&mdash;Take Me Out...</em>
					<br>May 29&ndash;August 24, 2008</span>
					<p>Mario Ybarra Jr. (b. 1973) is a visual and performance artist, educator and activist who combines street culture with fine art in order to produce what he calls "contemporary art that is filtered through a Mexican-American experience in Los Angeles." This exhibition is a comparative study of Los Angeles and Chicago using as its base the chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. and his business ventures in both cities. Through extensive archival and anecdotal research, Ybarra will draw parallels between these two cities' cultural idiosyncrasies and similarities. The exhibition will consist of a satellite component, featuring an artist's multiple at Chicago's Wrigley Field, in addition to an installation at the museum including drawings and photographs by the artist, historical objects, and ephemera.</p>
