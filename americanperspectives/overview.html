American Perspectives offers visitors the extraordinary opportunity to view groundbreaking exhibitions of American masters Jasper Johns, Edward Hopper, and Winslow Homer from a new vantage point. A lively assortment of performances, lectures, poetry readings, and gallery talks&mdash;featuring the work of some of the country's most prominent artists, writers, performers, and composers&mdash;examines the many and varied threads that create our historical and cultural fabric.</p>

			<br><em>A Season of Art</em></p>
			<p>Celebrated for its world-renowned collection of Impressionist painting, the Art Institute is also home to one of the most comprehensive displays of American art in the nation. These two strengths play off each other in endless and intriguing ways, from artists such as Mary Cassatt who perfected their art abroad to savvy collectors who brought European treasures to Chicago to artistic pioneers like Grant Wood who advanced an artistic tradition rooted in America's landscape and culture. This year the Art Institute salutes American artistic vision, old and new, with special exhibitions of work by Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Richard Misrach, and Edward Ruscha, and a wealth of exceptional programming.</p>
