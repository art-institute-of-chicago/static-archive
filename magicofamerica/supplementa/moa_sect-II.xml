                    <p>But time is short. Looking at the destruction already wrought, at the
                        materialism growing on every side, at the increasing bitterness and unrest
                        throughout the world, at the tremendous power of our latest weapons, a
                        realist might well conclude that many of us now living will see the start of
                        a war which will end in more dark ages.</p>
                    <p>There is no materialistic solution, no political formula, which alone can
                        save us. Man has never been able to find his salvation in the exact terms of
                        politics, economics and logic. From Plato's Republic to Roosevelt's United
                        Nations, his planned Utopias have not proved the answer, for the answer is
                        at a deeper level.</p>
                    <p>Our salvation, and our only salvation, lies in controlling the Arm of Western
                        Science by the Mind of Western philosophy guided by the eternal truths of
                        God. It lies in the balanced qualities of spirit, mind and body of our
                        people. Without this control, without this balance, our military victories
                        can bring no lasting peace, our science no lasting progress.</p>

                    <p>The rebirth of Town Planning in recent times we owe to Griffin who
                        established the profession, and to Mr. James Alexander Smith of Australia in
                        awakening the world by bringing Canberra to birth, the plan and the city,
                        through world wide competition.</p>
                    <p>Two members of Parliament - Mr. O'Malley <note>King O'Malley</note> and Mr.
                        Webster <note>William Webster</note> fought the battle against bureaucracy,
                        the Empire, through till Canberra became an established fact.</p>

                        absurdity of private ownership of land since feudal times wiped out
                        practically all vestiges of community planning so that our communities on
                        the whole are nothing but slums, even the Gold Coasts.</p>

                        Architectural Record</bibl>
                    <p>In the capital city of the Commonwealth of Australia modern theories in city
                        planning are applied on a scale heretofore unknown. At the time of the
                        organization of the Commonwealth provision was made for the creation of a
                        new Capital in preference to utilizing for that purpose either of the
                        leading cities of the Commonwealth, and a Federal District corresponding to
                        our District of Columbia was established in the Yass-Canberra region of New
                        South Wales. The Plan of Walter Burley Griffin of Chicago provides for a
                        city having an area of approximately twenty-five square miles. In its
                        essential outlines the city is completely planned, while the arrangement of
                        the federal and other public groups is developed in considerable detail.</p>
                    <p>The location is about midway between Sydney and Melbourne and seventy five
                        miles from the east coast of Australia. The site is a valley having a
                        general elevation of two thousand feet above sea level and is bordered by
                        hills and mountains. Two prominent peaks, Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain,
                        rise abruptly out of the northerly part of the valley. On the southerly edge
                        is a low-lying mountain, Mugga-Mugga, and sheltering forested ranges
                        culminating in the distance in the snow-capped peaks of the Murrumbidgee
                        watershed.</p>
                    <p>Scattered over the valley are a number of lesser hills among which are
                        Kurrajong, Camp Hill, Vernon, Russel and Shale. A stream known as the
                        Molonglo River flows through the site from east to west. A determining
                        factor in the plan of the city is the form of the valley which, as will be
                        noted on the map, is irregular. It is evident that while presenting a number
                        of serious problems this site furnishes a magnificent setting for a city of
                        monumental character.</p>
                    <p>The city consists of a group of connected functional centers. In an ordinary
                        city a gradation in relative requirements from centers of lines of activity
                        would be sufficient; but in a capital city the problem of distribution of
                        centers in accordance with their relative</p>

                            Foliage gracefully droops toward the waters as they thread their
                            sparkling way across Canberra to the hills, all evergreen."]</p>

                    <p>importance becomes much more complex. The functional centers provided for are
                        as follows:- Federal, municipal, educational, recreational, manufacturing,
                        market, residential and agricultural.</p>
                    <p>The central portion of the city is designed with reference to two axes placed
                        at right angles to each other. One, designated as the land axis, extends
                        from the summit of Mount Ainslie through Camp Hill and Kurrajong, and has
                        its distant terminus in the peak of Mount Bimberi thirty miles to the
                        southwest, it being a fortunate coincidence that the line joining the
                        summits of these two mountains passes through the two lesser hills. The
                        secondary axis, designated as the water axis, extends from the summit of
                        Black Mountain to a prominent point on the shore of the upper lake. These
                        axes lie midway between cardinal and diagonal points of the compass. Since
                        this is recognized as the most favorable orientation with reference to
                        sunlight and shade in a warm climate, the federal and other public groups
                        are located parallel to these axes.</p>
                    <p>The Molonglo River is utilized for the development of five lagoons, two of
                        which have shore lines determined by the topography, and three of which are
                        architectural in form. These lagoons are designed as the central feature in
                        the architectural setting, and determine the location of the public groups.
                        The fall of the river is slight, and a weir dam of moderate height is
                        sufficient for impounding the water for the four lower lagoons. For forming
                        the upper lake a dam with sluiceways for regulating the flood waters is
                        provided. This dam will also serve for carrying the railway across the
                        waterway.</p>
                    <p>Since the prime object of a federal capital is the housing of various federal
                        activities, the federal group is the one of dominating importance, and is
                        therefore given the central position. A further consideration is that such
                        activities are largely deliberative and require an accessible but quiet
                        location. The center of</p>
                    <pb n="3"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 3 ====]</p>
                    <p>the federal group is at Kurrajong Hill, on the land axis. From this center
                        radiate one avenue to the north through the Municipal Center and continuing
                        through the Manufacturing Center at the northern limits of the city, and
                        another avenue to the northeast terminating in the Market Center. On the
                        crest of Kurrajong is the administration building, flanked on the east by
                        the premier's residence and on the west by the governor general's residence.
                        In the triangle formed by the two radial avenues and the south shore of the
                        central lagoon is the federal group.</p>
                    <p>The crest of Kurrajong is about one hundred and sixty feet above the general
                        level of the valley. From this hill the ground slopes to Camp Hill, and
                        thence to the lagoon. This feature of the topography has been utilized in a
                        series of terraces on which the parliament and departmental buildings are
                        located. As will be seen from the above tabulation this group is developed
                        in sequence of function. Driveways wind in and out among the units of the
                        federal group. Connection between driveways on different levels and between
                        driveways and main radial avenues is made by means of ramps.</p>
                    <p>Across the lagoon from the watergate recessed into the hill to avoid
                        obstructing the view along the land axis is the stadium. The museums,
                        gymnasium and baths are located along the north shore of the lagoon between
                        the radial avenues, the intermediate and adjoining spaces being used as
                        public gardens. North of the gardens are the theatre and opera and several
                        other buildings devoted to public and non-utilitarian uses. Continuing on
                        the land axis north from the stadium is Ainslie Parkway, terminating in
                        Ainslie Park on the lower slopes of the mountain. This entire group, to be
                        used in general by the people as distinct from their representatives and
                        agents, comprise the Recreational Center.</p>
                    <p>At the Municipal Center are the buildings required for conducting the
                        business of the municipality, while surrounding this center is a district
                        devoted to the administration of financial and</p>

                        generally.</p>
                    <p>It is planned to locate the important wholesale and retail establishments
                        around the Market Center. At this center will also be located the central
                        railway station. The streets connecting the Market and Municipal centers
                        will form a shopping district.</p>
                    <p>West of the Municipal Center is a large group of buildings forming the
                        commonwealth university. These buildings are arranged in logical sequence
                        and radiate from the centers in the order given below.</p>

                    <p>The building devoted to each natural science is correlated to the group of
                        buildings devoted to its derivative theoretical sciences, and the same
                        principle is observed in correlating the theoretical and applied sciences.
                        This principle is carried further in locating different sciences adjacent to
                        facilities for illustrating their theory and application. In the application
                        of this principle the school of law is located on the side nearest the
                        Municipal Center. The school of agriculture is adjacent to the botanical
                        gardens, which extend inland from the west shore of the lower lake, while
                        the school of medicine is adjacent to the hospital which occupies the small
                        peninsula jutting into the west circular lagoon. On the east slope of Black
                        Mountain is a district to be known as University Heights, and to be occupied
                        by residences for the University faculty and dormitories for the students.</p>
                    <p>The various centers are laid out in polygonal form, both the hexagon and the
                        octagon being used. Such an arrangement results in a multiplicity of obtuse
                        street angles within the polygons and, owing to the relative positions of
                        the different centers, in the</p>
                    <pb n="5"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 5 ====]</p>
                    <p>intermediate sections as well. With the exception of the main avenues
                        practically all streets will be discontinuous or will have vistas closed by
                        obtuse angles, a condition furnishing excellent opportunity for informal and
                        picturesque treatment by means of residences or otherwise. At the same time
                        this plan provides rectangular building between points of junction of the
                        different systems thus formed. It was considered advisable to leave certain
                        tracts to be laid out and developed according to individual initiative. For
                        this purpose many of the blocks in the intermediate sections are made of
                        unusual size. These blocks, in whole or as subdivided, are available as
                        sites for institutions of various kinds, horticultural gardens, playgrounds,
                        enclosed residential courts, etc.</p>
                    <p>The modern tendency in city development is toward long alignments of trade
                        along lines of communication. With the long avenues connecting the centers,
                        as provided in this plan this tendency is encouraged. The plan is such,
                        however, as to discourage the spread of trade into adjacent territory, since
                        the intermediate streets, owing to discontinuity or change in direction, are
                        ill adapted to use as thoroughfares and are therefore unattractive as
                        locations for trade. In this way permanently quiet zones are provided that
                        are suitable for residential purposes and, at the same time, are convenient
                        to lines of trade and communication.</p>
                    <p>Main avenues are planned for a width of 200 feet. They will be divided by
                        parkways into three separate arteries of travel to provide for fast and slow
                        vehicles and tramways. It is designed so to locate the tramways in the
                        intermediate sections that at any point in the city will be within five
                        blocks of a tramway. The Federal Center is the focus and transfer point of
                        all tramways in the city. Tramways will be laid in the avenue encircling
                        Kurrajong Hill, and connections will be provided to lines on each of the
                        radial avenues.</p>
                    <p>The railway throughout the city will be depressed 12' below the street level,
                        all streets being carried over the tracks by means of</p>
                    <pb n="6"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 6 ====]</p>
                    <p>viaducts. The central station is at the Market Center where the railway
                        passes through a tunnel under the slopes of two hills. A local station will
                        be provided at each of the other centers passed through. The railway yards
                        are located immediately south of the Manufacturing center.</p>
                    <p>As would be expected in view of Mr. Griffin's well known canons of design,
                        the buildings of the public groups if built according to his recommendations
                        will consist of compositions in line and mass designed with reference to the
                        purposes of the buildings and the requirements of the materials used, and
                        independently of all historical styles. Reinforced concrete and marble are
                        recommended by him as the materials best suited to the purpose. A study of
                        the plans reveals remarkable success in utilizing prominent points for
                        aspect and prospect. In this connection it is only necessary to call
                        specific attention to Mount Ainslie and Kurrajong Hill, both visible from
                        all parts of the city and both commanding the widest possible view of the
                        city and its mountain background. J.E.M.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>Town Planning is a very broad concept. It may call for the perfect solution
                        for a single lot or for any other unit such as municipality, state,
                        continent or world.</p>
                    <p>The world solution is a primal element and should be tackled without delay
                        since humanity is now a unit for since the Christ gave the individualized
                        Ego - "that light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" - to
                        every man in the world there is no longer any difference between races, and
                        there should be no artificial boundaries erected between them.</p>
                    <p>1st. The simplest World Organization would be a World Economic Organ - this
                        first which is now aborning in the United Nations group.</p>
                    <p>2nd. An Abilities Organ to free everybody's individual capacities.</p>
                    <p>3rd. A Social Organ to maintain Equity which is naturally having a hard time

                    <p>THE CITY PLAN OF GRIFFITH - IRRIGATION CAPITAL - NEW SOUTH WALES -
                        AUSTRALIA<lb/> Walter Burley Griffin - Architect.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL - Griffith, so named in honor of the late New South Wales Minister
                        for Public Works, is designed to be the capital of the great Murrumbidgee
                        Irrigation District in the southern part of the state. It is established as
                        the terminus of a main line of railway that is being by degrees extended
                        westward into the interior of the State and the continent.</p>
                    <p>THE SITE - Forty miles west-northwest of Leeton, the site occupies gently
                        rising land, including some slightly marked offshoots from the western end
                        of the southern convex base of a crescent-shaped, sharply-defined ridge
                        known as the Macpherson Range, rising here to 250 ft. above the level of the
                        Australian plateau which from this side stretches almost flat indefinitely
                        into the distances.</p>
                    <p>Situated in a central position on the main irrigation canal, 91 miles from
                        the Murrumbidgee River, this site is near the northern border of the whole
                        irrigation tract which will stretch 50 miles to the east, ten miles to the
                        south, 40 miles to the west, and seven miles northwest. Surrounded by grassy
                        plains, the slopes of this virgin site are openly wooded, chiefly with
                        blue-green, cypress-like callitris trees interspersed with small eucalyptus
                        Mallee and Yarran. The main canal, which will flow through the lower portion
                        of the city, will be of service for irrigation to only its smaller lower
                        portion, but a high level channel, part of a projected pumping scheme, may
                        serve for the bulk of the remainder of the city.</p>
                    <p>The headquarters of the Irrigation Commission, with authority over the entire
                        Murrumbidgee project of nearly 3000 square miles, Griffith is designed as
                        the seat of administration, law, and education for this very important
                        section of the State, in addition to its functions as the commercial
                        distributing center for a considerable area, comprising not only the early
                        developed and perhaps most promising section of the irrigated lands, but an
                        almost equal area of non-irrigable agricultural and pastoral regions
                        accessible around the end of the ridge. Not merely</p>

                    <p>is this to be a railway terminus for the period that this north-westward
                        projection of the line from Sydney and the east is deferred, but it is due
                        eventually to make a distinct change in direction for three lines, counting
                        a line through Wilbriggie (a point on the New South Wales main South-western
                        line 15 miles southward), intended to join the Victorian system beyond, and
                        thus reach the southern coast ports.</p>
                    <p>For that time Griffith as a railway focal point must be prepared to carry on
                        effective exchange and transfer business arising through its special
                        facility for direct shipment, involving a minimum of switching and
                        re-handling, with consequent economy as a point for breaking of bulk goods,
                        and with the resultant depots, stores, and markets. The alternative of
                        almost equally distant Pacific and Antarctic Oceans may be assumed to be of
                        increasing advantage to this location as new and more favorably competitive
                        ports are opened up.</p>
                    <p>Through these considerations it is evident that wide latitude for expansion
                        and a considerable degree of convertibility in uses of land and broad
                        generalizations of comprehensive classification are required in the plan.</p>
                    <p>Assuming as a modest estimate 30,000 for the population, a circle, of radius
                        one and a quarter miles, centered where the main wide avenue crosses the
                        railway in front of the post office, provides accommodation as follows:-</p>

                    <p>OCCUPATION.- As is evident by the arbitrary circular boundary line, the short
                        radius assumed, and the balanced character of the development allowed for,
                        any question of expansion to a possibly disproportionate population is
                        answered.</p>
                    <p>Of the circumscribed city site about 20 percent is dedicated to communal
                        purpose not including communication ways, and about 50 percent to private
                        purposes. Increase of radius will but slightly alter these relations since a
                        proportionate sector of the main reservation, Ridge Park, naturally withheld
                        from other development, being of poor adaptation, will be embraced, and
                        since a consistent system of local reserves is clearly indicated throughout
                        the extensible general arrangement.</p>
                    <p>A maximum of square corners and the avoidance of acute angles is sought to
                        reduce waste, as well as ugliness in buildings.</p>
                    <p>BUSINESS.- The central point in the plan which is clearly here the spot most
                        uniformly accessible from all portions of the city, marks at the same time
                        the point of access from the outside world by railway, and therefore may be
                        counted upon to fix the starting point and also the perpetual business
                        center.</p>
                    <p>COMMERCE.- As such it must be adapted finally to retail trade purposes to
                        which the highest land values may be expected to attach. The influence of
                        this advantage, extending in all directions as the city grows will in time
                        make it economical to do the necessary filling and construction work
                        required to carry the two parallel streets that will afford additional
                        thoroughfare across the East-west railway trafficway without interruption of
                        grade or traffic. These two streets are, of course, indicated on the plan,
                        but in advance of their execution the railway station grounds will extend
                        that much closer to the main business avenue axis while the corresponding
                        markets may also in the meantime be accommodated on either or both sides of
                        the track in independent sections.</p>
                    <p>The provision for these markets is on a scale to permit of the sale of
                        produce direct from the carts of the producers effecting a most </p>
                    <pb n="10 or 10c"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 10 or 10c ====]</p>
                    <p>intimate contact between production and consumption, and assisting to
                        diminish the cost of living. The markets being central public structures
                        cannot, of course, occupy the main street because of their bulk and their
                        interruption with private shops, which demand continuity, but by an open
                        passage-way connecting the market entrance with the post office these two
                        permanent features of the civic architecture in the commercial zone are
                        opposed and displayed to the best advantage, and through their alignment
                        with the station, which is the gateway to the city, they may insure the
                        visitor's favorable first impression.</p>
                    <p>Central retail merchandising is provided for not only along the main avenue
                        or axis, but on the curved streets connecting it with the main radial
                        thoroughfares and their attendant parallels by which all the customers must
                        approach. Allotments for business are of a maximum depth of 160 feet and are
                        provided with rear shipping ways 30 ft. wide. The typical frontage width is
                        30 ft. in order to allow of the most economical spans to fix a serviceable
                        minimum limit of shop. Extending radially from the markets and the station
                        along the lines of the railway are the business districts to accommodate the
                        storage, sale, and handling of the wholesale merchandise and retail bulky
                        goods. Along these lines, which pass underneath the main avenues of the
                        city, it is possible to accommodate with a minimum of interruption all the
                        long distance wagon haulage as additional to rail transportation from the
                        country to the market, and the driving of stock as well.</p>
                    <p>MANUFACTURING.- On the eastern leeward line in a narrow valley special
                        provision is made for the beginnings of manufactures where there is the
                        greatest possibility of concealment and minimum annoyance as well as
                        proximity to station, the shunting yards and team tracks adjoining. The
                        district is served only by vehicular traffic lanes flanking the whole
                        reservation clear of all switching operations.</p>
                    <p>Manufacturing, especially through extractive processes, may become an
                        important feature here, and for elasticity in case attenuation becomes too
                        great in one direction from town, it is evident that a </p>
                    <pb n="11"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 11 ====]</p>
                    <p>re-disposition of the traffic lanes on the other lines, either the south or
                        north-west railway, will make them similarly available for sidings. However,
                        in view of the special accessibility of the eastern railway to arterial
                        street traffic and tramways, no necessity for such expansion is likely to
                        arise for a long while.</p>
                    <p>The public service plant for the production of power, electricity and gas,
                        which can be assured architectural consideration in the public interest, is
                        located in a separate but less unobtrusive land pocket on the railway route
                        and main industrial channel, and for efficiency it is given the advantage of
                        water frontage on the main canal.</p>
                    <p>ADMINISTRATION.- Commercial and professional offices, banks, and Chamber of
                        Commerce are specially favored in sites near the extremities of the business
                        axis, where there are special advantages in elevation and the attractions of
                        parks and public buildings, as well as lesser pressure of rent. The rings
                        around the Government offices are generally advantageous in these respects,
                        but the other end will be most accessible to the highest class residential
                        district, and probably preferable for the physicians and dentists.</p>
                    <p>GOVERNMENT.- For the combined governments of the district and the
                        municipality an area of 10 1/2 acres is reserved, crowning the central hill,
                        where these most important structures of the city will command the
                        commercial axis and dominate the vistas from every other direction.
                        Moreover, all the other public buildings and most conspicuous edifices of
                        the city are platted on the same system of parallels to contribute
                        additional elements to this architectural domination, definitely linked in
                        the simplest possible way.</p>
                    <p>The central group thus governing the public architecture of the town as well
                        as its affairs comprises the headquarters of the irrigation district, the
                        Town Hall, the court house, and subordinate public offices.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION - On Griffin's first arrival in Australia, before he had been made
                        director of the Federal Capital, Mr. Wade <note>L.A.B. Wade?</note>who was
                        in control of the Irrigation District asked him to design the capital of
                        this district - the city of Griffith.</p>
                    <p>The lay of the land made it possible to divert the irrigation canal from a
                        straight line to a semicircle for the Civic Center. Mr. Wade saw the
                        possibilities this offered and agreed.</p>
                    <p>It took many long arguments with the railroad people to get them to consent
                        to bring together the 3 Railroad systems. No occasion for it at present,
                        they said. But Griffin said that as the decades rolled on into centuries it
                        would be needed. "Oh, by that time the Japs will be here," they said. "Well
                        let's have it right for the Japs." He said. He won.</p>

                    <p>THE CITY PLAN OF GRIFFITH by Walter Burley Griffin<lb/> continued</p>
                    <bibl>Of this the editor of the Irrigation Record says</bibl>
                    <p>(The designer's conception of the city of Griffith as it should appear when
                        completely developed on the lines he has laid down is illustrated below. The
                        following notes may be an aid to the identification of the prominent
                        features of the bird's-eye view now given with the ground plan published in
                        the last issue.</p>
                    <p>No difficulty will be experienced in tracing the line of the main canal from
                        where it enters the urban area on the east and crosses the Wilbriggie
                        railway just north of the hotel center (A). The effect which will be
                        produced by its sweeping curve round the central portion of the city and by
                        the two enlargements of the waterway is very apparent.</p>
                    <p>Due north of the hotel center, the railway station (B) can be readily
                        distinguished, but the line of the railway from Barellan to Griffith is not
                        at all prominent. Further north again, and a little to the east of the
                        railway station, the block of academy buildings (C) makes another prominent
                        feature of the landscape. Following the western curve of the railway from
                        Wilbriggie, just after its junction with the Barellan line at the railway
                        station, the post office buildings (D) and markets can be picked out, and
                        still further to the left-hand side of the picture, right in the center of
                        the town, is possibly the most prominent landmark of all - the
                        administrative center (E). No doubt the years to come will see the Town Hall
                        flag waving gaily on many festive occasions. The theatre (F) does not show
                        out very distinctly, and the same is also true to a lesser extent of the
                        hospital (G). There is nothing of outstanding prominence in the
                        manufacturing and commercial area (H), and buildings of striking design have
                        not been shown for the agricultural show grounds (I), but in a reproduction
                        of such small dimensions it is impossible to illustrate adequately many of
                        the important features of the plan.</p>
                    <p>There can be no question as to the general effect of the artist's work, and a
                        Griffith stately and spacious as that foreseen would be a </p>

                    <p>worthy capital of the State's great irrigation scheme. - Editor.)</p>
                    <p>GRIFFITH -</p>
                    <p>EDUCATION.- Since the Capital of a large district will first of all attract
                        leading educational activities, a site of 16.48 acres is given the high
                        terminal point of the commercial axis opposite the government, where at the
                        outset, anyway, the public high school or academy group may be established
                        to be supplemented by contiguous parallel private institutions for which
                        flanking situations are reserved.</p>
                    <p>As the center combining recreation with educational motives, a site for a
                        Public Institute to house library, art gallery, museum and lecture halls is
                        indicated facing the Government group across the broad water and park from
                        the north-west direction. This important edifice might well be allied with
                        an agricultural college, whose experimentation plots occupying irrigated
                        land, would have unobstructed scope for extension toward the west without
                        necessity for intersection by or interruption with any internal traffic of
                        the city.</p>
                    <p>A more popular and general educational feature merging into recreational use
                        is the Exhibition Grounds, wherein race meetings may be held as well as the
                        annual agricultural and horticultural show. Such a site, because of its
                        merely occasional use, cannot be central, but in this case it is most
                        readily accessible by means of main traffic and tram routes on either side.
                        It occupies a hillock terminating another one of the radial avenues. This
                        mound of just appreciable rise is enough to greatly enhance the effect of a
                        show feature of the city, and the canal which abuts it for a distance of
                        almost half a mile will contribute a special attraction.</p>
                    <p>RECREATION.- The indicated 20 percent proportion of the site in public parks
                        by no means gives a true conception of the permanent wild reserve that will
                        be available to the residents for outing; the whole wooded rocky ridge
                        extending for miles being contiguous with the Ridge Park that lies within
                        the mile and a quarter radius. In fact, this range may be one of the
                        inducements to bring additional residents</p>
                    <pb n="14"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 14 ====]</p>
                    <p>to Griffith.</p>
                    <p>The next feature of the site that provides unique attractiveness is the main
                        canal, which flows around the administrative center in an arc. This channel,
                        with curving embankments with expanded ponds and water gardens, is the
                        enlivening natural element of the City Park for midday respite of the
                        sedentary workers and for continual promenade. A resplendent garden holds
                        inspiration for everyone, and an additional benefit if the attempt is made
                        to widely vary the examples of plants or animal life and indicate their
                        names and associations. Where handy like this one, it not only offers the
                        social rallying place and commons for all but invites general use for
                        concerts, festivals, and pageants, and affords youths opportunity for
                        competitive games and water sports.</p>
                    <p>Disposed in a belt on the lower side of the business area, this City Park
                        interposes but slight burden in distance on the communication to and from
                        the south-western and least valuable residential area, while the promenade
                        form stretching for a mile is capable of augmentation by five radially
                        connected series of local parks that lead directly into the open country,
                        and which, though intersected by short cross roads, are not disrupted by
                        heavy traffic, and will afford great scope for peaceful stroll and varied
                        explorations.</p>
                    <p>LOCAL PARKS.- These radial local parks, having only garden and not service
                        frontages in the surrounding houses, afford permanent "vacant allotments"
                        for youthful activities, and are so large and so numerous that excessive
                        concentration and consequent boisterous activities away from parental
                        control are not encouraged.</p>
                    <p>They are supplemented by corresponding smaller parks in alternate blocks
                        throughout the city, an arrangement which is optional in all the districts
                        of Griffith by reason of the typical block depth of 400 ft. to provide in
                        each locality for the diverse needs of various kinds of families as to
                        accommodation for children, for pleasure garden, or for horticulture, and
                        for individual preferences as to separate responsibility or neighborhood
                        co-operation in any of these directions.</p>

                    <p>Local schools as well as local associations and clubs, always, and often even
                        churches, are to be situated in contact with these many parks, to facilitate
                        not only their use but their supervision and the helpful direction of
                        children's activities, and as well, to supply handy housing for the general
                        accoutrements of the recreation field for all ages.</p>
                    <p>HABITATION</p>
                    <p>TRANSIENTS' CENTER.- The capital characteristics as well as the commercial
                        promise in addition to the Government policy of a single State hotel
                        dispensary for alcoholic drinks forecasts considerable concentration in an
                        hotel district which naturally should have the benefit of the main public
                        gardens and also be convenient to general business, and especially to the
                        railway station. These conditions are met in a subsidiary mound diverging
                        from the administration hill where two main avenues of approach cross the
                        southern railway line here conducted through a subway and free from
                        shunting. This transients' group is conspicuous in itself, and enjoys fine
                        prospects of public administration buildings and gardens, as well as the
                        privilege of two stretches of radially linked local parks.</p>
                    <p>Hotels of a residential type, as well as the hospital, are suitably located
                        on the public gardens, while for a Resort the ridge reserve offers an
                        unusual opportunity.</p>
                    <p>HOMES.- The "upper" and "lower" sides of town furnish distinctive advantages
                        for residents who may on the one hand prefer the height and views and the
                        generally closer allotments for most intimately sociable semi-urban living,
                        or on the other hand those who may desire to combine gardening or
                        semi-agricultural activities with suburban home life, merging gradually at
                        the outskirts into full-fledged farm units of 10 acres upwards.</p>
                    <p>Simple bungalow houses, ranged not in monotonous rows but grouped for the
                        effect of open courts to conserve air and views, are in general to be
                        allowed a minimum latitude of 50 ft. each and are to be set close upon the
                        minimum 100 ft. street building lines which mark the legal</p>
                    <pb n="16"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 16 ====]</p>
                    <p>highways but do not indicate the varying and generally much narrower actual
                        thoroughfares.</p>
                    <p>The point of vantage for the living quarters in such houses is the 200 ft.
                        minimum depth of lot or the alternative local enclosed park prospect
                        providing ample scope and privacy to garden fronts, secluded, free of
                        services and offices.</p>
                    <p>COMMUNICATION.- A proportion of nearly 30 percent reserved for communication
                        marks the characteristic of spaciousness for Griffith, but it indicates a
                        maximum far above the actual area that will be utilized for public
                        thoroughfares, since it includes highways everywhere provided with private
                        forecourts, also, since the legal widths fix only the front-building-line,
                        separation of structures.</p>
                    <p>ACCESS.- The ridge bounding the city on the north-east and the irrigated area
                        of intensive culture extending in the other directions determine that the
                        external communication lines be so laid down as to afford direct access from
                        east, south-east, south, south-west, and north-west.</p>
                    <p>The railway requiring minimum gradients, and through routing is kept entirely
                        on the level of the plain, but conforms in alignment with a corresponding
                        radial system of through roadways for the other sorts of heavy and
                        long-distance traffic connecting with the outlying country and nearest
                        important towns or centers already established. Barellan, to the north-west,
                        Wilbriggie due south, and Hillaton to the north-west, are the immediate
                        objectives of the railway lines, while all the existing important country
                        roads are made directly tributary to the existent highways which they join
                        at a distance of two miles from the focus.</p>
                    <p>For these roads, the maximum thoroughfare width of 150 ft. is allowed in each
                        case to accommodate interurban tramways, separate from the roadways, on a
                        wide central shaded promenade parking.</p>
                    <p>The main irrigation canal, whose location is definitely fixed by the
                        configuration of the slopes, is incorporated with highways to insure proper
                        supervision and to secure the greatest possible public benefit</p>
                    <pb n="17"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 17 ====]</p>
                    <p>from the water surface for appearance and for boating, for which latter
                        purpose and for bathing it is expanded in the public gardens.</p>
                    <p>CIRCULATION.- The arteries of internal traffic comprise the 150 ft. radiating
                        avenues, together with their cross connecting annular streets in the
                        business districts. Every opportunity that the undulations of the site
                        afford has been utilized to provide the necessary separate grade over the
                        railway thoroughfares, the natural slopes intersected by the latter being
                        sufficient to accommodate not only roadways but their attendant building
                        frontages, insuring a maximum of continuity and flexibility for commercial
                        development.</p>
                    <p>DISTRIBUTION.- All subsidiary streets have a minimum building line spacing of
                        100 ft. which allows for central parking where needed for tramway cross
                        connections or for distributing irrigation canals in addition to moderate
                        roadways. Option with the authorities is reserved as to the treatment of
                        individual streets, but the roads generally are intended to be occupied for
                        public use only to the extent of widths proportionate to their lengths and
                        positions in the city, thus conforming to the amount of traffic that may be
                        expected or that may develop. With the lengths and breadths reduced where
                        the least traffic is wanted, the additional depth thus made available for
                        the more out of the way of the uniformly plotted blocks, registers that
                        increasing proportion of private site to public ways which is natural.</p>

                    <p>BEYOND THE WEST</p>
                    <p>1915 - March - Greenwich, New South Wales - Dear Miss Franklin <note>Stella
                            (Miles) Franklin?</note>, We are breaking up our private partnership. Mr.
                        Clamp <note>J. Burcham Clamp</note> feels that with so large a percentage of
                        Mr. Griffin's time absorbed by Federal matters (out of the last ten months
                        he has given less than two to his private work) he is not reaping much
                        advantage from the partnership. We all feel that it is much better that it
                        should not continue. It is not to be expected that a chance partner should
                        have the burning devotion to Mr. Griffin's ideals that he and we uns have,
                        nor a willingness to work on the very long lines which leave financial
                        reward to the distant future.</p>
                    <p>As to the Federal Capital matters there are two possible solutions of the
                        very trying and we sometimes fear impossible situation. One is that the
                        Parliament and Ministers do not understand the motives of the Civil Service
                        which is determined to control everything itself without the embarrassment
                        of outside inspection of its methods or results, or that they feel helpless
                        to contend against the absolute autocracy of a body established for life
                        over which neither the people nor their political agents have any control
                        whatever and into whose hands the nation pours all its taxes for them to
                        spend entirely at their pleasure the result necessarily being that they care
                        nothing for the efficiency of the works they undertake but only for the
                        increasing of their own force and power. The other is that they are in
                        cahoots with them for of course there are to be tremendous contracts let or
                        expenditures made in the course of construction of the city. Both elements
                        may enter into the situation.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that in the ten months we have been here Walter has not been able
                        to accomplish a single thing. The Parliament House competition which he sent
                        out has been cancelled. He took infinite pains with that and one of the
                        European city planners who passed through this country at the time said that
                        if he never did another thing that alone was enough to establish his claim
                        on the gratitude of the</p>
                    <pb n="19"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 19 ====]</p>
                    <p>world - not only because of the ideals but because of the sane, rational
                        method it established, and because of the caliber of the work it would call
                        forth. We still hope that the mistake of calling it off can be remedied
                        although it will be very hard to reestablish the confidence of competitors,
                        or in the judges for whom, standing at the head of their profession, it
                        would be almost impossible to find alternates. The Civil Service is
                        determined to make its own program and make their own control complete.</p>
                    <p>As to the plan they have no notion of letting any plan but their own be
                        carried into execution and as they are in power for life they can gain their
                        ends, they hope, by delay piled on delay, working in a scheme of their own
                        whenever they get a chance as they have recently been trying to do by
                        proceeding with a sewerage system of their own, antiquated and wasteful,
                        throwing away money into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The present
                        Minister of Home Affairs <note>William Oliver Archibald</note> is by common
                        consent of his colleagues the least fitted for his position. He is entirely
                        a tool of the department, and has no intelligence to appeal to. The Prime
                        Minister <note>Andrew Fisher</note> up to the present has refused to allow
                        Mr. Griffin an interview. Is <note>He's?, It's?</note> apparently determined
                        not to let him state his case. Why we can only surmise.</p>
                    <p>The architects, especially of Melbourne, are jealous, and the people as a
                        whole, not comprehending the facts, are indifferent. Bit by bit Mr. Griffin
                        has awakened various individuals to the facts, and there are several men who
                        are doing what they can to help but it is mighty little they can do
                        apparently. Dr. Maloney <note>William Robert Nuttall Maloney?</note> a
                        member of Parliament since its first days is a staunch and untiring fighter
                        for the cause. It is time there was a muckraking campaign in Australia but
                        as yet Australians feel that it is their duty to conceal the defects of
                        their system. It of course makes them easy prey.</p>
                    <p>Our whole strength lies in the conspicuousness of the undertaking and hope of
                        a gradual realization of that fact by the Labor Party.</p>
                    <pb n="20"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 20 ====]</p>
                    <p>We are hoping the Party will realize before too late that the publication of
                        Mr. Griffin's correspondence with the Minister would lay them open to grave
                        suspicions, that the execution of the Department Plan would make them the
                        butt of the ridicule of the world, that their failure to fulfill the
                        government's contract with Mr. Griffin, with the International jury of
                        eminent architects, and with the competitors many of whom had done a lot of
                        work before cancellation, will seriously impair the nation's credit, that
                        the undertaking has such an appeal to the imagination that these things are
                        going to be talked and written about for a very long time to come. However
                        it is very difficult for them to get any comprehension of the general
                        interest. If the Labor Party fails to recognize this we are going to have to
                        depend on a gradual awakening of the Australian people which may take
                        decades.</p>
                    <p>I had such a charming hour with your Mother at her home a week ago. I am
                        afraid I got the uplift from her and she nothing from me but depression as
                        you see the tale I have to tell is not a pleasant one. But we all love
                        Australia and hope we can find a way to help.</p>

                    <p>1915 - March - Sydney.</p>
                    <p>Dear Robins <note>members of a round robin letter group of MMG's MIT
                            classmates</note>, Am doing so much writing of one kind or another that
                        I have taken to the type-writer. I know it will be a relief not to have to
                        puzzle over my writing. Though I am far from being an expert with the
                        machine it is very much easier than writing and, I think, faster even with
                        the short practice that I have had. It was a delight to get the Round Robin
                        and I am mailing it back on the boat it came on though this has been a busy
                        week for me, not that that is unusual, but I had to make a speech Thursday
                        to the Citizens' Association on Citizenship and Town Planning and as I could
                        not use lantern</p>

                    <p>slides because of ceiling lighting it had to be given some special attention.</p>
                    <p>I certainly could write a volume on this year's experience but that will have
                        to be postponed till later and be written perhaps for a larger audience.
                        There is a very strong anti-American feeling here for one aspect of which
                        Theodore Roosevelt is responsible in his pompous sending around the world of
                        the U.S. fleet with its flip assurance which of course he had no business to
                        make, that if Australia ever needed assistance the U.S. fleet would be on
                        hand to help. In fact the coming of the U.S. fleet was a large element in
                        starting them here on the battleship building fever and military movements
                        which are getting an appalling grip on the spirit of the people which, in
                        connection with a firmly entrenched bureaucracy over which the people have
                        absolutely no control, bids fair to strangle the development and prosperity
                        of the country for the next decade or two. There is no chance here for any
                        foreigner (and any new-comer is considered to be a foreigner) to prosper in
                        any field, trade or profession (except dentistry) and that is not only our
                        personal judgment but the universal opinion of those with whom we talk many
                        of whom have lived here some years. But is not only the freezing out of
                        strangers but a deliberate destruction of all the business of the country
                        for Socialism is being established here by both parties whether radical or
                        conservative and all its deadly consequences are in process.</p>
                    <p>It is a nation of pessimists full of fears; ideals are rarely to be found in
                        the country. All their policies are based on fear. Protective tariff is
                        doing its deadliest for as G.H. Perris (whose writings by the way you all
                        ought to read) says though a large country can stand the consequences of a
                        protective policy (the U.S. for instance being one of the biggest examples)
                        it will quickly strangle a small country. It certainly is strangling them
                        here where wages are very low compared to ours and the cost of living high.
                        There is bitter class feeling, the political parties being purely a class
                        division with no</p>
                    <pb n="23"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 23 ====]</p>
                    <p>difference of principles. As one liberal woman put it, "A liberal is one who
                        has, a laborite is one who hasn't." In private business no one trusts anyone
                        and we are finding they have good reason. You would be amazed if I should
                        tell you who made the following remark to us - "If I were in America I would
                        take more pains than I would here in making a contract, but when it was once
                        made I should feel confident that it would be fulfilled. Here I should know
                        that no attention would be paid to it."</p>
                    <p>My husband is having the fight of his life in the matter which brought us
                        over here and this is the remark reported to me by a lawyer, "I can't make
                        out what is the difficulty. It seems as if there must be something wrong."
                        "There certainly is," was the answer; "the whole Civil Service is rotten in
                        every Department." "Well but it seems to me that if Mr. Griffin had come
                        over here and drawn his salary and not fussed he would have got along all
                        right." "He certainly would," was the answer, "but he didn't come over here
                        to draw his salary but to do the work he was appointed to do and to do it
                        right," - and that's what we don't seem to be able to make any Australian
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>And that is a fact. Though the fight isn't over yet, we are still hopeful
                        that we have so far come in contact with the worst side and that soon the
                        better element will begin to manifest itself and help to start things going
                        right. There will have to be some signs of change soon or we shall feel
                        called upon to start a publicity campaign making an open statement of the
                        decidedly scandalous facts. The one word that describes the methods here is
                        inefficiency and the one that describes the ideals is mediocrity.</p>
                    <p>Now you mustn't think I am so pessimistic as this letter sounds. In fact I am
                        a confirmed optimist and am thinking that Australia may be on the verge of a
                        muck-raking period comparable to America's in the early 20th century in
                        which case changes may take place very rapidly. We may help the muck-raking
                        ball along. That may be quite as</p>
                    <pb n="24"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 24 ====]</p>
                    <p>useful a work as the one we were expecting to do. But one thing I must say.
                        Don't ever let them fool you into thinking that, in comparison, Americans
                        are a money loving people. The impression has arisen from the Americans'
                        open expression of contempt of those of their compatriots who have been led
                        by their desire of it, and from the many active measures that are being
                        taken in America to make it impossible for the unfair accumulation of money.
                        In European countries, and Australia is utterly European in its ideas, they
                        have never yet dreamed of questioning the manner of getting money. They
                        accept Special Privilege, which of course means unfairness, as a system
                        divinely right, and give unquestioning adoration to those who hold the
                        Privileges, envying of course but never questioning the propriety of the
                        System, trying when they do anything at all only, by any means whatever, to
                        get a privilege themselves.</p>
                    <p>There is not here a vestige of the feeling that it is a joy to work. No one
                        has enthusiasm in what he is doing. The interest is merely in getting the
                        money out of it. Of course we see that feeling in America, but here there is
                        nothing else. At any rate the attitude is so all but universal that it is
                        appalling, as is the feeling that one human being has a right to feel
                        superior to another and that superiority gives him the right to do anything
                        he wants to do to the inferior. The "ladies" are shocked if the servants
                        refuse as they themselves do to eat the dark meat of the fowl, and are
                        scandalized when they find the servant's family serves ham at home.
                        Fortunately my job as a draftsman made it unnecessary for me to participate
                        in society life.</p>
                    <p>The Australians find the Americans as inscrutable as the Chinese and I think
                        for the same reason, that they do not believe that might is right, they do
                        not believe in militarism nor imperialism. Two Australians, one a college
                        professor, made a curious remark to me. It is typical of the general point
                        of view and shows that they really</p>
                    <pb n="25"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 25 ====]</p>
                    <p>admire the German methods and are fighting them simply because they will grab
                        something they themselves want, something neither has a right to have.
                        Really the ideals of the two peoples are the same. There are individual
                        exceptions of course. The remark was - "Here is someone who doesn't believe
                        that the virility of a people is evidenced by its fighting tendency," -
                        meaning me. I was hooted at as being ridiculously silly. I said - "Do you
                        mean to say that you think that the Germans are proving their excellence and
                        virility by the fighting at the present time?" "Certainly, they are showing
                        what a splendid people they are." These were men who believed that Germany
                        had started the war. Well we rarely hear anything but vituperation of the
                        Germans at present but it is everywhere evident that the German ideal is the
                        general ideal. This was but the unusually frank expression of the common
                        ideal. In fact there is no such hatred of the Germans as there is of the
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p>The war has put a stop to our architectural work almost, but our community
                        work being on longer lines has not been seriously affected and we are very
                        busy as always even if we are not getting rich fast. Of course one of the
                        difficulties of our work is that we have to do so much of it ourselves, it
                        is very difficult to find anyone to whom we can delegate it. We have an able
                        assistant in Roy Lippincott who with his wife, Walt's sister Genevieve, is
                        here with us. Since the general conditions, which became apparent after we
                        had been here a few months, have made the future so uncertain we gave up the
                        idea of building a home until we could see more clearly, so our beautiful
                        lot in Vaucluse <note>a suburb of Sydney</note> is still unoccupied. We four
                        have been living in a cottage on another arm of the Harbor, right on the
                        water's edge, with a beautiful bank dropping terrace after terrace for some
                        80 feet, and at the bottom a swimming pool enclosed in concrete to keep the
                        sharks from eating us up - quite a necessary precaution. The only complaint
                        I make is that my husband has to</p>

                    <p>spend so much of his time in Melbourne. But he is with us week-ends. Our
                        being on the water makes it a real holiday for him and if any settlement
                        could be reached all his work, public as well as private, could be handled
                        from here. On clear days we get a glimpse of the Blue Mountains across the
                        water. Our yard has flowers in bloom all the year around and we get the full
                        benefit of the most gorgeous sunsets across the harbor looking up the waters
                        of Lane Cove. Bushels of love to you all, Marion</p>
                    <p>1916 - May - Melbourne - Dear Gene <note>Georgine Mahony Smith, MMG's
                        sister</note>, I hope Mother doesn't think she has to write me long letters
                        to make them worth while to me. Just a few sentences is enough to put me in
                        touch with you all and give me a homey feeling. In fact your letters are all
                        the home I have. Way back in Chicago Walter said to me he'd have to break me
                        of the homing habit. He insisted that I had broken him of the home habit and
                        that he'd have to do the same by me. Well I guess at last he has done it for
                        except for the purpose of going to bed I have no desire to go anywhere. The
                        office looks better than anything else to me. When Walter works at the
                        private office I go to sleep on the couch, when he has to work at the
                        Federal Office I stretch out on his desk and sleep there till he is ready to
                        go which is usually half past eleven or twelve. Then we trail home looking
                        like a couple of inebriates. Sometimes he sleeps on my shoulder, sometimes I
                        sleep on his.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes he keeps on with his work on the train and after he is in bed till
                        one or two o'clock. This is Sunday and I have been having afternoon tea with
                        some of the ladies at the home of Mrs. Paling - a very pleasant home but I
                        didn't want to go and two weeks from tonight I have another social
                        appointment. I can't get out of them but have no way of returning the
                        courtesy which adds to the trial. They always want him and he never can go
                        so it makes it as unpleasant as it used to be to have to go instead of you
                        where you were the one wanted. This having to play first fiddle roles when
                        you are only built for second</p>

                    <p>fiddle parts is terribly trying. If I only had never married Walt but had
                        just been his draftsman and had stuck to him in that capacity it would have
                        been so much better. I would have been saved so many complications. The only
                        difficulty would be that it might have added somewhat to his complications
                        and heaven knows he has enough.</p>
                    <p>During the coming week in addition to all his legitimate work he has to write
                        some volumes summarizing the evidence he had been giving the Works Committee
                        for the past year and replying to the evidence of other witnesses called in
                        on the questions of the Lakes of the Federal Capital and the Railroad and
                        the roads, etc. and much of their evidence is deliberately misrepresented by
                        a bunch of shysters who don't pay the slightest regard to truth in anything
                        they say. Naturally it makes it very hard to reply to. Parliament meets on
                        Wednesday and there are a dozen things he has to get ready for presentation
                        to them. However we are hopeful that something may come of it.</p>
                    <p>The only thing I take any interest in doing is the work and I keep at it long
                        after I have a curl in my back bone, and am sick with fatigue. I don't know
                        what will become of me unless some of you folks come over to play with me.
                        It's a queer kind of life Walter and I are living full of a kind of
                        satisfaction but altogether too intense but with all its strenuousness there
                        is a peace of soul which after all is all that is necessary. The currents we
                        are pulling against have not yet proved too strong for us and we'll paddle
                        on as long as we can. I have a notion we're helping to clear a way through
                        the jungle but Lord how the beasts do snap and bite.</p>
                    <p>At present I am doing mostly listing of native plants for planting now for
                        both private work and the Federal Capital. I ought to be at it now but guess
                        I'll go stretch on Walter's desk and go to sleep instead. Love Marion.</p>

                    <p>Newman College, one of Griffin's first private jobs, is planned to make use
                        of the whole street frontage of the Catholics' terraced property. The Chapel
                        as shown will be in the center and the part already constructed will be
                        duplicated on the other half of the property. A dome building - the ultimate
                        library - will be on the street corner and the two dormitory wings with
                        their terminal specialized buildings will complete the enclosing of the
                        interior court.</p>
                    <p>The word "College" does not mean what it does in America. It means a
                        dormitory building for students. This group however included in addition to
                        dormitories and dining Hall not only a building for sports for the students,
                        gymnasium, swimming pool, etc. but another building, architecturally
                        identical, with laboratories, etc., for supplementing the university
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>These two buildings terminate the two stretches of student dormitories which
                        extend at right angles to each other from the dining hall dome.</p>
                    <p>The whole of this is to be duplicated when its dome will become the Library.
                        Then a chapel will be entered from between the two groups its forecourt
                        flanked by the two scientific buildings, connected by a chapel cloister.</p>

                    <p>1916 - March - Melbourne - Dear Mother, Thursday the contract was signed for
                        the Catholic College of the Melbourne University. So that is one definite
                        thing accomplished. The contract is £51,000 and Walter feels that the
                        contractor is a capable and energetic man so we hope things will go
                        smoothly. All the conditions of the chief donor have been met so he will
                        have a hard time to make trouble though he may. His chief objection was to
                        having modern plumbing replace the time honored "thunder mug."</p>
                    <p>Our "friends," the trio, are no doubt gnashing their teeth, their really
                        strenuous efforts having come to naught. They are trifling people, as Mrs.
                        Holman (wife of the New South Wales Prime Minister) said, and so apparently
                        malicious that if they have any effect it is the opposite of their
                        intentions. Gene <note>Georgine Mahony Smith</note> doesn't seem to be
                        appealed to by Australia and of course I fully understand her feeling. But
                        that doesn't mean</p>

                    <p>that you all would not enjoy a good old 4 months holiday over here. Last
                        Thursday Walt went to his College Committee meeting at five and I snoozed on
                        the couch till eight when he came back with the good news. We had all been
                        on tenterhooks for several weeks, the Committee and all fearing war prices
                        might make the costs prohibitive so when he came we danced a jig and said
                        let's go to a picture show. Then ensued a discussion as to whether we should
                        go to a show or be rational and get something to eat. We finally decided to
                        be sensible for once and went to a China shop and had our favorite Ki Si
                        Min. Finished at nine so we went to a movie too. Hit a fairly good one so we
                        felt we had spreed it satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>We had to send for Roy <note>Lippincott</note> to come down here to Melbourne
                        so Genevieve is the lonesome one this week. Miss Benke stays nights when Roy
                        is away so she is not really alone. We all wish Mother Griffin could have
                        stayed two or three weeks longer even if Father did have to go home to his
                        business. I think they really enjoyed their visit though it was a shame we
                        could not all have been together more of the time. But then baby Alstan
                            <note>Genevieve and Roy's child</note> was the most important one to be
                        with. Walt is working away in the next room. It's ten o'clock. Think I'll
                        have be go put a stop to his nonsense shortly. I don't know what he would do
                        if he didn't have me to pester him. He never recognizes a stopping place by
                        himself. Good night sweet mother.</p>

                    <p>THE CAPITOL THEATRE - MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.<lb/> WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN -
                        ARCHITECT</p>
                    <p>When it came to the Capitol Theatre in the heart of Melbourne, he was up
                        against as difficult a situation as could face an architect, not only the
                        bureaucracy but three different owners (one absentee, difficulty of dealing
                        with an agent) none with a grain of aesthetic inclination. They all knew
                        that to build a first class theatre they must maintain a certain standard
                        but hated to spend a penny they could get out of. So there was another long
                        fight - the Capitol as well as the Capital. In every case he had to put in a
                        drawing of the ordinary thing and get a price on it. Then put in his own
                        conception, beautiful, the price of which would be less than the ordinary
                        thing so from their own standards they had to accept it.</p>
                    <p>There is still nothing comparable to it in the world. There has been much
                        talk about interior illumination of theatres but here it is done on a grand
                        scale, a stepped, oblong pyramidal ceiling, thousands of different colored
                        lamps hidden by the beam steps and the light thrown up on intensely rich and
                        deeply cut crystalline pattern, cuttings sometimes three feet deep so that,
                        played as a color organ, it glows from alabaster white to rainbow colors in
                        endless combinations and rich with shades and shadows, a mysterious
                        loveliness and a powerful grandeur. As one architect expressed it, he could
                        sit and watch that ceiling for a fortnight and when he came away he would
                        not be able to draw it. The Paramount people at the opening said if it were
                        built in New York it would be packed continually without their having to
                        give any shows. By means of an electric switchboard this color organ is
                        played for a half hour before each performance as well as in the
                        intermissions.</p>
                    <p>When the question was brought up by the Council of a roof ten stories above
                        the street which projected a few feet beyond the building line Griffin put
                        in another design with stepped piers running up above the roof, the center
                        one the highest, and the others stepping down, all extending back giving a
                        feeling of a substantial third</p>

                    <p>The shape of the property necessitated a very long and narrow building
                        determining many unusual treatments in construction and design. It gave the
                        opportunity for grand entrance treatments, sumptuous foyer with its
                        balconette, and a unique and mysteriously beautiful ceiling and lighting
                        treatment.</p>

                        City Iowa, in that case not the piers but the keystones over the openings.
                        His co-architect who according to the contract was to have no participation
                        in design, construction nor superintendence, advised against this design.
                        The first design was carried through. Later a building was constructed to
                        this alternative design in Melbourne. For some years this markedly striking
                        design appeared in many city buildings, <note>the words "Melbourne, Sydney"
                            have been erased</note> and when I went to India some years later the
                        first tall building I saw under construction - in Madras - was this design.
                        In this case it was charmingly and delicately handled. When I came back to
                        the United States I found it in general use in bridges, etc. and in the most
                        beautiful building of the New York Fair - the Russian Building. Truly a
                        design once conceived persists in the etheric realm and becomes accessible
                        to imaginative thinkers. We were always glad to see the senor's <note>Walter
                            Burley Griffin's</note> work having so swift an influence on his time,
                        only too slow for us. We could only wish that more builders took the trouble
                        to train themselves to enter these realms in full consciousness and bring
                        back treasures of beauty to be built into the world of manifestation. Anyway
                        it was a joy to know that such creative work as constantly dropped from
                        Griffin's pencil would have its influence in molding our civilization to
                        beauty as our people trained themselves to loftier concepts than mere
                        security; and as they learned the simple lesson of organizing their
                        communities on lines that bring health instead of inevitable disease.</p>
                    <p>THE FIRST "SKYSCRAPER" IN AUSTRALIA.- THE CAPITOL, MELBOURNE.</p>
                    <p>The Capitol, built in 1924 is 10 stories high and made history in many ways
                        in Australia. During the following quarter of a century tall buildings
                        approaching America's have been built in Sydney but only at the end of that
                        time have they begun to appear in Melbourne. In the Melbourne Herald of
                        1943, Lieutenant Carrara [Note: Arthur A. Carrara?], graduate of Architecture of the University of
                        Illinois, in addressing the conference on Town Planning, is quoted by the
                        Melbourne Herald as saying:- Melbourne has only two buildings that merit

                        architects fail to see how well Mr. Griffin carried out his theme."</p>
                    <p>In <bibl>1924 the Melbourne Herald</bibl> in publishing the above photograph
                        so said:- A WONDERFUL BUILDING - In the midst of the celebrated Howie Estate
                        in Swanston Street, a colossal structure of steel frame and concrete has
                        lately been stripped of scaffolding and stands now revealed to thousands
                        daily passing as a noble architectural feature set in the heart of the city.
                        The New Building is to be known as "The Capitol." It will contain a
                        remarkable picture theatre, surrounded by shops and surmounted by offices,
                        housing, it is believed, the elite of the business enterprise of the
                        metropolis.</p>
                    <p>The entrance hall visible from the street is broken by a low flight of
                        semi-circular marble steps leading to a broad landing, and is ceiled with
                        ornamented shallow gilt domes brilliantly lighted. Straight forward a broad
                        arch leads to the floor of the house while, at the right of this, horse-shoe
                        arches open on the stairways to the foyer and dress circle. An array of
                        stout pillars in arabesque design supports a low roof heavily girdered in
                        white coated concrete. The stairway walls are carved at the landings in
                        consonance with the geometric design of the whole entrance hall. The motif
                        of the design, deeply carved with arabesques, suggests something of
                        mysteries beyond, which the moving picture men will no doubt endeavor to
                        live up to. Upstairs the foyer surrounds a balustraded light area from the
                        floor of which people will be able to look down upon the assembling crowds
                        in the auditorium.</p>
                    <p>Unusual stability and tensile strength characterizes the whole building and
                        some remarkable expedients in structural engineering have been introduced.
                        To keep the theatre and gallery free from columns an immense steel girder
                        spans the theatre entrance and carries the</p>

                    <p>To maintain face with their London client a second architect shared the
                        commission with Griffin on this building. In the course of meeting the
                        opposition of the Town Hall Griffin submitted alternative designs for the
                        facade, stepped plinths rising above the roof with molding as shown here or
                        stepped piers between the windows. Shortly after this his "silent" partner
                        used the latter design in a building in Melbourne. The idea has swept around
                        the world - in buildings, bridges, etc. It appeared nobly in the Russian
                        Building in New York World's Fair and most charmingly in Madras, India.</p>

                    <p>The awning is a noteworthy piece of engineering construction, weighing
                        approximately 25 tons, built on the cantilever principle, of reinforced
                        concrete and structural steel. Reinforced concrete is the material used by
                        the architect in the construction of the whole building, the first in
                        Australia.</p>
                    <p>One of the most remarkable structural features are the escape staircases, all
                        completely isolated in concrete. These descend on both sides of the theatre.
                        (Comment by M.M.G. - These escape stairs accomplished the impossible task of
                        two objects occupying the same space at the same time. Each was a double
                        flight and in both cases neither of the two flights had any connection with
                        the other. They were entered from various levels of the unusually deep
                        balcony. The Municipal Council couldn't believe it was possible so a model
                        was made to prove it. The supervisors of construction tried later to change
                        certain flights here or there but found they couldn't change a single step.
                        Though that was W.B.G.'s concept and requirement it was M.M.G.'s patience
                        that worked it out as built.)</p>

                    <p>TEXT - The following text is quoted from the Tenth Anniversary Souvenir of
                        The Capitol Theatre.</p>
                    <p>THE THEATRE AS AN INSTITUTION - Ten years ago, on November 8th, 1924, a
                        theatre opened its doors that cherished an ideal - an ideal that was
                        institutional in its inspiration; An ideal to give to the citizens of
                        Melbourne and Australia in general a theatre that could be justly termed, by
                        its achievements and its records, a National Institution. Commencing with
                        The Ten Commandments, the Capitol Theatre began its history in a blaze of
                        glory. A standard in entertainment was inaugurated that definitely set a
                        standard not only for Australia but for deluxe cinema houses all over the
                        world.</p>

                    <p>Operatic and at the present time are featuring the trend in music toward
                        modernism. We trust we may be forgiven for quoting those famous words of
                        Addison:- "It is not in mortals to command success but we'll do more,
                        Sempronius - deserve it."</p>
                    <p>Not only is our pride in the entertainment but likewise in the theatre
                        itself. The unusual architecture and decorations even after ten years can
                        still vie with any theatre in the world today. It has defied the passage of
                        years. It is as modern in its appointments, its comforts and its
                        architecture as though it was at its First Anniversary instead of its Tenth.
                        Truly it is still the showplace of Melbourne, the world's most unusual
                        theatre.</p>
                    <p>Architectural forms never before attempted were blended with a color scheme
                        of bronze and gold, and the unique lighting effects, completely indirect,
                        were enlisted to produce a perfect palace for the motion pictures. Columns,
                        arches and arabesques of surpassing beauty gather the vision of all
                        audiences to the brilliant proscenium. The lofty fretted ceiling glows and
                        pulsates with all the splendor of the Aurora, amid the mystic architectural
                        forms of this theatre magnificent slowly dawns on the observers the daring
                        conception of the designer - a picture playhouse where music, form and color
                        conspire in a complete captivation of the senses.</p>
                    <p>Most buildings are describable by reference to the architectural style to
                        which they belong. Not so the Capitol. The theory of the designer was far
                        adrift from all the five orders. It was boldly declared that the
                        conventional forms of pillar, arch, architrave and pediment, with all their
                        developed beauty, sprang from the Stone Age; and that modern material, steel
                        and concrete, had no dependence on these time honored bases of stability.
                        Concrete in its plastic state can be molded to any fancy; in its final
                        setting, reinforced with steel, it is stronger than granite.</p>
                    <p>So, in the Capitol Theatre, we have wide floors and balconies depended on
                        their own tensile strength, and the very roof of the</p>

                        commercial offices overhead. The pillars in the foyers are not fluted and
                        tapered on the classical sculptured models but are modeled in cement with
                        quaint diapered designs that compel admiration by their originality. Even
                        the cornices have been left without the conventional moldings, and are
                        outlined in strips of varying light from hidden lamps.</p>
                    <p>A Color Symphony - The magnificent roof span of the theatre gave the designer
                        full range for a fanciful effect, and audiences find their attention
                        captured by the unique design of the walls and ceiling. Since there is a
                        complete absence of pillars the designer applied his imagination to the
                        novel decorations on the walls and ceiling, and not a square inch has been
                        allowed to escape. The side walls are buttressed by arrays of square-cut
                        supports, and above these the walls break into the ceiling in cubes,
                        triangles and stalactites of fretted plaster. Everywhere the straight line
                        prevails. The curves and moldings of conventional design are entirely
                        absent. The ceiling itself, over the central stalls, breaks up into a great
                        height in serrated lines of fretted plaster, all broken into little cubicles
                        upon which thousands of unseen globes pour artificial light in a myriad of
                        varied hues. The light effects are changeable at a touch and a skilled
                        operator is able to play them like a color symphony.</p>
                    <p>THE WIZARDRY OF A SYMPHONY IN COLORS - The quaint and strictly original idea
                        of the interior decoration of the Capitol Theatre is one not yet duplicated
                        or conceived by any other architect in the world. The architect, Mr. Walter
                        Burley Griffin, with his peculiar and unique genius performed wonders with
                        concrete and fibrous plaster that are truly astonishing. The remarkable
                        architectural feature is the array of beautiful alabaster prisms constructed
                        about the ceiling and side walls of the auditorium. The structure of these
                        features was an art in itself. Each block of prisms had to be exactly molded
                        and securely installed in the proper positions so as to bring out the</p>

                    <p>beautiful shades and coloring of the indirect lighting effects.</p>
                    <p>Seen in ordinary electric light the impression is of being in a colossal cave
                        cut and chiseled by skilled hands at the order of a cool, competent but
                        inspired brain. A thousand projections like trimmed horizontal stalactites,
                        thrust out symmetrically from the sides and the roof. Each speaks for the
                        design and all speak in unison so that a chorus of units each like a
                        regularized rock-crystal makes a mighty, architectural chorus.</p>
                    <p>One gets an impression similar to that received when watching that chemical
                        miracle of the formation of crystals except that here a particularly
                        appropriate form has been decided on and fixed in concrete form. That a man
                        could conceive such an idea, so aloof from the orthodox and standard
                        architectural canons, is a matter of utter astonishment and admiration.
                        There is a suggestion in the architecture of liquefied stone having been
                        thrown up in successive rectangular jets and congealed when and where the
                        architect's vivid imagination decreed geometric formation. Yet so consistent
                        and deliberate is the whole scheme that one comes to the conclusion that its
                        madness has a lot of calculation in it. These solid forms are not shaped as
                        prisms or faceted for fun, but more like gems by a giant lapidary. Something
                        serious is behind it all. This becomes evident when the lights are turned
                        on. At the back of the stage is a monster electric switchboard. To the
                        layman it is a mystery. Handles unlimited, numbered and colored tell the
                        initiated what they are capable of.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Frank Cunningham is the wizard of this keyboard. He has manipulated and
                        worked out thousands of color combinations which he has used in the past ten
                        years. By working the various handles he is able to suffuse the crystallized
                        ceiling in all the rosiness of the Aurora Borealis. His combinations are as
                        illimitable as those of the kaleidoscope. With his ability to operate the
                        lamps in the colors of red, green and violet he can make as many chromatic
                        variations as there are in prismatic glows. Yet not a light is to be seen.

                    <p>that all are concealed behind the concrete shelves which separate the stepped
                        prisms, and nothing but indirect light reaches the eye of the audience.</p>
                    <p>Each of the prisms is built on the principle of mirrors and each reflects on
                        to their neighbors the original light. With each later reflection the
                        intensity of light decreases, but this it is that gives gradation to the
                        colors and aids in the blending and the changing from one color to another.
                        There is no other architecture or lighting scheme like it in the world. It
                        is the work of a genius in resource and an artist in effects. In the past
                        ten years the beauty of these effects had left a memorable admiration on
                        every patron of the theatre. Today this wizardry of lighting and elaborate
                        decoration is as modern and unique as any of the present day architecture.</p>
                    <p>THE MAIN ENTRANCE LOBBY.- Entering the theatre from Swanston Street the
                        curious and heavily gilded ticket boxes attract attention immediately. Most
                        original in design and construction they are decorated entirely in cubes and
                        squares of bronze, plaster and metal, these decorations forming frames for
                        the large sheets of grained glass which serve as walls to the boxes. Behind
                        the glass, gold leaf is heavily applied. The huge glass chandelier hanging
                        from the roof above the main box-office adds to the brilliance and
                        decorative scheme of the front lobby.</p>
                    <p>The entrance foyer, visible from the street, is broken by a low broad flight
                        of semicircular stairs leading to a broad landing and carpeted in rich tones
                        of orange and apricot with curious arrowheads of black and green, designed
                        by Griffin and woven in London. The landing is ceilinged with ornamented
                        plaster and shallow gilt domes brilliantly lighted. Straight forward a broad
                        arch leads to the floor of the house while, right and left of this horseshoe
                        arches open to the stairways to the foyer and dress circle.</p>

                    <p>roof, heavily girded in cream-coated concrete. The stairway walls are curved
                        at the landings in consonance with the geometric design of the whole
                        entrance lobby. The motif of the design, deeply carved with arabesque
                        suggests something of the mysteries beyond.</p>
                    <p>EXOTIC BUT CAPTIVATING.- Upstairs on the first floor is the dress circle
                        foyer and lounge dignified and richly furnished in a harmonious note of
                        gaiety. Covering the vast foyer, the lush Wilton carpets were specially
                        designed to harmonize with the color and decorative scheme of the whole
                        theatre. Ivory, sandstone and bronze - these are the three main motives of
                        the color scheme of the interior decorations. Ivory for the various
                        ceilings, sandstone for the walls, pillars and stairways, and bronze for all
                        metal-work, railings and portions of the colorings which pick out the
                        interstices in the plaster ornamentations. This combination, in addition to
                        the brilliant orange and green carpetings, seems strangely bizarre but
                        actually the colorings harmonize remarkably and offset well the Aztec like
                        cubes and squares which serve as bases for the structural decorations.</p>
                    <p>FOYER - THE MURAL DECORATION.- The height of the ceiling gives an impression
                        of coolness which impression is increased by the ivory color and the vast
                        area. A cool theatre and a restful one were primary aims in the interior
                        decoration. Indeed color effects throughout were watched very closely and
                        skillfully. Almost as impressive as the ceiling are the giant sandstone
                        pillars in the foyer. Light sienna in tone, they are multisided with the
                        tops and bases relieved by broad dual shoulders painted in brown and bronze.
                        Let into the faces of these pillars are risen squares of plaster, the spaces
                        between the squares being decorated in gold leaf.</p>
                    <p>The stairs bring one to the fireplace end of the foyer. On the long side
                        across the well looking down into the auditorium below is a mural decoration
                        of Australian forestry which is ideal in form and coloring for decorative
                        purposes. Above we see the front rail of the Balconette. The mural was
                        painted by Mr. Nicholls of Melbourne.</p>

                    <p>THE BALCONETTE - THE SMOKE ROOM.- One can reach the different levels of the
                        balcony of the auditorium from the entrance which leads from the fireplace
                        end of the Foyer or from the stairs opposite whose first run leads off to
                        the Balconette, or smoking Room, secluded yet not secluded and well
                        ventilated. It is like a gorgeous and luxuriant living room, apart from yet
                        a part of the great foyer.</p>
                    <p>PROSCENIUM AND ORGAN.- The motifs of the elongated pyramid of the Auditorium
                        ceiling are carried down in the proscenium arch whose main form is
                        determined by the forms of the units. These surfaces in the ceiling are
                        built up of crystalline forms cut from depths of a few inches to a depth of
                        three feet giving endless reflections from surface to surface quite
                        indescribably lovely. These forms of the ceiling steps are carried down in
                        the Proscenium where enough of their more hidden surfaces are open for sound
                        transmission. The organ pipes are concealed on both sides and the sound
                        pours out from the center. The proscenium is illuminated as is the ceiling
                        from concealed lamps so that any color can be played as a whole or in any
                        part in any combination. Since the whole of the material world is made up
                        from the battle between light and sound - the form-building forces - these
                        two can touch all the strings of human nature for the temperaments too -
                        choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic and melancholic are determined by a
                        preponderance of one or another of these forces, red, yellow, blue, lilac -
                        creating warmth, light, sound &amp; magnetism.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In Australia, 25 years ago, in 1914, one might say one saw Europe in the
                        final stages resulting from the disease of bureaucracy. This is evidenced in
                        the hopeless ugliness of everything done by man, in the antipathy to and
                        fear of beauty.</p>
                    <p>The first step in the construction of Canberra was taken, before the plan of
                        the city had been made, in establishing the Military Quarters - Duntroon.
                        The designer had to accept its location as one of the external facts to be
                        faced. Empty spaces for hundreds of miles around but every pains taken to
                        make it a slum - narrow streets (very narrow as in Europe) with shanty
                        houses jammed together. Always in these ways the Civil Servants keep up the
                        pretense of economizing in the expenditure of tax money and always the costs
                        are enormously greater than they need be, and always it establishes
                        conditions which tend to maintain classes.</p>
                    <p>This urge to maintain classes is still evidenced in Canberra (1940) by the
                        requirement that officials build their homes in particular suburbs according
                        to their salaries. This is not a law but if, as occasionally happens, a man
                        builds in a suburb for lower salaried officials his chances for promotion
                        become small indeed. In the early years the majority of citizens are certain
                        to be Civil or Military officials.</p>
                    <p>They put through the construction of the Cotter dam some 40 feet high
                        supposed to be necessary for the city water supply but as the Royal
                        Commission made clear later, a 10 foot dam of the upper Molonglo River was
                        all that was necessary and would at the same time have maintained the series
                        of lakes within the city in those river bottoms which cannot be used for
                        anything else for each year they are flooded by the rains. For years the
                        officials built the Canberra Railroad on these nice flats and, each year
                        after the floods, built them over again. One hopes this dam will not follow
                        the example of the great Murrimbidge <note>Murrumbidgee?</note> dam of the
                        irrigation district, also built by the Civil Service</p>
                    <pb n="42"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 42 ====]</p>
                    <p>(as practically everything in Australia is) which is so cracked that the
                        water level has had to be lowered a third of the height. No one knows where
                        it will go next. A pleasant prospect for those below. A Scandinavian
                        engineer has been consulted who says the method of construction is faulty
                        but when I saw it a short time ago the water was still dammed up. Well the
                        irrigation districts are dependent on it so one can but live in hope they
                        won't all be drowned. Anyway the building of another is all to the good from
                        the Civil Service point of view.</p>
                    <p>We must remember that bureaucratic works cannot be judged by newly
                        established experiments such as are being tried in the U.S. in the taking
                        over by the government of public utilities, for example, for the men trained
                        in private enterprise are taken over, men accustomed to efficiency without
                        which private undertakings cannot continue to exist. The problem of these
                        great enterprises can be properly solved only when our communities add a
                        national Economic Organization to their Political one to be extended to a
                        World Organization if we want peace in the world. As for the Civil Service,
                        inefficiency is de rigueur, for inefficiency can always be made up out of
                        taxation where it is usually not obvious because of lack of competition and
                        where all advantage derives from inefficiency for through it the personnel
                        is increased, the department strengthened and renown achieved through the
                        fact of having spent great sums.</p>
                    <p>In Canberra it meant nothing to the officials that the bridge they built
                        across the Molonglo was washed away the next season. They built another.
                        They finally got into trouble about it only because the Canberra plan had
                        been gazetted which meant no change could be made in it without an act of
                        Parliament, and the dragon-eyed Mr. Smith <note>James Alexander
                        Smith?</note> got questions asked in Parliament as to who had been
                        authorized to change the levels established by the designer.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 ====]</p>
                    <p>But why should it care what people think or know or say. Thus with
                        transportation. As you travel over the mountains going from Sydney to
                        Melbourne you look down below to the old wagon road making the crossing at a
                        much better grade. Quite deliberately Governments choose the wrong way
                        first. People gradually realize that another way is better so it becomes
                        easy to scrap the old and build another, thus maintaining their force, still
                        not choosing the right way if it can be avoided as in the case of the
                        Railway to Canberra where in connection with the Arsenal City he was
                        designing in the Federal District Griffin connected it with Sydney with a
                        comfortable gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old one
                        thus keeping the way open for another tear down and rebuild.</p>
                    <p>Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the Railroads in the
                        control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America
                        shows the consequences, for individual initiative has brought continental
                        development in the United States. The Railroads have been undertaken and
                        pushed far and wide, ahead of and encouraging settlement and development.
                        The governmental control in Australia has made that impossible from the
                        beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escape from a system
                        firmly established where the preponderating vote of the population of the
                        present cities now makes it always to the advantage of the politician to
                        cater to the apparent urban interests and votes, and not "waste" their money
                        on wild Railroads built out into empty spaces.</p>
                    <p>As Professor Meyers <note>Hugo Richard Meyer?</note> says, the history of
                        Australia is the history of its Railroads. So on the whole the Railroads are

                        interior of the continent empty (not because it is a desert which it isn't)
                        constantly frustrating any hopes or plans of increasing the population of

                    <p>liaison between politics and economics through the establishment of a
                        Threefold Commonwealth. This is the more difficult perhaps because in
                        Australia the Labor Party is by no means a Labor Party but an industrial
                        Organization whose interests are with the manufacturing elements as versus
                        the primary producers. From another angle, Mr. Valentine, an official in the
                        railway department but one of those whose mentality had not been perverted
                        through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally owned and
                        privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a definite time
                        requires 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the government owned
                        railroad it takes two hundred and forty seven. Our own experiences would
                        lead us to take this as a typical example in the expense to a community of
                        the Bureaucratic method. This does not mean that such undertakings should be
                        handed over to individuals indiscriminately nor as monopolies but calls for
                        a Political Organ that strictly maintains Equity and not Privilege.</p>
                    <p>An electrical engineer in chinning <note>i.e., talking, chatting</note> with
                        Griffin on their personal experiences told the following tale:- As sometimes
                        happens, though rarely, he had been called in from outside to take charge of
                        the undergrounding of the electric wires of the district of Sydney. As the
                        work approached completion he called the attention of his superior officer
                        to the necessity of placing the men in some other work as it was de rigueur
                        not to dismiss civil servants. The chief not wanting to bother told him to
                        find something for them to do. He replied that he couldn't and got the
                        answer - "Well then tear out the work and do it over again." We have been
                        informed that Chicago's drainage canal was dug in the daytime and filled at
                        night, but however that may be bureaucracy in the economic realm is sure to
                        end that way.</p>
                    <p>Of course in Australia there is always the added pressure from England's
                        wanting to lend money and never wanting the principle to be returned. In the
                        tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable miserable things
                        imaginable. In Melbourne they ran the buses off the</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 46 ====]</p>
                    <p>streets by increasing the taxation. In Sydney the case was worse yet for with
                        the often very steep slopes the grinding noise of the cable-drawn trams is
                        unendurable and the old board seats intolerable. The buses on the whole
                        simply supplemented the trams in districts where the trams were often miles
                        away. For why should a bureaucracy bother to meet the needs of a community?
                        Much better hold back as much of the income as possible for munition makers
                        and other pals who will help pull off a war any time England wants one as it
                        does every time an economic rival appears on the scene.</p>
                    <p>The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to the curbs for
                        passengers). When the tramways began the fight against them they offered to
                        buy the tramways and pay off the whole indebtedness in fifteen years, but
                        no, the government bit by bit increased the tax till they could no longer
                        meet expenses and had to quit. The years roll on with no decrease in the
                        heavy rates. With increasing demands for buses they put on a few but first
                        seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old trams with new
                        heavily built ones, still uncomfortable, noisy and dangerous but enabling
                        them to spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable up and
                        down hill transportation for Sydney - the buses.</p>
                    <p>Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and
                        urgently required service helps to maintain the "morale," helps keep the
                        people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in
                        the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in
                        Australia, but it keeps people busy and feeling important. I thought a
                        pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the
                        women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part of
                        their efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in
                        something they had at heart which seemed a shocking thing to me who had been
                        accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for</p>

                        buses can be found in Section II, No. 17, pages 265b-265d (below).</note>

                    <p>any sort of charity or for assistance in any personal undertakings. I am
                        sorry that I can no longer say that of my country for in this as in so many
                        things America is beginning to try all the things that have been done in
                        Europe all of which are failures.</p>
                    <p>I listened to a lecture by Dr. Mary Booth urging the deputizing of the
                        government to get financial aid for a health clinic for mothers separate
                        from the clinic where sick children were brought. I went up to her afterward
                        saying it would seem impossible for the government to supply money and then
                        hand over the control of it to outsiders which was what they wanted, and
                        asked why they didn't collect the money and carry out this work privately
                        citing the work of that nature, hospitals, etc., in America that were
                        supported by private contributions. Her answer was that America was richer
                        than Australia. But, I said, Sydney is just as rich as New Orleans;
                        Melbourne is as rich as many cities in America. They did this. But no! It
                        wasn't to be considered for a moment. This is but one of the many ways of
                        pauperizing Australia. I spoke of it so in a letter to my brother that first
                        year in Australia and was called up by the police about it and had it not
                        been that the U.S. was not yet in the war, I should in all likelihood have
                        been put in jail for it as they quoted their authority for such a step which
                        would have been applied if America had been allied with the world powers.</p>
                    <p>Once established the Bureaucracy is ruthless. It is all-powerful. Why should
                        it care what people think or know or say. England is an example. The oldest
                        sons of the aristocracy form the House of Lords, the younger sons fill the
                        offices of the bureaucracy which has complete control of the House of
                        Parliament. So the aristocracy owns the government. Neat isn't it? The
                        general run of the people have no way of finding this out.</p>
                    <p>The Sydney bridge is another instance. It was let to a British contractor who
                        was not the lowest bidder. It should have been a sus-</p>
                    <pb n="48"/>

                    <p>pension bridge instead of a cantilever, aside from the practical advantages,
                        for the whole of this bridge depends on the strength of four pins only some
                        ten inches in diameter necessary to take up movement. As it is, it is most
                        unsightly and destroys the beauty of Sydney's Harbor by its scale as well as
                        its intrinsic ugliness. But really there should have been a tunnel instead.
                        Everything was right for a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic.
                        From a military point of view it should have been a tunnel. And shortly they
                        will have to build a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic. But then
                        the government, on principle, does the wrong way first. From the British
                        Empire they receive their titles for this. Just so much more money to be
                        lent as well as fat jobs for Britishers. The first bombers of an enemy would
                        strike this tempting target and that would block up the whole channel above
                        which lies Cockatoo Island, the naval and armament works. Many of the
                        structures built are too high to go under the bridge. Of course that's just
                        what the government wants so now they are destroying another of Sydney's
                        beautiful promontories gradually moving the whole of the Cockatoo Island
                        factories, etc., over to Clifton Gardens. Of course they were a fine target
                        for the Japanese there if Americans had not interfered with their southern
                        course.</p>

                    <p>But Mr. <note>James Alexander?</note> Smith was right though the antagonism
                        of the bureaucracy is basic and not increased by any personal
                        considerations. But Sir Elliot's (notice, he already had a title) position
                        as head of the Town Planning Association lent support to the idea that town
                        planning capacity was being used in the Federal City whereas it was nothing
                        but imperial obstruction.</p>
                    <p>He was put in charge of starting the business center and - ca va sans dire -
                        placed it in the center of a residential section. It has caused confusion
                        ever since. Nobody can find his way around. One day Griffin asked him why he
                        did that. Of course there was no reply. But since private ownership does not
                        exist in the capital and the minting of money costs the government nothing,
                        that mistake will be remedied in time which was not possible in Washington.</p>

                    <p>Allen Ravines comprise a most charming area of wooded glen and meadowed glade
                        luckily left undisturbed by the agricultural interests which have long
                        preempted the surrounding country. Its development is for the private use of
                        its owners as a suburban place of residence accessible by motor, and wherein
                        their common interests are met in the joint club house group and farm, and
                        their individual interests in the private cabins of the several brothers.</p>
                    <p>The scheme as a whole is based on a conception of the tract as a wilderness
                        to be maintained intact, so far as consistent with use, in its natural
                        state. The general tendency in preserving the few exceptionally beautiful
                        spots that are left to preserve in the midst of our civilization will be to
                        convert them into parks more or less public, and injured because of that
                        fact and of the consequent cleaning for use and thoroughfares, etc., etc.
                        Here where we are not forced by such considerations is the opportunity to
                        maintain a true relic of primeval Illinois.</p>
                    <p>This conception then determined, against the alternative of entering below
                        the grounds say over the levy from the road on the east, and for acquiring
                        land and entering at the northwest for a grandiose effect and for the
                        advantage of providing for traffic as far as possible away from the most
                        beautiful parts so that these are reached only last, by inconspicuous trails
                        and foot paths.</p>
                    <p>The entrance from the west side highway is located where one, on entering,
                        obtains a fine view of Decatur across the basin-like part of pasture most
                        suitable to field sports for the outings of the owners' factory employees
                        and at a level low enough to make the travel around the hill pasture and
                        through the woods gradual ascent without special grading to the vehicle
                        terminal, nowhere with a general view of the entire site and its boundaries,
                        always with the objective undiscovered beforehand, and the limits left to
                        the imagination.</p>

                    <p>The "Entertainment House," Garage, "Custodian's Lodge" are but a short
                        distance from the entrance yet sheltered from the highway by the round of
                        the hill. The "House" on a commanding peninsula overlooks the first ravine
                        with a vista of the Sangamon beyond and conversely shuts off the only
                        objectionable view now obtaining on the premises, that of the farm-house on
                        the highway as seen from the peninsula to the east of this one.</p>
                    <p>The Club Group is thus in a central position contiguous to the Game Fields as
                        well as to the woods and ravines, to the custodian for easy supervision and
                        to the features of wilderness, especially the spring-fed pool and private
                        green, and accessible directly by foot paths as well as indirectly by
                        "trails."</p>
                    <p>The cabins are located at such strategic points as indicated by their
                        different names, "Valley Views," "Meadow View," "River View" and "Glen
                        Point." They are reached from the Club by trails following lines where they
                        will least interfere with the wildest features of the landscape thus keeping
                        that rich rarity - a gem of Illinois forest as far as possible in its
                        primitive state. Only the slightest touch in the depths of the valley is
                        needed to make the springs available for a useful swimming pool.</p>
                    <p>The trails themselves as they leave the Club House are confined to such
                        treatment of the ground as will prevent rutting but will not indicate the
                        artificiality. The private domiciles in rough, saw-finished wood
                        construction are to become almost as natural as birds' nests or, where of
                        masonry, are to be terraced into the hillsides as unobtrusive as homes of
                        Cliff dwellers.</p>

                        <hi rend="ul">1915</hi></p>
                    <p>The first year in Australia was full indeed with doors opening and doors
                        slamming in our faces. Lifelong friends were made and lifelong enemies - we
                        to whom the word enemy had been heretofore unknown. In a way it was again
                        the Revolutionary War between America and Britain for our coming to
                        Australia was another throwing of the tea into the Boston Harbor.</p>
                    <p>And curiously enough Griffin's fight with the government was reflected in my
                        battles in private life. The publisher of a magazine, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor
                        and their pal, Mr. Stowe, who had tied up with us from the first days,
                        called me into their office and told me that from now on Griffin was to do
                        what they told him to do in Federal Capital matters, etc. I left pronto.</p>
                    <p>My own battle in Sydney is reflected in some of the correspondence of that
                        year. A number of fine and very capable women lined up with me in the
                        democratizing of Sydney's Town Planning Association. The following scraps of
                        correspondence will hint at what was going on. It came to a head in the Town
                        Planning Association in which a group of very capable women, including Mrs.
                            <note>William Arthur</note> Holman, the wife of the Prime Minister
                            <note>Premier</note> of New South Wales, who backed me through thick and
                        thin in the battle for a new and democratic constitution for the society.
                        The three chief enemies later spent much time vilifying Griffin going even
                        to the Prime Minister, Mr. <note>William Morris</note> Hughes, who showed
                        Griffin the matter they had put before him. The women won. These scraps of
                        correspondence hint what was going on.</p>
                    <p>17 February, 1915 - Dear Walter, Genevieve (Griffin's sister) worked all
                        Tuesday morning on the drawing of Mossmain, Montana with me so I got through
                        comfortably by four o'clock. Can't get a litho-print on tracing cloth
                        because the gelatin plate is moist. Can't get a litho at all satisfactory
                        this weather and he said it was impossible to make the print in one day so
                        am</p>
                    <pb n="52"/>

                    <p>having Helio <note>sepia diazo print?</note> made. Roy
                        <note>Lippincott</note> will bring it home tonight and I'll letter it in the
                        morning and take it down to mail at noon. Genevieve and I went down at ten
                        this morning for a swim. Mrs. Taylor called up just now to see if I would
                        come to the Town Planning annual meeting and lunch. Nothing to say but yes.
                        Genevieve is going to try to go down with me. Have written to Mrs. Franklin
                        that we are planning to go over to see her next Wednesday afternoon. (Mother
                        of Author of All That Swagger.) <note>Stella (Miles) Franklin published "All
                            That Swagger" in 1936.</note></p>
                    <p>I think in laying out the general perspective of Mossmain, Montana I'll stand
                        near the business center to bring that into big scale and look across to the
                        bluff and social center in the distance. The difficulty with this is that it
                        doesn't show the Yellowstone River. How about it? It might be better to make
                        my foreground the axis between the two centers. That would show the bluff
                        well but the distance would not be so interesting.</p>
                    <p>We are still living high off the birthday party, chicken salad last night,
                        chicken and rice tonight. Your devoted wife, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Roy brought home the Helio, a good print but you know what Helios are, kind
                        of pale at the best. By the time I had lettered it the buildings were
                        invisible so I blacked them in. Then it seemed a pity to put so much work on
                        and run the risk of not being able to get a reproduction after all so I
                        started in inking in the streets and ended by inking the whole thing
                        practically except the lines of the curb on the streets. Worked from seven
                        after supper straight through till three o'clock in the morning. Up again
                        and at it at eight and am now rushing down town to get it in the mail before
                        twelve - the latest for packages.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Holman called on us yesterday afternoon. Fed her on birthday cake. Miss
                        Sulman called me up last evening and I am to meet her at Farmers' to go
                        together to the Town Planning lunch. Very much pleasanter. Genevieve and Roy
                        had to report at jail this morning. Love, Marion</p>

                    <p>Melbourne - Dear Marion, Am leaving tomorrow night, Friday, in order to be on
                        hand when Senator Grant's <note>John Grant?</note> motion is under
                        consideration. It will not come up until about 8 P.M. today and no one can
                        tell what may happen to it or how it may be changed or what advice I may
                        want to give. Please go with Roy as escort to the Fitzgerald dinner and I
                        will send a telegram tomorrow to Sulman <note>John Sulman</note> expressing
                        my regrets, etc. I have just seen Grant who arrived in Melbourne at 2 this
                        afternoon and is also leaving tomorrow. I feel that all has been right with
                        you today. The Grahams are coming around all right (clients for a
                        residence). Lovingly, Walter.</p>
                    <p>Dearest Walter, I'm terribly lonesome tonight. Mr. and Miss Sulman have been
                        here. I'm afraid my surmise was true and that none of these men have any
                        desire to have what they are doing under the scrutiny of a bunch of
                        disinterested members. You can't get an Australian to be direct. Mr. Sulman
                        settled himself close to me, and Miss Sulman went over and engaged Roy and
                        Genevieve in animated conversation on the other side of the room. This was
                        after we had been out in the yard and had discussed the beauty of the
                        location in general. I asked him if he wanted to talk over Town Planning
                        matters. He said he wanted to ask how matters were getting along in
                        Melbourne. So we talked around the bush for a while and then, casually of
                        course making it seem as if it were not premeditated, he dropped into the
                        question. I can't give you the conversation but he insisted that the Women
                        could not be organized as a Branch. (They must this week have organized a
                        Randwick Branch.) He said the women could not take up general work but must
                        do what the Council told them to do. I said if that were the case the women
                        should be told what they were expected to do. He said they had thought they
                        could take up such subjects as would be delicate for the men to handle.
                        "That's why "we" have been giving such prominence to lowering street car
                        steps so that pregnant women might not sustain injury, and to the height of
                        laundry tubs." He said</p>
                    <note>John Sulman was a noted Australian architect and town planner. In 1908 he
                        had published a plan for Canberra. In the early 1920s he would become chair
                        of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee. A prestigious architecture prize,
                        the Sir John Sulman Medal, is named after him.</note>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 54 ====]</p>
                    <p>he had made out a minute to be given to us stating that our work was to be
                        the investigation of reserves and asked if that had been given to us. I told
                        him it had not. Finally he said why would it not be well to have just a
                        general conference. I said that was just what we were asking for. Well but
                        not to consider any special motion but just to talk things over to come to
                        an understanding. - - That's what we have asked for. There is no special
                        motion. - - But I was told we were to consider a motion of yours. - - No I
                        had no motion. - - Then the announcement we sent out isn't exactly correct.
                        - - No, Mr. Sulman that is one of our difficulties. We are not being
                        reported correctly. - - Are you sure there is no motion? - - Yes, the only
                        motions made were that we should hold two meetings for consultation on the
                        suggestions that were presented at the last meeting and any others that
                        might be made, one to be at the next regular meeting and one special next
                        week when we hoped the Council would meet with us.</p>
                    <p>And so the matter stands. The next meeting will certainly be a very difficult
                        one. Of course Mr. Sulman will be in the chair. He is very suave and I don't
                        know just how positive the women will be in the stand they take. To
                        accomplish anything it may be necessary for the women to get busy and
                        reorganize the main Association. Any 20 members can require the calling of a
                        Special Meeting to consider amending the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>And now I am tired sweetheart, kind of soul tired. So I am going to a lonely
                        bed, lovingly Marion.</p>
                    <p>Melbourne, 1915 April 28, Marion my darling, - I have been more or less in
                        the dumps since the conference yesterday, it all seemed so hopeless. There
                        did come out very plainly however the actual facts of the situation and I
                        put my side of it straight if not effectively. The enemy went the limit
                        also, even beyond I should say, but whatever were the chief's opinions in
                        the end he did not give me the least mite of encouragement and in fact did
                        convey the converse throughout.</p>

                    <p>Politics however is a strange affair and we can only await the next
                        development to give some further clue. I have booked for Friday night train
                        and can go into everything then. Mr. Murdoch is coming over this afternoon
                        too late for any information for this letter but since I cannot give
                        anything out to him I shall hope to gain some information.</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough coming down Sunday the car of the Governor General
                            <note>Ronald Munro-Ferguson</note> was attached to my train and his
                        stenographer was bunked in the same compartment with me. When we went into
                        the Albany Station for breakfast we saw his Ex. incog. <note>Excellency
                            incognito?</note> at table and he having noticed me sent word later for
                        me to visit him in his car which I did for two hours from Wangaratta to
                        Seymour stations. The Col. (Owen) <note>Percy Thomas Owen</note> (one of our
                        chief opponents M.M.G.) was in the same official car but was not in the
                        compartment with us during the confab. It was all very pleasant and I had a
                        chance to go into things somewhat and at the close His Excellency asked my
                        address and hoped for another meeting and said au revoir, all somewhat
                        encouraging.</p>
                    <p>As for the Graham house I stuck out for the court and have almost won them
                        over but am making an alternative showing the large 2 story hall in its
                        place without much modification other than a slightly more compact scheme.
                        It seems probable that this will be the one really to advise because with
                        the two stories close around three sides of the court as is necessary to get
                        in all the upstair space, there will be little chance for the sun to get
                        near the bottom and the real charm will be lost don't you think?</p>
                    <p>Hope you have been kept busy with club affairs during the interim without
                        family. Even Mr. Smith <note>James Alexander Smith?</note> has failed to
                        live up to the test and is fearful, after what I related to him, of the
                        consequences, but never you mind! I think it must have been an off moment
                        with him. Me for a declaration of independence! The Governor General was
                        good enough to point out that the American's desire for money was really his
                        desire for independence which is the most worth while of all. Lovingly
                        Walter</p>

                    <p>Melbourne, 1915 May 5. - Marion dearest, I am not forgetting to pray for your
                        good condition Thursday but there is no need to have solicitude on any other
                        grounds. I shall even forgive you if I get no letters during your rush. Here
                        everything is evidently just in the balance yet, I know absolutely nothing
                        new. I did have a long talk with the editor of one of the papers yesterday
                        afternoon, which was satisfactory but I am fully aware of the dominating
                        policy of the Melbourne Press which is anti-Canberra of course first and
                        last.</p>
                    <p>The House probably has met today and possibly the ruling of the Government
                        may become evident. Otherwise the Senate motion comes up tomorrow and then
                        more problems as to what to say and not say. I am wondering whether it will
                        be possible for me to leave tomorrow night. I cannot tell until I have seen
                        Senator Grant at least and he evidently will not arrive from Sydney until
                        tomorrow. Success and joy to you in the morning, Your loving Walter</p>
                    <p>Walter darling, Am on my way to conference with Mrs. Holman. Got to the
                        Circular Quay last night in time for the 8:15 ferry and found Genevieve and
                        Roy on it. They had been to Manly. Are planning to go next Sunday to see our
                        lot in Vaucluse and to call on Dawsons. Had quite a letter this morning from
                        Mrs. Cooper. Says they have five signatures to our petition for a special
                        meeting. Says Taylor and Hyman want a little quiet conference with her.
                        Wonders if they think her green as cabbage.</p>
                    <p>Have your map with me which I'll mail as soon as I reach town. Almost
                        finished inking Mossmain Cover. Think I can finish it this evening ready for
                        printing tomorrow. Do hope you got a berth last night and that Mr. Smith
                        won't dissuade you from a positive statement concerning where to locate the
                        factory plant. The lawyer told Roy he'd better see <note>J. Burcham</note>
                        Clamp alone, that if a solicitor went along Clamp wouldn't say a word. Such
                        nonsense. As if he's say a word to Roy if he went alone. Roy went to see him
                        and is going to try to make him go along.</p>

                    <p>Snaefell, Greenwich, 12 May 1915 - Dear Walter, Three more days and we shall
                        have been here a year. You should be here so that we might fittingly
                        celebrate the occasion (with tears and hisses and groans). We had our Town
                        Planning meeting yesterday. I am sure we got results - greater than I should
                        have thought possible. Mrs. Taylor <note>Florence M. Taylor</note> is really
                        a pathetic figure. She is like your friend Archie <note>William Oliver
                            Archibald</note>. (Minister of Home Affairs, called the Wombat by his
                        pals. M.M.G.) Her caretaker ought not to let her out of his sight. I don't
                        see how he is going to pull her out of this hole. I was very glad I had sent
                        in notice of my motion for organization for the Agenda paper for it led them
                        instead of sliding over things to come out and make a complete statement of
                        the correspondence since the last meeting so we did not have to do that. As
                        I told you, the women there are very far from being stupid and a number that
                        I have never met or talked to rose to the occasion. A Mrs. Thomas got up
                        immediately and inquired why the men should not take action on the motions
                        we made. Mrs. Taylor told her the motion was entirely out of order, so
                        unexpected, etc. She asked what there was out of order. "It was not on the
                        Agenda paper." To which I told Mrs. Thomas that so far as I knew the Agenda
                        paper was entirely unofficial and therefore informal and that any motion
                        from any member was quite in order. I hoped the matter would be followed up.
                        Then I passed around my scheme of organization.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Taylor tried to stop me after I had read a sentence or two but of course
                        I paid no attention to her, read through and explained as I went. Then made
                        my motion that the next meeting should be a purely business meeting for the
                        organization of the Section. Then we were lively for some fifteen minutes.
                        Mrs. Thomas got up promptly with the remark that there was much of value in
                        the suggestions and that as it was an important matter and that as only
                        about half of our members</p>
                    <note>Florence M. Taylor was an architect and engineer who was also interested
                        in town planning. In 1907 she married George A. Taylor, also an architect
                        and engineer, and together they founded a publishing company for trade and
                        professional journals. She is considered Australia's first professional
                        woman architect and was the first woman to fly a heavier-than-air craft, a
                        glider designed by her husband, in Australia (1909).</note>
                    <pb n="61"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 61 ====]</p>
                    <p>were there these suggestions be sent to all the members with the
                        understanding that it would be taken up at the next meeting. This as an
                        amendment to my motion was passed. Her promptness saved the day for then our
                        secretary Mrs. Taylor got up and delivered a tirade. "It was a pity that the
                        valuable time of the meeting should be taken up by such silly stuff. It was
                        entirely out of order." (It was in the order of the Agenda paper.) "Such an
                        outrage to thrust a great long mess of stuff on them so unexpectedly, etc."
                        Then Miss Geach bobbed up. She certainly is all right and has a good head,
                        ready to adjust herself to emergencies. She moved that we meet in two weeks
                        for a preliminary discussion. The Taylor cohorts had had a lively whispered
                        consultation during my reading. One now moved that the whole matter be
                        dropped. Mrs. Thomas reminded them that her motion had been passed. Miss
                        Geach reminded them that her motion was before the meeting and had been
                        seconded. They then suggested that the men's Council should be asked to meet
                        with us at that time. This was a substitute for the motion we had planned to
                        have Miss Geach make and was entirely satisfactory, so it was passed. I
                        enclose the agenda paper of the Men's council with notice of report of
                        Women's Committee today. It came in the mail this morning. It is almost a
                        pity you can't be there to witness this spicy report.</p>
                    <p>I shall be deeply interested in the stand the man take at our joint meeting.
                        Of course it is altogether probable that the men from motives of self
                        interest would much prefer not to be under the inspection and interference
                        of a bunch of disinterested women. I think however from what I have seen
                        they will not find the women entirely easy to manage. One of the ladies, a
                        stranger to me, came up to me after our meeting and said "they" would find
                        that a lot of brains had come into this club since the first meeting two
                        months age. I said I hoped she would be at the joint meeting and she said
                        she certainly</p>
                    <pb n="62"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 62 ====]</p>
                    <p>would. A number of others spoke to me in similar vein. One of the cohort, a
                        Mrs. Clark, had said that stuff of mine was pure theory. She didn't see why
                        they should bother with it. They showed themselves so purely spiteful and
                        personal that I think it had a very marked effect on the members as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Am going to call on Mrs. Wade this afternoon so must now write my letters to
                        Mrs. Mess and Mr. Melson (Chicago Clients). Wonder what sort of a hornet's
                        nest they will stir up this week and if they will show their stripes as
                        plainly as my hornets did.</p>
                    <p>Beautiful days we are having right along now. You ought to come and live in
                        Sydney. Hope the Grahams have told you to go ahead with working drawings.
                        Your loving wife. Marion</p>
                    <p>Dear Walter, I didn't tell you that Mrs. Holman said, "What do those men mean
                        by getting up there and talking all that dribble about lofty motives and
                        Australia this and that. What do they think we are anyway." Also that after
                        we were seated she said, "Lets go into the other room where perhaps we can
                        get a bit of carpet under our feet" - so she too suffers from cold feet -
                        that kind. Hope her chilblains aren't as bad as mine.</p>
                    <p>This afternoon I went to see Mrs. R.D. Hall at her husband's office, so I met
                        the State's attorney himself, while another lady came whose name I couldn't
                        understand. I'll call her X. She got quite heated about it after I had
                        explained the requisition, thought no action ought to be taken except at the
                        suggestion of the Secretary. Mrs. Holman said there was no secretary. X
                        answered that it ought not to be brought up except at the next meeting. But
                        there is nothing to meet said Mrs. Holman. But said X, a meeting has been
                        called for next Tuesday. If Mrs. Holman had any hesitation about signing,
                        this woman's talk evidently decided her to do so for when X said there were
                        two factions and she thought they ought to come together, she said that</p>
                    <pb n="63"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 63 ====]</p>
                    <p>was just the purpose of this requisition and walked off to sign it. X said
                        she thought nothing ought to be done in an underhand way but overboard with
                        which I entirely agreed. She is the only one I have run across that has not
                        been entirely in sympathy. So far as I can make out there is a very
                        widespread opinion that the Town Planning Association is in the wrong hands
                        and is being run for interested motives. I really think this is helping put
                        you straight before the reputable element of Sydney.</p>
                    <p>After that I went to Mrs. Milner's home. Her sister and Lady Lyne were there
                        and I find Lady Lyne is a very pleasant and wide awake woman. Mrs. Milner
                        said she had been inundated with petitions and pamphlets to which she had
                        paid no attention. I had feared she was one of those who would wish to drop
                        out. But all three signed very willingly. A number of names have been given
                        to me and it looks as if we should have our 20 names by the end of the week.</p>
                    <p>Miss Sulman called me up last night and asked me if I was going to the
                        Citizens Association Thursday. I told her I was and she said she would be on
                        the lookout for me there. I don't think her father gave her very particular
                        details of the meeting though the facts have been more or less in the
                        papers. Mrs. Milner told me the Friday Evening News said, Mrs. Taylor got up
                        and resigned but her husband grabbed her and said, "Don't do that," and she
                        sat down. The women as a whole are quite resentful of being made fools of
                        and do not as a whole seem inclined to lie down under it. And there seems to
                        be a feeling that they ought to be taking part in governmental work. Maybe
                        they'll take a hold of things yet and make some fur fly. Politics is very
                        fatiguing so I am going to bed. Got your letter this afternoon. So glad you
                        got a berth. Your lovingest wife, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Snaefell, New South Wales - 18 May 1915 - Dear Walter, The plot thickens. At
                        about six o'clock this evening Mr. Taylor <note>George A. Taylor</note>
                        called me up and in the most dictatorial tone conceivable (I'm sure the

                    <p>Your humble wife answered - I don't think I shall be down this week.</p>
                    <p>T. - Are you coming down tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>Me. I think I'll not be down this week. Will next week be all right?</p>
                    <p>T. Nawh - I want you to rescind that motion of yours for a meeting next week.</p>
                    <p>Me. That was not my motion.</p>
                    <p>T. We-e-el, that is your scheme of organization and I (I wish I could make
                        that "I" about four times that size) want you to recall it. When will you be
                        down?</p>
                    <p>Me. Do you want to come out to see me?</p>
                    <p>T. O, I suppose I might come out. I have a slight cold but I suppose I can
                        come out !!!!!!!</p>
                    <p>Me. When will you be out? (of course always in the most hospitable tones)</p>
                    <p>T. I'll run out tonight.</p>
                    <p>Me. Alright Mr. Taylor.</p>
                    <p>Then I went into the sitting room and told Roy and Genevieve that they must
                        not leave the room while T. was here and we began to try to think of
                        pleasant and noncontroversial topics of conversation. Couldn't talk about
                        the war of course. Couldn't mention the U.S.A. Couldn't talk about you. We
                        finally decided that the only safe subject would be the expected baby. So we
                        were going to ask him whether he thought Alstan a better name for a boy or a
                        girl, and since that was the only name we had been able to decide on, what
                        would he advise us to do if it were twins.</p>
                    <p>We toted the couch and drafting board out of the hall, leaving the horses
                        which, with the drawer upside down, made a very handsome coat rack, and Roy
                        brought his brand new velvet hat and his coat and laid them on it so that
                        the purpose of this mysterious looking piece of furniture might be
                        recognized at a glance. The big table in the</p>

                        chrysanthemums on it. We lighted the lights in all the rooms so that he
                        could glimpse our new sideboard and Genevieve's handsome dresser.</p>
                    <p>Then the telephone rang again. I answered. It was Mrs. Taylor this time and I
                        really ought not to have hung up the receiver while she was still talking
                        but I did. It was a pity because I missed a valuable human document in so
                        doing. Of course they used the telephone so as to have no witnesses. The
                        following I cannot possibly do justice to.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. T.- Now about this matter of organization, we want you to recall <hi
                            rend="ul">your</hi> motion. We don't want any confusion. Several of the
                        ladies have been to me about it. We want to maintain our womanliness. We
                        want to spare you any humiliation. We can. A number of the ladies have
                        spoken to me about it. The men decided your motion was all out of order.</p>
                    <p>Me.- Is Mr. Taylor coming over this evening?</p>
                    <p>Mrs. T.- Why, no he can't come over there. You know I made you
                        vice-president.</p>
                    <p>Me.- Oh, did you?</p>
                    <p>Mrs. T.- Yes I made you vice-president.</p>
                    <p>Me.- Oh.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. T.- Yes I made you vice-president you know and we hope you will have the
                        decency to resign. You were made vice-president not because of your
                        popularity. I suppose you know that. But you -</p>
                    <p>Here I hung up the receiver. A pity too because of course I know <hi
                            rend="ul">she</hi> made me vice-president (an interesting confession of
                        the truth of Mrs. Rutter's statement) because of the advertising value of
                        Walter Burley Griffin's name, and it would have been interesting to hear
                        just how she would put it.</p>

                    <p>While I was still writing this the telephone rang again. Genevieve went to
                        find out who it was and if it were the T's say I couldn't come to the phone
                        just now. Would they leave a message? But it was Miss Sulman to say that if
                        I was going to be at home she and her father would like to come over in the
                        afternoon. I told her I was delighted and tried to get them to stay to
                        dinner but they are coming earlier. They know you are not here. I bet Taylor
                        called him up to get him to take me in hand. Anyhow he is the president of
                        the Town Planning Association and I shall ask him what report was made to
                        the association. I told Miss Sulman I'd be glad to have a talk with her
                        father and I know they will expect me to bring up the subject. I shall leave
                        out all the spice and make no personal remarks but if he wants the facts of
                        our last meeting I'll give them to him still without spice, and without
                        using any names except those who made the motions. He probably knows he
                        can't get facts from the Taylors, and I shall ask him if the council is
                        going to hold a joint meeting with us as we asked.</p>
                    <p>Off to bed now. Playing the game with Australians is some sport if you look
                        at it that way. I hope you told Mr. J.A.S. <note>James Alexander
                        Smith?</note> I love him. It's good to find one person in a country you can
                        love. Lovingly, Marion.</p>
                    <p>20 May <note>1915</note> - Dear Walter, I didn't tell you that in talking
                        about the Melbourne matter Mr. Sulman told me that they were planning to
                        have some one of them go down to do what they could for you before the Works
                        Committee. He didn't know whether it would be himself or Taylor. I would
                        hate to think he would be guilty of a deliberate veiled threat like that but
                        he certainly laid himself open to suspicion. I told him that it was not yet
                        decided that the plan should be laid before the Works Committee. He said he
                        thought that had been settled. (Of course it never was laid before the Works
                        Committee. M.M.G.)</p>
                    <p>I am much encouraged by the fact that this morning a Mrs. Cooper called me
                        up. I don't know who she is but she wanted to say she hoped I wasn't going
                        to recall my motion. She lives out in Coogee. (Evidently McCauley has been
                        spreading that statement abroad.)</p>

                    <p>She is another we can count on not being willing to lie down and be walked
                        over. Must rush this to the Post Office if it is to go on this afternoon's
                        mail. Lovingly, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Snaefell, 25 May, 1915 - Dear Walter. Couldn't get away even in time to see
                        you off, at the railroad station. Got into town at eight ten and caught the
                        eight thirty ferry. Mr. and Mrs. Cooper are both very pleasant and direct
                        people. We met them at that dinner at Mrs. McCauley's when we were at
                        Coogee. They didn't hesitate to express themselves very frankly about the
                        Taylors and the McCauley Hyman bunch. They got right down to business to
                        find out the facts, for as Mrs. Cooper said she didn't care what she said.
                        She just wanted to be sure of her ground. She learned what was brewing at
                        the meeting of the delegation of the women for tree planting at Randwick at
                        which meeting the Randwick branch was formed. They were told there that Mrs.
                        Griffin was trying to run them into an American scheme. "Why," said Mrs.
                        Taylor, "that's a verbatim copy of the Hull House constitution."
                            <note>Handwritten phrase follows:</note> which I had never seen nor
                        probably had she.</p>
                    <p>As Mrs. Cooper said, "What if it was!" Mrs. Hyman told Mrs. Cooper they
                        thought I ought to resign. "Nonsense," said Mrs. Cooper. "She ought to be
                        president. She's got the brains to wipe up the floor with the rest of that
                        whole bunch." Mr. Cooper is going to join the Town Planning Association so
                        that if the matter is referred to a Special Meeting of the members he can be
                        on hand to help his wife. She is entirely ready to bring up the points. She
                        said Mrs. Lee Brown was in sympathy with our attempt to organize but had
                        told her that she had been told there was going to be a big fight and
                        thought she wouldn't come to this meeting. Mrs. Cooper told her she ought to
                        come if she did nothing more than cast a vote. Said she would try to see
                        that she came.</p>
                    <p>I'll leave this letter open to add a PS, after the meeting this P.M. before I
                        mail it, that you may know I'm still alive. I don't think it will be
                        necessary for me to say a word. Roy got your roll of</p>
                    <pb n="69"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 ====]</p>
                    <p>drawings from the railroad office. You must be sure to ask your porter if you
                        see him if he was the one who found them. Roy says he saw some clippings
                        about a theatre Brown is going to build. More cause for Clamp's <note>J.
                            Burcham Clamp's</note> hurry. From what I could make out over the phone,
                        though it is troublesome, they can fix the Town Hall for a lantern for my
                        lecture. I am to see Miss Valentine at 4 tomorrow to talk it all over. I got
                        the candies you left and devoured most of it before I turned in. Marion.</p>
                    <p>Snaefell - 25 May <note>1915</note> - Dear Walter, The boat is a day late so
                        we don't get our mail till tomorrow or probably the next morning. In the
                        excitement of this afternoon I forgot to mail my letter to you. Five of us
                        went to the Civil Service for tea after, and then Miss Geach and I went to
                        the quay together and just caught a ferry.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to do justice to this afternoon's meeting and it now only
                        remains to wipe the scandal of the central organization out as completely. I
                        don't know whether the women will want to take the trouble to do that or
                        not. We are going to try them on a motion for a Special meeting of the
                        Central Association. Today it was Mrs. Holman, wife of the Prime Minister
                            <note>Premier</note> of New South Wales who brought things to a crisis.
                        Mr. Sulman took the chair, dismissed my case with a word, said Mr. Taylor
                        would explain matters to us. He got up and told us how undesirable it would
                        be to look to Canada or the United States for inspiration in Town Planning
                        questions, told us how many great Town Planning experts there were in the
                        Council, your name not being on the list, and how phenomenally successful
                        was the work of the Women's Committee.</p>
                    <p>When he got through Mrs. Holman rose looking her stunningest and said she
                        really didn't know what kind of an association this was, that she had been
                        asked to preside, and notices to that effect had been sent out, but that
                        when she comes she finds that someone else takes the chair, no explanation
                        is made to her, and she doesn't knew what is going on. That she is a very
                        busy woman, too busy to have her time taken in such a way and that she
                        resigned her office. A deadly silence fell on</p>
                    <pb n="70"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 70 ====]</p>
                    <p>the meeting as she left the room. The men, consisting by the way of Sulman,
                        Taylor, O'Carrol and Major Stowe, certainly did look abashed. Could you have
                        imagined they would have been so stupid as to have tried to handle Mrs.
                        Holman so crudely.</p>
                    <p>I immediately rose and said that considering the stand Mrs. Holman had taken
                        I thought the thing to do was for all the officers to resign that an
                        election might take place under circumstances that could be clearly
                        understood so that no misunderstandings could arise. I therefore resigned my
                        office. Taylor and Hyman followed suit. McCauley wasn't there. So what I
                        didn't dream could be accomplished was done and there are no officers of the
                        Town Planning Association women's branch. Several of the ladies were out in
                        the hall with Mrs. Holman. They motioned me to come out. "What's all this
                        about," said Mrs. Holman. "It's a scandal," I said, "and I'm deeply grateful
                        to you for opening the way out." "Well good," she said.</p>
                    <p>I returned and the discussion that followed was lively. After some five
                        minutes Mrs. Milner slipped in at my side and asked if she could propose my
                        name as a member of the Women's National Association. I said I should be
                        proud to have her do so. She said I would be in my proper place there, that
                        "those people" were utterly impossible.</p>
                    <p>It would take a long time to report the afternoon's performance but the gist
                        of it was that Mrs. Chris Thomas, Miss Geach and Mrs. Copper asked a lot of
                        very pertinent questions and made a number of direct remarks and if those
                        men felt as foolish as they looked they could not have had a very
                        comfortable time. The ladies made it clear that they did not intend to stand
                        for being pulled around by the nose like a bunch of children as Mrs. Thomas
                        put it, that if they were not a Branch but a Committee as the men put it,
                        saying they could not have Presidents and vice-presidents, that the
                        constitution did not provide for Committees except of Council members and
                        therefore the motion of the Council forming us was out of order, that to
                        have an organization of two hundred or so members with one hundred women
                        without</p>
                    <pb n="71"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 71 ====]</p>
                    <p>representation was not fair and that it was desirable to have some amendment
                        of the Constitution and that it was desirable that the suggestions for
                        organization made should be considered.</p>
                    <p>Before the meeting Sulman came to me and said - Then I am to say that you
                        recall your motion. No, I said, I had told him before that it was the motion
                        of Miss Geach and Mrs. Thomas. When he opened the meeting he said - the
                        notice says there is a motion of Mrs. Griffin's to be considered. Is that
                        the case Mrs. Griffin? I got up and said that the motion I had made had not
                        been seconded nor passed and that therefore I did not have a motion before
                        the meeting. On the spur of the moment, since I knew the facts, I left it
                        there instead of explaining that I had accepted Mrs. Thomas's modification.
                        It later exposed their duplicity but at the time it flabbergasted Mrs.
                        Thomas. But the fact that my suggestion had been informal and that the
                        motion had been made by Mrs. Thomas was stated in the minutes which Mr.
                        Sulman read a little later. Toward the end of the meeting when questioned by
                        the women as to why the matter for which this meeting had been called had
                        not been taken up he said again that I said I had no motion therefore there
                        was no special business. Then I got up and said that was misrepresentation
                        as I had told Mr. Sulman of the status of my motion and of Mrs. Thomas and
                        Miss Geach whose motion as recorded in the minutes was the business of this
                        meeting. I think that cleared me with Mrs. Thomas.</p>
                    <p>Major Stowe made quite a speech saying what valuable work the women were
                        doing in the matter of wash tubs with which he had come to have an
                        appreciative feeling since he had been in military service - at which
                        several ladies snickered - that it was foolish for us to bother our heads
                        with matters of legislation, that was for the future, that he must say that
                        some suggestions that had been made made him sick. Mrs. Thomas after the
                        meeting asked him what it was that had made him sick. She also asked Mr.
                        Sulman if they had had any legal advice and suggested it might be well for
                        them to get a few legal minds on their council.</p>
                    <pb n="72"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 72 ====]</p>
                    <p>Dear Walter - Had a good talk with Mrs. Holman yesterday. Apparently she has
                        no intention of rescinding her resignation though Mr. Fitzgerald had been to
                        her and asked that, as a special favor to him, she would. She told him that
                        she couldn't see how, personal feeling aside, she could subject her
                        husband's office (Mr. Holman, Premier of the state of New South Wales) to
                        such hazards whether they arose from malice or ignorance. She approves of
                        taking the matter to a Special Meeting and gave me several names to take the
                        requisition to. When I said I thought Mr. Sulman would be relieved if we
                        women pushed the thing through and got the central body out of the rut, she
                        lifted her eyebrow and said "Do you think so?"</p>
                    <p>She says that they have been full of explanations since, the stories don't
                        sound good to her. Mr. Sulman had profusely apologized but Mrs. Taylor had
                        said to her that coming up on the train <hi rend="ul">she</hi> had told Mr.
                        Sulman that Mrs. Holman ought to preside but Mr. Sulman had said no he must

                    <p>I have sent the bookcover off to the printers. Lovingly, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Well we got the 20 signatures. A general meeting was called and the society
                        was reorganized.</p>
                    <p>22 July 1915 - Dear Walter, Received a letter from Mr. Sulman today with the
                        apology of the Town Planning Association council and enclosing apology from
                        Stowe. Could not ask for a nicer letter from Council though it is easy to
                        guess their feelings. I have answered that I was very glad indeed to receive
                        the letter from him and the enclosure from Major Stowe. Thanking him for his
                        courtesy. Mrs. Weston called me up saying she had heard of Stowe's letter.
                        Said she had been talking it all over with her husband who utterly condemned
                        the things they were doing and considered them very serious. Said she
                        appreciated that if it hadn't been for me they wouldn't have realized the
                        sort of hands they had fallen into. Asked me to</p>

                        Mrs. Griffin, By a letter from Mrs. Cooper which I read to the Council of
                        the Association yesterday and by the admission of the Honorary Treasurer, it
                        appears that Major Stowe returned your subscription as a member. In
                        connection therewith the following resolution was carried and I was asked to
                        forward the came to you.</p>
                    <p>"That this Council conveys to Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Burley Griffin the apology
                        of the Council for the unauthorized action of the Honorary Treasurer as set
                        out in his letters to them dated July 15th and informs them that this
                        Association welcomes their membership and regrets exceedingly the pain
                        caused to then by this action."</p>
                    <p>The above will show the feeling of the Council on the matter and I trust that
                        any annoyance you may have felt will be allayed and your co-operation in the
                        work of the Association assured.</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,<lb/> John Sulman President.</p>
                    <p>Dear madam,</p>
                    <p>It has been pointed out to me by the Council of the Town Planning Association
                        that in my letter to you of July 15th I had no authority to write as I did,
                        and I therefore apologize to you for the same and for the remarks therein
                        which I much regret.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully,<lb/> F. Ernest Stowe.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday I expected to be a terribly trying day but it turned out to be a
                        very delightful one. I went into it blind. Some days ago Mrs. Wallace, a
                        reporter, told me the man she had introduced me to some weeks age at the
                        Town Planning meeting at the Botanic Gardens would like to further the
                        acquaintance and had asked her to ask me to take an excursion</p>

                    <p>with them. He is the one who stole a flower for me and I understood at that
                        time that he was a reporter recently out from England and planning to
                        return. So I expected to be quizzed for copy. But nothing of the kind
                        happened. He is an old bachelor and is writing historical accounts of early
                        Australia, etc., and was a very pleasant host. The trip was for all day to
                        Pittwater where he has a lot on which he is postponing building because of
                        the war. He took us about in a launch. A perfectly beautiful body of water.
                        There were occasional showers with the lights continually changing from mist
                        to sunshine, a really miraculous day to the eye. I know he wants to meet you
                        so I told him I would try to get him over to the house as soon as I could
                        catch you. He suggested several walks which he said he would gladly guide us
                        on any time we called him up. Must scurry this over to the Post Office. A

                        you'll have to quit your slothful ways and get busy. Devotedly, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Melbourne, July <note>1915</note> - Dearest Marion, My session with the Works
                        Committee et al. did not amount to much and I must see them again next
                        Tuesday afternoon. They are seeking some way to have me cooperate with the
                        Department <note>of Home Affairs?</note> which, though I can't say so, I
                        must somehow demonstrate to be impossible as of course we are forced to
                        realize.</p>
                    <p>Tonight I dine with George Elgh (who had helped us with the drafting of the
                        Federal Capital Drawings in Chicago M.M.G.) and his wife (who were now in
                        Australia). I have been driven from pillar to post to keep up with the
                        demands this week and have to keep it up through Saturday to satisfy our
                        Cafe clients who of course are in an awful hurry whereas the Works Committee
                        is pressing on the other hand. I got your telegram and shall bring the
                        photos which I hope will be in time. I don't dare post them for they may get
                        left altogether. Lovingly yours, Walter.</p>
                    <p>Walter me darlint, Was so relieved to get your telegram. Hope you were not
                        feeling worse again at night, and hope you got the gelesemium</p>

                        to stand on the top of this precipice making this vista from the valley

                            Lucas'</note> new cafe, the first example in Melbourne of the work of
                        Walter Burley Griffin, the Director of Design and Construction of the
                        Federal Capital, is arousing great interest and is giving people an inkling
                        of the fact that interest in architecture need not be limited to the
                        technically initiated but can give real joy to everyone as music does. It
                        will help the average citizen to realize that his Federal Capital may afford
                        him the same sort of intense personal pleasure as he would get from a
                        concert and be not merely a thing for abstract pride based on the opinion
                        dictated to him by a cult which he has been taught that he must respect, why
                        he knows not.</p>
                    <p>The problem - a cafe - calls for the arresting of the attention of the
                        passer-by, and this one certainly does it. In the midst of the dull tints of
                        the business buildings of the street, the clear positive tones arrest the
                        eye - green pearl granite, black like the purple grackle's plumage, and in
                        the same way - with iridescent tints - really a porphyry rather than a
                        granite, which more than one passer-by stops to touch wondering just what it
                        is; taking a polish which is permanent as no black marble could be when so
                        exposed; recessed fillets of Delft tile, gold burned on, arched over by a
                        fanciful square arch of white quartz granite whose pointed voussoirs extend
                        through the vaulted vestibule the center one becoming the lighting fixture
                        of the entrance. These materials set the key-note for the color scheme of
                        the whole in gold and ivory, a quiet though rich background for all colors
                        whether in floral decoration or in ladies' costume.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly the handsomest cafe in Australia, it calls forth constant
                        expression of pleasure as - "My word, it is beautiful," or "I feel as if I
                        had rubbed Aladdin's lamp." And eyes, instead of being turned to the food
                        before one, are everywhere fixed on</p>

                    <p>some charming effect before one. Everywhere the question is asked - "What
                        style is it?" As the work is not imitative but simply a direct solution of
                        the problem in hand there is, of course, no answer except that it is modern
                        Australian architecture, for style is purely an historical question and
                        cannot be determined till after the lapse of time when, looking back,
                        relationship can be established.</p>
                    <p>On entering the luxurious lobby with its comfortable leather couches, the
                        imagination is immediately appealed to by glimpses, through fern room and
                        fountain court, to the main dining room beyond and there is no difficulty
                        whatever in getting patrons through to the farthest tables as always one
                        wants to go on a bit to see more completely an attraction which the eye
                        catches yet further on.</p>
                    <p>The fulfillment of the basic principle of architecture - the conservation of
                        rhythm - is not only met but is sensed by those of an analytical turn of
                        mind:- "The surprising thing about this place is how big it looks. When you
                        pace it off you find the distances are not great, but it seems so spacious!"
                        This is accomplished not only by illusiveness of form and scale but by most
                        careful selection of color values, soft ivories to rich ambers glowing yet
                        restful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Griffin has found most sympathetic assistance in the artists of Melbourne
                        whose mural decorations by Bertha Merfield <note>1869-1921</note> and
                        sculpture by Miss <note>Margaret</note> Baskerville <note>ca.
                        1861-1930</note> are delightfully harmonious and exquisite supplements to
                        the architectural treatment. It would be hard to find anywhere more charming
                        unifying of sculpture with architecture than in the three groups forming the
                        great structural piers at the foot of the grand staircase in the central
                        promenade. Miss Margaret Baskerville has leaped to her task with a spirit
                        free and alive, with a mastery of her technique that leads her</p>

                        buildings of Melbourne which has a light court above the ground floor
                        enabling a considerable part of the Cafe to be illuminated by daylight
                        through patterned glass in the ceiling.</p>
                    <p>All partitions were torn out <note>of</note> the superstructure of the upper
                        stories becoming heavy beams resting on huge highly ornamented piers. The
                        result is spectacular.</p>

                    <p>without a moment's hesitation to destroy her work if it has not met the
                        architectural requirements absolutely, satisfied with nothing short of
                        perfection. She has produced a group of girlish figures - Persephone, Echo
                        and Daphne of exquisite freshness and spirit. Anyway perhaps it takes a
                        woman to model a woman.</p>
                    <p>FOUNTAIN COURT</p>
                    <p>The motif in these piers is illusive again. Under the projecting light shelf
                        of each of these piers is the single figure stepping lightly through a field
                        of grain with a background of tree foliage - the orange, the almond, the
                        cherry - which foliage is apparently carried through to the opposite side,
                        facing the fountain court where the tree itself becomes the motif of the
                        panel and forms a rich decoration balancing the figures opposite.</p>
                    <p>The architectural motifs carried throughout are the triangle, the circle and
                        the thorny vine. Used in piers where the conventional cap has been entirely
                        abolished, the decoration is carried the full length of the pier - very rich
                        in effect.</p>
                    <p>From Lobby to Fern Room - and in Australia one can use the most superb of all
                        its forms - the tree fern varying in heights from five to fifteen feet - for
                        decoration, invited by the glow of sun-light filtered through the ceiling
                        glass of varying tints of amber, the eye is arrested by two unique
                        sculptured landscapes, high reliefs on either side of a structural pier, the
                        Port Phillip fig tree of the Melbourne Harbor, by Charles Costerman, and the
                        Port Jackson ti-tree of the Sydney Harbor, by Marion M. Griffin, typifying
                        their most characteristic arboreal forms, the Port Phillip fig, a superb
                        tree clinging by its huge roots to the edge of the precipitous bluff, and
                        the Port Jackson ti-tree, wind blown with their curious twisted weird tangle
                        of trunks.</p>
                    <p>On to the Fern room, the ceiling light a continuation of that of the Fountain
                        court but enriched with angular pattern of greens in geometric leaf forms.

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>Of the Cafe Australia one could perhaps say it is the most beautiful Cafe in
                        the world. It is certainly unique. It introduced Griffin to Australia
                        because it was the first completed work of his over there. It occupied the
                        ground floor of a down town building under the light well of the building
                        and consisted of five rooms separated not by walls but by great piers which
                        carried the structure of the building above.</p>
                    <p>It is lighted in part by the open vaulted grill under the light well and
                        partly by stained glass ceiling panels screening electric lamps. The tiles
                        used are real gold delft tiles brought from Holland. The sculpture was done
                        by Miss Baskerville of Melbourne and the mural decoration by Miss Merfield
                        of Melbourne.]</p>

                    <p>partitions but piers only, of gold Delft tile this time, enclosing four pools
                        for gold fish with fountain spray lighted by a clever device throwing
                        ever-varying prismatic lights glowing in the water and reflecting in the
                        gold tile, the whole set in boxes of growing flowers and surrounded by
                        greenery. To one side of these rooms is the grand staircase leading to the
                        balcony of the Dining Hall. Here the motive of the piers is used for newel
                        posts surmounted by great bowls of palms and flowers and drooping vines.</p>
                    <p>The day lighting of all the rooms is through ceilings of glazed and molded
                        perforated pattern. The artificial lighting is indirect, concealed in the
                        broad light shelf which forms the strong line connecting all the rooms. In
                        the Dining Hall it is developed into a balcony richly decorated with a
                        series of light standards rising from it forming flamboyant light fixtures
                        pierced just enough to direct light to penetrate and give a jeweled effect.</p>
                    <p>BANQUET HALL</p>
                    <p>A great semi-circular vault formed of open tracery spans the room. This great
                        airy sunny room, cozy in spite of its size because of the balcony with its
                        alcoves below formed by the supporting piers with their gay caps, is by far
                        the most attractive dining room in Melbourne or even Australia.</p>
                    <p>MURAL</p>
                    <p>Miss Merfield's mural forms an essential element in the decoration,
                        representing dawn in the Australian bush - tall Eucalyptus trees with their
                        gleaming foliage shimmering against the mists rising in the valley, with the
                        distant mountains - the vivid golden blue sky for which Australia is noted.</p>
                    <p><note>This paragraph is entirely handwritten.</note><lb/> The charm of the
                        whole is added to by the remarkable acoustic properties of the rooms. Mr.
                        Lucas's daughters themselves, all musicians, see to at that the music itself
                        is attractive and centrally placed. It is heard in all parts with a purity
                        of tone that is very noticeable.</p>

                    <p>Griffin's private office was always very busy. He had contractual right with
                        the government to give half his time to his private practice. It seemed the
                        last straw when, although Canberra was absorbing the whole of his days and
                        more, he took on the job of remodeling the interior of one of the city'
                        buildings on Collins Street for Mr. Lucas who afterward became the Greek
                        Consul-General in Australia. Mr. Lucas and his wife were making a good
                        living in the restaurant business but the class of his work was totally
                        transformed by the Character of this Cafe Australia for the beauty obtained
                        through the dignity and richness of design rather than the expenditure of
                        large sums woke up Melbourne; and the elite of the city, including Dame
                        Melba <note>Nellie Melba, noted Australian-born soprano</note>, not only
                        came to the opening banquet but became habitues. It was the first step in
                        the transformation of the dingy Australian housing of these daily
                        necessities of life. Thus does architecture influence the whole character of
                        a community quite apart from its influence as architect on fellow
                        architects. The other cafes were naturally losing their custom to Mr. Lucas.
                        Mr. Lucas expressed his appreciation by thanking Mr. Griffin and saying he
                        had made a "gentleman" of him. A true gentleman Mr. Lucas had always been
                        from the American point of view.</p>
                    <p>The great banquet hall, with balconies supported by gold tile columns
                        terminating six feet above the balcony rail in concrete lanterns for
                        indirect lighting, is a barrel vaulted room the ceiling of which is wholly
                        open plaster screen through the pattern of which the daylight pours and at
                        night the semi-indirect lighting of this room is terminated by a beautiful
                        mural decoration by Bertha Merfield whose motif was the gum trees in the
                        gully with a wonderful mist and cloud effect so characteristic of Australia.
                        The whole room is keyed high with colors of gold and orange so that Miss
                        Baskerville brought into the offices one day a sprig of the blossom of the
                        Cotyledon so decorative in form and color, sure that she had found the motif
                        on which the design had been based. But a designer does not work directly,</p>

                        principles and its luxuriance. She is the sculptress who did the three
                        lovely Greek figures - Daphne, Echo, &amp; Persephone - in full relief
                        on the three heavy piers which one faces as he comes down the grand stairway
                        from the balcony. These could hold their own in any comparison with Greek
                        work of this type, each of these lovely beings stepping forth from the
                        grains which suggest, the function of the Cafe. I had given her the motifs
                        we desired for these three figures. The Center one was Echo, blowing her
                        horn. When I went over to her studio to see the progress on this one I found
                        to my consternation that she had not molded her facing directly forward as I
                        had sketched but for the sake of grace had turned her body slightly. The
                        work was so far advanced that I could hardly bring myself to raise
                        objections but since I was responsible to Mr. Griffin in this matter I
                        overcame my shyness and explained how from an architectural point or view
                        this central figure, directly opposite the stairway, must be markedly
                        different from Daphne and Persephone on either side and must be running
                        straight forward toward the descending patrons. She saw the point and
                        without a qualm ripped out the figure and built her up anew.</p>
                    <p>The way in which these two fine artists worked with the architect and the
                        delight they took in doing so showed what our civilization could accomplish
                        if it were not under the heel of that devil, SECURITY so worshipped by our
                        present cowardly civilization.</p>
                    <p>On the reverse side of these piers, facing the lunch room, Miss Baskerville
                        did three fruit trees in high relief, extremely interesting and charming.
                        This room is lighted through patterned glass in color and is divided from
                        the entrance lounge by a fountain basin, again between two of the heavy gold
                        tile piers, real Dutch gold tile, beyond which is another pier with the Port
                        Jackson fig tree in high relief on one side and the characteristic tree of
                        the Sydney Harbor, on the other side, the Leptospermun, that most
                        picturesque ti-tree whose twisted trunks,</p>

                        I did myself and it has always been one of my pet babies.</p>
                    <p>So we were well rewarded for the agonizing days and months when I had to
                        stand as mediator between Mr. Griffin who, as designer, had of course to
                        make all decisions, and the office force. We two could get together only at
                        night when I could put before him each issue and get his instructions and
                        designs for carrying on the work. And then the task of getting decisions
                        from Mr. Lucas! How could he be expected to understand what was being put
                        before him? I remember the last struggle to get the authority to put the
                        whole thing in hand. We had dinner at his cafe and had talked till after
                        midnight when be said, "Well go ahead." We went home and Mr. Griffin
                        immediately went to the telephone and called up the contractor, told him to
                        have material on hand and work started early the next morning. The
                        contractor, knowing the nature of some of the struggles for decisions, did
                        as told and materials were being piled up and work was in hand by six
                        o'clock in the morning which was well since by ten o'clock Mr. Lucas was
                        ringing Mr. Griffin to say he did not think he could go on with the work. As
                        you have seen, in the end he was well satisfied. It was in fact his natural
                        temperament to be frightened in the making of a decision. But he was not an
                        Anglo Saxon so was able to appreciate beauty as it developed. He became one
                        of Mr. Griffin's continual clients.</p>

                    <p>The private roadways to the individual farms are treated as natural branches
                        of the public road system and are therefore governed by the same

                        the reaching of a commanding building site for each homestead and its direct

                        which is the more important of two outlets on account of the lesser fare

                    <p>In Emory Hills <note>Wheaton, Illinois</note>, a development of 20 acres into
                        nine small farms of various areas, the problem was to afford the maximum
                        opportunity to Chicago commuters at a distance of 28 miles from the city to
                        make use of their limited hours of freedom in a more substantial form of
                        recreation than mere pleasure seeking. Under such conditions farming is
                        properly an intensive craft and not another species of executive distraction
                        to add to those of the organizations with which these commuters are
                        identified in the city itself. The prime objects in the scheme of this group
                        is then the maximum of convenience for the work of each plot for a minimum
                        of expense in equipment and help, utilizing the various modern public
                        services obtainable from the town with which it is connected. However,
                        health and enjoyment of mind and body before pecuniary profits are
                        objectives demanding natural rural attractiveness.</p>
                    <p>Broadways are run in easy sweeps with the sharper curvatures concealing the
                        steeper ascents. Tangential intersections permit narrow traffic ways with
                        easy turns at the same time affording frequent wooded park spaces,
                        preserving the rural character, offering shelter, diversifying the views,
                        increasing the floral variety and adding means for passing or turning
                        vehicles. The plot in the south east corner is given over for children.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of maximum development and maximum frontage carried out in the
                        finally adopted scheme has given seven acres of really valuable recreation
                        space and greatly enhanced view and air provision for all, with each owner
                        left with the same street frontage and a depth of 100 feet for exclusive
                        use. The advantages of placing each building in a direction parallel to its
                        lot and park frontage is that this arrangement gives maximum benefit of the
                        best views. Staggering the structures themselves opens prospects still
                        further to the extent of at least one and generally the two additional sides
                        for each house.</p>
                    <p>All will benefit not only from the open campus and courts for rest and
                        recreation free from vehicular traffic and danger but also will enjoy lane
                        approaches which, ample for vehicles, are sequestered and domesticated in
                        relation to the through lines of traffic of the city by terminal parks set
                        off with evergreen plantings and reflecting pool.</p>

                            The Architectural Review - 1913</bibl>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1910 the Commonwealth of Australia prepared to invite
                        competitive designs for laying out a proposed new Federal Capital City at
                        Canberra, a naturally beautiful site selected in New South Wales, requiring
                        locations for a vice-regal residence, Capitol and Parliamentary buildings,
                        public offices, university, station, citadel and military barracks;
                        residential, municipal, market and manufacturing centers, and other groups
                        of public and private buildings, as well as possible locations for
                        particular interests and trades properly disposed within the city area.</p>
                    <p>The site lies in a valley between three hills of considerable elevation -
                        "Ainslie," "Black Mountain," and "Mugga-Mugga," - with the peak of Bimberi
                        importantly dominating the landscape thirty miles away and nearly south of
                        the city. A portion of the valley is occupied by waterways that have been
                        partially formalized and adapted to the purposes of Mr. Griffin's plan by
                        some retaining dikes, used also as avenues of connection. Reference to the
                        detailed plan shows how the series of hexagonal and octagonal units give
                        convenient relation between the various parts of the city.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 98 ====]</p>
                    <p>The long vista of government and municipal buildings is on the axis
                        established by Mount Ainslie at the north east and Bimberi Peak at the
                        southwest. The vista along the waterway cuts across this axis at right
                        angles - from Black Mountain at the northwest to Lake Park on the southeast.
                        To the north are located the agricultural suburbs, with a market center and
                        military group east of the central basin - which, on its northern side, is
                        bordered by the museums and Public Gardens - to balance the university and
                        municipal centers in a corresponding location on the west. Directly north
                        are the manufacturing suburbs and railway yards; and the principal
                        residential center is between Mugga-Mugga and Black Mountain, at the west of
                        the Capitol building. It is easy to realize how well the plan has been
                        adapted to the natural features of the site. The forested ranges and distant
                        snow-covered peaks to the south and west provide a panoramic background; the
                        three local mountains within the city, which have been retained in their
                        natural state, as well as the lesser hills, utilized as sites for the
                        important groups, all end thoroughfare vistas, - while the needed waterways
                        have been utilized to increase the architectural effect of the principal
                        groups - and the flatter valleys or plateaus have been retained for
                        industrial or residential purposes. The principal water-basin, the
                        "Molonglo," near Black Mountain Reservation, remains in its present wild
                        state; the more formal basins being shut off by the dam and roadway that
                        flood the large central basin, utilized for equalizing the conditions of
                        humidity in the city, and for architectural effect.</p>
                    <p>The plan is dominated by those considerations of space that rendered Paris
                        and Washington so impressively effective, and were also peculiarly adaptable
                        to the large scale and natural grandeur of the selected site; while
                        permitting the more important buildings to be correspondingly large in scale
                        in the areas they cover - thus providing adequate floor space without
                        extending the buildings to an undue and disproportionate height.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 99 ====]</p>
                    <p>The Capitol is placed on "Kurrajong" Hill, commanding an extended view of the
                        city and distant landscape. The Parliamentary buildings occupy a lower-lying
                        plateau, below which may still be seen the next lower terrace, with the
                        water-front along the Public Gardens and the vista along the broad plaisance
                        to the Casino and Ainslie at its opposite end. The Parliament plateau is 40
                        feet above the courtyard below, which in turn lies 25 feet above the lowest
                        terrace, along the water frontage.</p>
                    <p>Adopting the adjacent mountains as focal points of the plan makes them
                        inversely the best positions from which to view the city; as in the general
                        perspective view of the site looking from Ainslie directly southward towards
                        the Capitol building along the more important axis.</p>

                    <p>Of course, all planning being such, this paper can only direct attention to
                        certain features not always recognized. This subject, however, is not so
                        trite as it should be, and would be, were it not for very many persistent
                        and prevailing notions set arbitrarily by general governmental practice and
                        immediately by the dominant military standards superimposed upon the already
                        heavy load of habits and fixed ideas that have extended unsuitable and
                        obsolete practice from generation to generation.</p>
                    <p>The present cry for economy, if made and taken seriously, and understood,
                        would not, to a town planner's mind, be a matter for regret, but of promise,
                        and would point the way to sloughing off many impediments that otherwise are
                        likely to bring us down in the end. Really it cannot then mean general
                        parsimony, but a launching out in new and greater undertakings than ever,
                        when we begin to realize what superfluous and futile effort has so far
                        engaged us and absorbed the investment of our stupendous output and
                        prevented our benefiting from the technical knowledge and mechanical powers
                        we have been so busily accumulating, and as busily applying blindly with no
                        comprehensive sense of economy and, therefore, little or no ultimate or
                        tangible good in time of peace, and only infinite harm in war.</p>
                    <p>In civil work, as opposed to military operation, what could be the
                        alternative to planning for economy in its broadest sense? Our duty was once
                        said to be to direct the great sources of power in nature to the use and
                        convenience of man, but it has since been pointed that it is now fully as
                        much our function as planners, as engineers, to determine what not to do,
                        what not to construct, in order best to meet the use and convenience of man;
                        that is to relieve him of the burdens of improper or superadaption
                            <note>improper superadaptation?</note> of nature, that a civilization
                        may be making worse even than the under-development of primitive and simple
                        life. The expenditures at Canberra were an instance of exceptional precocity
                        in painting the lily.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 101 ====]</p>
                    <p>When we find the civilized world now able to throw away each day £25,000,000
                        of current earnings (not past or future) in working the destruction of its
                        own life and previously accrued properties, and when we realize how hard it
                        has been for the average man to earn comfort, is it not evident that real
                        economy is to be sought, not in the old ways of investment of such sums in
                        adding more and still more gain to the waste, but rather to find how, in
                        peace, to stop frittering away such possible surplus without tangible
                        benefit in ways that do not make living better or easier on the whole; to
                        learn how hereafter the possible benefits from such an output may be adapted
                        to secure real welfare?</p>
                    <p>In the narrow fields of industrial competitive enterprises the quantitative
                        mind is already demonstrating ascendancy over the qualitative - as, for
                        instance, in economizing effort in certain phases of industrial management,
                        shop practice; yet the ultimate result may be nil if the thing accomplished
                        is not a means to the general betterment. I am convinced that half that
                        study applied to the simple workshop of every house would release half
                        humanity of half its burdens; but time is lacking to get into that study
                        here. There is as yet, however, little evidence of any definite progress
                        toward deliberately conserving efforts or resources in systematizing such
                        comprehensive undertakings as our communities, cities or countries which
                        comprise and control the whole of modern investment.</p>
                    <p>We should be aware that, at the root of the many fundamental difficulties of
                        distribution - such as, for instance, the wasteful distances over idle
                        valuable areas to a remote and difficult margin of cultivation - lie in the
                        current conceptions of political economy and the scope of the state; but
                        these must be passed over, for the proper concern of this Conference is only
                        in an intermediate physical stage of development; as a body we progress
                        through object lessons.</p>
                    <p>The examples of greatest value, because of widest application, can be sought
                        perhaps in the disposition of and accommodation for our</p>

                    <p>every enterprise and service, all rapidly expanding, and chiefly in the
                        cities. This is town planning. Of pictures, of literary enthusiasms, of
                        theories, we have heard a great deal in the town planning movement, but with
                        very small resultant improvement, partly because we are habitually floating,
                        more or less, in nebulous, if delightful, discussions over emotions,
                        esthetics, tastes and distastes - the innumerable abstractions and
                        glittering generalities that will not permit of quantitative comparisons or
                        demonstration of actual relative values for given expenditures on the land
                        for definite purposes. If this were not so we would be little distracted
                        over "classic," "medieval," or for that matter "modern" obsolete practices
                        in Europe, which cannot possibly serve as direct criteria of present town
                        possibilities here or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Disputations in the initial stages along lines apart from economic in such a
                        time as ours have, I fear, already postponed actual progress; and the coming
                        generation will have to learn that preparedness for meeting the new
                        community problems can no more grow out of general and erudite consideration
                        than could sculpture arise out of literary critiques. It must arise out of
                        experiments and progressive accomplishments in the art itself and their
                        demonstrated effectiveness - greater or less - and their mistakes. Criticism
                        can no better anticipate Creation than multiplicity of council can effect
                        it. I take it as accepted in the modern educational system that we learn to
                        do by doing. Advance is, consequently, to be expected only where greatest
                        freedom and scope to individual initiative are offered.</p>
                    <p>Coming to earth - say to give a piece of land for the smallest but most
                        general purpose, the dwelling, comprising as a class, three-quarters of the
                        city - we first of all find restrictions for the lot in its size, shape,
                        slopes, aspect, prospect, available materials, and the location and
                        appearance of the neighbors' nearest buildings; also the character and
                        position of their prospective improvements or detriments; and the more
                        definitely these are known, and the freer we are to plan, the better can we
                        avoid loss of space or works. Obviously, we</p>
                    <pb n="103"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 103 ====]</p>
                    <p>will be in a much better position to design for economy when one or more of
                        the adjoining elements can be planned, not to say carried out, at the same
                        time. Progressively, in multiplying ratio, the co-ordinate consideration of
                        the various elements in the community, even in the country, would eliminate
                        waste and loss - to what proportion of the £25,000,0000 a day no man can
                        measure now, for the first steps have scarcely yet been seriously attempted.
                        It has been computed that ten years necessary corrections of intolerable
                        evils, due to the lack of town planning in England, cost £30,000,000.</p>
                    <p>Some years attempting to build satisfactorily on single inside lots, under
                        various limitations, have led me to suggest that 60 feet width is a suitable
                        minimum for single or double houses; but such a generalization is only a
                        makeshift as compared with the sort of grouping which, I submit, should
                        obtain when the location of each residence and outbuilding is determined by
                        the physical conditions of the sites in a group to secure the maximum
                        advantage to everyone.</p>
                    <p>For example: in this pair of houses on two lots of 50 feet (Itte) and of 60
                        feet (Comstock (See Vol. IV)) the object of screening and protecting the
                        whole from the incongruous neighbors is accomplished in the first case by a
                        "T" and in the second by a "U" arrangement; and I can assure you, for
                        pictures cannot be conclusive, that in the midst of streets of houses on the
                        same uniform allotment areas and ordinarily lined up, these and similar
                        experiments have produced essentially the results of greatly augmented space
                        in every case, and created oases out of nothing in a desert of unmitigated
                        constriction. Certainly with three units, then four, and so on the openness
                        is not only extended to the larger group but further augmented by the
                        permutations and combinations then made possible.</p>
                    <p>I show, for example, groups of alternately projecting and recessed pairs at
                        the same time alternately opposed across the street and blocks:</p>

                        of functions is less and the organization not so complex.</p>
                    <p>As to business premises we might well now also conclude that a whole city
                        frontage between two street intersections is properly a single unit for
                        development; and in the most modern practice this has become the fact,
                        requiring no illustration, from the many department stores, public markets,
                        exhibition and industrial buildings and largest office buildings, as well as
                        public administration buildings. These with their immense scale and powerful
                        repetition have advanced far enough now as to point the way to a dignified
                        city whose architecture need not be lost in a maze of contradictory
                        fragments - for single fronts cannot accomplish architecture if it is an art
                        of three dimensions. Concentration of facilities and services, adequate
                        light courts, repetition of standard forms, avoiding bulky and often
                        duplicated duplication division walls, and securing convenience of internal
                        communication, have made such development so attractive that splendid
                        monumental modern skyscraping buildings, on one or several allotments, have
                        frequently been scrapped, after less than 15 years' life, to permit larger
                        and more profitable ones of no greater height.</p>
                    <p>Before it is possible to provide for all business in such units it is
                        certainly practicable that the shop front and canopied portion be forthwith
                        designed and carried out as a single feature for a block, in order to
                        overcome the very worst disfigurement that pervades Australian towns - the
                        tawdry, sheet-metal awnings that effectively divorce architecture from the
                        street. The paradox of effectively carrying massive walls of superstructure
                        on an uninterrupted base of sheet glass has only been overcome by the arcade
                        scheme such as the Parisian Rue de Rivoli, or the Grand Piazza at Venice,
                        where the most profitable</p>

                    <p>Some object lessons of proper individual occupancy are available; but as to

                        they are awaiting the development of a practical common sense of common
                        responsibilities. Nevertheless it is possible, within the range of feasible
                        individual land development, for new communities to compare the costs of
                        current practice with the alternative cost of carefully planned improvement,
                        and thus to show, as a corollary of the future general benefits, positive
                        increased profit that, when known to investors, will suffice to insure the
                        proper course for future undertakings.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Clark's re-subdivision of Janey's addition to Grinnell, Iowa,
                        No. 8, a glance at the rolling character of the ground shows how the
                        money-absorbing drainage problems arise out of a simple specimen of the
                        usual automatic extension of the gridiron plan of a city; and a comparison
                        of the alternatives also shows the simple means required to avoid all the
                        difficulties, by conforming the features to the natural topography for
                        proper grades without earthwork, producing sites everywhere high in respect
                        to their frontages and outlooks, yet all in strict order, in a parklike,
                        informal environment, and with routes accentuated with parks, but direct and
                        without barren deserts of pavements or objectiveless treadmill inclined
                        planes. There is, in addition, a neighborly system of inter-communication.
                        The most striking point, however, is that in the original subdivision there
                        were only 57 lots - thirty averaging 50 feet wide and 29 averaging 75 feet
                        wide - whilst as revised there are 66 lots of the same average depth but
                        with 64 of 75 feet width and only 2 of 50 feet width, the resultant area in
                        salable lots at the same rate representing an increase in value of
                        $10,500.00 - an increase in saleable frontage of 30.6 per cent over the
                        previously adopted ordinary subdivision.</p>

                        character of whose development can be illustrated by the finest type of
                        residences in that city, is one of a piece of land which,</p>

                        generation behind the growth of the town that was built out miles beyond;
                        whilst no one would risk any but industrial investment here, because of the
                        threat inherent in the essential exposure to the remainder of the tract. In
                        this case, the few owners, by combining and agreeing upon a single scheme of
                        development, under the landscape architect's control, were able to translate
                        the difficulty into the supreme advantage of a uniquely beautiful park,
                        available to all, and the highest values in the city for residential land
                        because of the joint benefits.</p>

                        of required lot frontage. As such an intensity as the 40 feet by 120 feet
                        lots of Roseland-terrace was considered too great for the location and
                        character of the Kugler tract the standard has been corrected for units
                        corresponding to the new subdivision lots averaging 60 feet by 140 feet.</p>

                        street supplies and the multiplicity of connections.</p>

                        whole city, offers a similar illustration when compared with an arrangement
                        on more liberal but systematic lines.</p>

                        appreciated from the fact that under such conditions it should at present be

                    <p>CAPTION. P. 73. GRINNELL SUBDIVISION. A comparison<lb/> The informality of
                        the rolling disposition is accentuated by the parklike character of the
                        roadways, paths and terminal parkings; all of which are in contrast with the
                        brutal mutilation of the natural advantages by the typical rectangular
                        extension, its expensive lots to be filled or graded down with abrupt and
                        steep grades and barren deserts of pavements, ungainly slopes to descend or
                        treadmill inclined plane to climb with no stimulus to the imagination in
                        prospect, monotonous views and staccato repetition.</p>
                    <p>That the differences in economy of equipment are real and very great no one
                        will deny. They were the inducements to this resubdivision; but also the
                        less tangible values accruing from the aesthetic attractions and the natural
                        adaptation of groups to the beautiful hill and vale which will induce an
                        influx to this property as the most desirable in Grinnell, disregarding both
                        these factors and merely looking at the proposition as a real estate man
                        wanting the greatest quantity of salable plots on paper, a comparison
                        between the two schemes is still startling as to the primitive, inexcusable
                        deficiency in our regulation procedure in property subdivision.</p>
                    <p>We find a total increase in the salable land area of Clark's Resubdivision
                        aggregating $10,500 as compared with the valuation of the rectangular
                        subdivision. In other words, the total increase in lots of the same average
                        depth as compared with the previous subdivision of the same tract amounts to
                        30.6%, the lots increased from 57 to 66 while minimum frontage is 75 feet
                        throughout whereas formerly half the lots approximated 50 feet frontage. The
                        houses drawn are to scale of houses built.</p>

                    <p>caption</p>
                    <p>GRINNELL RAVINES - IOWA</p>
                    <p>The resubdivision of Janey's addition to Grinnell, Iowa, was brought about
                        when, after some 8 lots had been sold, it became apparent that the sewer
                        problem of the old rectangular arrangement was about to involve an
                        expenditure entirely disproportionate to the whole undertaking.</p>
                    <p>The original plat consisted in a purely mechanical extension of the typical
                        layout that comprises the whole of the city which, although a rolling
                        prairie, has not in general quite the same degree of accentuation of the
                        hill and vale that characterizes this twenty acre tract.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of comparison of the two methods of platting we may disregard
                        the very obvious advantages of following the ravines with roadways by which
                        the excavation for the underground service equipment is merely a matter of
                        frost line; of lots uniformly high relative to the street and its outlooks;
                        and of that treatment whereby the informality of the rolling disposition is
                        accentuated by the parklike character of the roadways, paths and terminal
                        parkings all of which are in contrast with the brutal mutilation of the
                        natural advantages by the typical rectangular extension, its expensive lots
                        to be filled or graded down with abrupt and steep grades and barren deserts
                        of pavements, monotonous views and staccato buildings repetition, ungainly
                        slopes to descend or treadmill inclined plane to climb with no stimulus to
                        the imagination in prospect.</p>
                    <p>That the differences in economy of equipment are real and very great no one
                        will deny. They were the inducements to the undertaking of this
                        resubdivision; but disregarding not only these very obvious items but also
                        the less tangible values accruing from the aesthetic attractions and the
                        natural adaptation of groups to the beautiful hill and vale which will
                        induce the influx to this property</p>

                    <p>as the most desirable in Grinnell, disregarding both these features and
                        looking to the proposition merely as a real estate man wanting the greatest
                        quantity of salable plots on paper, a comparison between the two schemes is
                        still startling as to the primitive inexcusable deficiency in our regulation
                        procedure in property subdivision.</p>
                    <p>For instance taking the prices given to the original 57 lots at which rate 8
                        of them had been sold and had to be bought back in order to permit the
                        resubdivision to proceed, applying these values to the lots in the
                        corresponding location of the 66 parcels of the new resubdivision, we find a
                        total increase in the salable land area of Clark's Resubdivision aggregating
                        $10,500 as compared with the valuation of Janey's subdivision. In other
                        words, the total increase in lots of the same average depth of the Clark
                        resubdivision as compared with the previous Janey subdivision of the same
                        tract amounts to 30.6%. This latter frontage is so distributed as to
                        increase the total number of lots from 57 to 66 while the minimum frontage
                        is 75 feet throughout (except two 50 foot lots) whereas formerly half the
                        lots approximated only 50 feet frontage each and only the remaining 29
                        averaged 75 feet frontage.</p>
                    <p>The houses indicated on the plat are to illustrate its scale. Though not
                        intended for execution in this site, for construction is beyond the present
                        scope of this project, they are in fact plans of buildings erected elsewhere
                        in the practice of the architect, one instance being the house of Mr. B.J.
                        Ricker bordering the subdivision, a type for the upper level.</p>
                    <p>Flat roofed houses are eminently the right thing for the lower levels in
                        order not to obstruct the views of neighbors as well as for the use of the
                        occupant for wide views.</p>

                    <p>THE MENACE OF GOVERNMENTS - Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>Modern governments, those of historical times, have come about in one way
                        only - by the imposition of power of arms by a warlike minority on a
                        peace-loving majority, and always with the object of making the <hi
                            rend="ul">industrious</hi> hand over to the <hi rend="ul"
                        >predacious</hi> all but the means of keeping on with their labor.</p>
                    <p>Franz Oppenheimer <note>sociologist and political economist</note>, among
                        others, has taken the pains to find this out from facts after we have been
                        some thousands of years accepting mere theory and speculation as to the
                        State and its functions. This has given rise to such false ideas as the
                        "Republic of Plato," the "Social Contract" of Rousseau, the "Just Powers" of
                        Thomas Jefferson, the "Of the People" of Lincoln, the "Right of the
                        Majority," "The Greatest Benefit of the Largest Numbers" and similar
                        shibboleths. These now will all have to be discarded in the Light of Science
                        and the Facts of History.</p>
                    <p>POWER OF POLITICIANS, - Welfare by government means, in the end, only <hi
                            rend="ul">dictation</hi> by <hi rend="ul">politicians</hi>, who in turn
                        are the agents of the actual privileged classes whom governments serve.
                        Knowing politicians and officials and their habits, character and means of
                        place holding should be sufficient to forever preclude anything but grave
                        suspicion as to any real human welfare from such a source or under such
                        control.</p>
                    <p>John Stuart <note>Mill</note> says, - "The free development of individuality
                        is one of the leading essentials of well being..... it is not only a
                        co-ordinate element in all that is designated by the terms civilization,
                        instruction, education, culture, but it is itself a necessary part and
                        condition of all those things."</p>
                    <p>Samuel Butler says, - "I will live as I like living, not as other people
                        would like me to live." Mr. Bertrand Russell says, - "The greatest possible
                        amount of free development of individuals is, to my mind, the goal at which
                        a social system ought to aim."</p>

                        3, Aesthetic. But for suppression from without, each one normally is born
                        with a bent and capacity for specializing and excelling to the point of
                        "genius" in one or more of these directions, in which alone are the highest
                        satisfactions of human life to be found.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand no one of us could exist long without (1) some usefulness
                        or productivity; (2) some fairness, co-operation; and (3) some relaxation
                        through the five senses in expression of ease or grace in form or
                        expression.</p>
                    <p>These are all <hi rend="ul">fundamental</hi> elements of life, and
                        consequently in "Society." </p>
                    <p>The State, on the other hand, <hi rend="ul">has no concern whatever for these
                            fundamental elements of Society</hi>. In fact it must of necessity, and
                        through every avenue of its ramifications, oppose them in order to preserve
                        its own existence and serve its fundamental purpose which is <hi rend="ul"
                            >anti-social</hi>, <hi rend="ul">anti-economic</hi>, and <hi rend="ul"
                            >anti-aesthetic</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Where would the state come in, for instance, if economic forces were allowed
                        natural scope? No, indeed, the economic efforts of its subjects must be
                        curbed and cramped and twisted for "<hi rend="ul">National</hi>" benefit,
                        for the welfare, in fact, of a class or clique in each nationality or group.</p>
                    <p>Where, indeed, is there a State that could survive free play of ethical ideas
                        or the practice of ethical relations between all men? These must, therefore,
                        be and are of necessity opposed with all the forces of political propaganda,
                        public education and penal codes in the power of the government.</p>
                    <p>I would not say that the instrumentality of the State is consciously opposed
                        to aesthetics. It would be giving too much credit, in the democratic state
                        at any rate, to assume that the authorities so selected would know enough of
                        this high form of human endeavor to be conscious of its potency, scarcely
                        even conscious of its existence. Even the Czarist Government of Russia
                        overlooked this agency and suffered the death penalty for its oversight.
                        For, though it oppressed the</p>

                    <p>underlying population economically to the limits of its ability and bound its
                        intellect wisely in chains of ignorance and prisons of ethical orthodoxy, it
                        was insufficiently knowing to counter or circumvent a wonderful creative
                        spirit in its people in the fields of art, most particularly literature,
                        which finally effectively turned the minds of the people against it.</p>
                    <p>Here is the great lesson for us with regard to propaganda of reform. Few men
                        can or will listen to reason. Controversy will always divide them and is,
                        for that reason, the mainstay of the politicians and parties. Preaching is
                        offensive to "amour propre" and, consequently, penetrates but slightly. Only
                        the subtleties - art, the sensual satisfaction in form or expression, is
                        capable of getting under the protective armor of the average ego to affect
                        his ideas or ideals. Make no mistake, the elimination of the pernicious
                        power of the State to coerce and mold the people will come only through the
                        ablest writers, story-tellers, playwrights, scenario makers and picture
                        designers!</p>
                    <p>DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF GOVERNMENTS,- Governments are all distinguished by
                        one feature - the existence of a possessing and a dispossessed class with
                        regard to the economic basis of existence - access to the earth. This
                        classification is what supports the governments as they are and it is idle
                        to expect, therefore, that any of these governments will abandon its
                        foundation on privileged interests. Changing the form, the representation,
                        the personal have all been tried and always failed to effect the fundamental
                        change.</p>
                    <p>THE ROAD TO FREEDOM,- Now, however, that we have actual knowledge of the
                        essential function of government as it is, that operates to stifle the
                        development of the individual and, consequently, the advance of society and
                        mankind, it will only suffice to give that knowledge to the underlying
                        population. I have tried to show, too, the only way, in the face of the
                        difficulties of this situation, that a new idea may be implanted under the
                        skin of the ego.</p>

                        that have already worked it out will accept it; the others will oppose it

                    <p>The site of 18 acres, severed by a creek, and contiguous to Mason City, was
                        originally regarded as suitable for common-place building sites only. Walter
                        Burley Griffin, however, converted it into a center with ideal possibilities
                        for domestic architecture.</p>
                    <p>The creek is dammed to generate electric current.</p>
                    <p>By the relegation of the houses to the perimeter the area of gentle slope to
                        the river will be preserved indefinitely for open view very much as nature
                        designed it and for those purposes of retreat and recreation to which nature
                        has so well adapted it.</p>
                    <p>The endless fascinating possibilities for domestic architecture with the
                        unrepeated variations of view, soil, ruggedness, luxuriance, prominence and
                        seclusion, need only the due attitude of appreciation to work themselves out
                        in structures as unique as their sites, out into rock or perched on the
                        crest or nestled in the cove as the case may be.</p>

                    <p>ROCK CREST &amp; ROCK GLEN</p>
                    <p>Rock Crest and Rock Glen occupy the two sides of the valley which Willow
                        Creek has carved out of the rocks within three blocks of the central square
                        of Mason City, Iowa. In common with many such beautiful pieces of nature it
                        had been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of the
                        commonplace building sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems to be
                        approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently stimulated by
                        opportunity for unique development where long abuse has not been, as is
                        generally the case, coincident with the neglect. This example comprises 18
                        acres of the creek frontage between two bridges. That at the north is a
                        permanent masonry arch carrying an important thoroughfare route and fixes
                        definitely the boundary in that direction but the western foot bridge is
                        merely a temporary structure and its removal in the near future is promised
                        for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream of a territory where rock
                        and dell have still different forms of expression to be preserved and
                        respected.</p>
                    <p>The vertical bluffs of Willow Creek alternate from side to side of its
                        sinuous course. In the portion illustrated they comprise the south and west
                        banks, opposed by a gentle slope of meadow and open woods extending
                        gradually up to almost equal elevation north and west within the limits of
                        the tract.</p>

                    <p>EQUITY THE WATCHWORD</p>
                    <p>Suppose we Americans quit copying Europe and tackle our problems consciously
                        with the intention of solving them in accordance with our Western ways and
                        convictions and intentions.</p>
                    <p>Europe has tried one experiment after another which we have looked upon as
                        attempts to solve the social problem of our time. We are tempted to copy
                        them. But failure would meet us as it has them over there. We are faced with
                        a critical testing time and situation. Are we going to try Europe's methods
                        or are going to do as the founders of this country did and achieve real
                        creative thinking? In those days an independent America was established on
                        an entirely new concept, the concept that the function of government,
                        political government, was to maintain equity. Nowhere else is that the case
                        for the establishment of government to maintain the welfare of the people is
                        the diametric opposite of this and always leads to war.</p>
                    <p>The founders also put the choice of the executive in the hands of the people.
                        Nowhere else is that the case. The parliamentary form of government gives no
                        possibility of popular control and the powers of imperialism rest secure
                        behind this screen set up between the people and the permanent bureaucracy,
                        civil and military, and imperialism continues. No screened power can throw
                        out of office a president of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We are now witnessing in Europe a rebirth on modern lines of the same old
                        imperial sway which, always based on the liaison of political and economic
                        institutions, now recognizes the necessity of accepting modernism in
                        economic affairs. The liaison continues. Only the emphasis has altered. The
                        uniting of the conduct of economic affairs with the military, the police
                        (necessary for the maintenance of equity as the traffic policeman) spells
                        ruthless power. There is an alternative.</p>
                    <p>If Americans can grasp the correct concept of the founders of this unique
                        country, they will realize that the segregation of activities according to
                        function is necessary for health. If America</p>

                    <p>or the United States in unison with the whole of the Americas would accept
                        this basic idea and would segregate the functions of a community as the
                        functions of a human entity are segregated and build up appropriate
                        instruments for their functioning we could spread health and could attain
                        tremendous prosperity which could by its example facilitate establishing
                        health in the world. It is not impossible for a being to function in health
                        whether an individual or a community.</p>
                    <p>There can be no difference of opinion as to what are the functions of a human
                        community - Liberty, Equity, Mutuality - as in an individual we have the
                        needs of the Spirit, of the Soul and of the Body. As in the human being
                        these function through the mind, the heart and the stomach so in a human
                        community we need an organ for each. Any attempt to make one of these organs
                        do the work of another will result in illness in the human individual and as
                        inevitably in disaster in a community.</p>
                    <p>We are already beginning to see the necessity for an Economic Organization
                        and it is already apparent that this organ will naturally become a World
                        Economic Organization if we can keep the political organizations from
                        meddling in it except to maintain equity which is their function. Since
                        America has experienced a national organ based on Equity she is in a
                        strategic position to supply the initiative for a World Economic
                        Organization. The only alternative is totalitarianism, which ends all hope
                        for liberty.</p>
                    <p>With an Economic Organization functioning in America the principle of modern
                        economics - division of labor - could be made effective. With the
                        organization of all the groups and associations and elements of economic
                        life, producer and consumer, employer and employee, the problems of America
                        or the Americas could be so handled that prosperity would reach every
                        element, and an efficiency obtained not yet seen even in the United States,
                        and the world could be convinced of its necessity.</p>

                        into this field until the price came into balance with those of other
                        commodities. These laborers could be brought from those industries where
                        prices are too low, where there isn't enough demand to place its production
                        on a level with other commodities circulating in the community. They could
                        be trained if necessary in community institutions.</p>
                    <p>Through a complete economic organ this transition would be made simply
                        whereas with our present confusion it is impossible. A while ago when one
                        looked for a job it was a farmer's son who went out to open land, a man who
                        already knew something about farming, and so elsewhere. That is no longer
                        the case, but with a complete organization the transitions could be made,
                        the education and training supplied as the needs for change arose. Our
                        purchasers within our boundaries would increase by leaps and bounds, and
                        other communities would follow our lead till we had a World Economic
                        Organization and in the world as many real democracies as there were groups
                        of people who met the moral standard of believing in Equity in the realm of
                        Rights.</p>
                    <p>Should the Americas build up an Economic Organization of the Western
                        Hemisphere they could effect movements of people from the overcrowded fields
                        of labor without too great speed and without overriding individual
                        preferences and abilities, without anything in the nature of dictatorship or
                        oppression. See how the masses of America moved during the war time as great
                        new industries were developed. And what opportunities are offered in the
                        balancing of the now rival agricultures of the United States and Argentina.
                        With the offer of special training and higher wages offered many of these
                        could be diverted to fields less crowded where prices should be lowered.</p>
                    <p>With such an equitable system America need not fear a Nazi rival organization
                        for the former would continually increase in efficiency whereas the latter
                        resting on a bureaucratic system, though it might be very spectacular at
                        first, for during the early period it would draw into itself men trained in
                        private business with energy</p>
                    <pb n="122"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 122 ====]</p>
                    <p>and enthusiasm for efficiency, it would continually become less and less
                        efficient for that is the very nature of bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>Even in the intermediate period, if the Americas should readopt the wide-open
                        door policy, since wealth is a function of population, many individuals
                        would make their escape from the enslaved European districts to join the
                        planned economy which, when not planned and when controlled by the political
                        organ, would not be destructive of democracy. For democracy belongs in the
                        political realm whose task is to maintain Equity in the realm of Rights
                        whereas democracy, decisions made by a majority, is an absurdity in the
                        economic realm where under a system based on the division of labor all labor
                        is specialized. With our T.V.A. <note>Tennessee Valley Authority?</note>
                        supplemented by a M.V.A. and an A.V.A. and a St.L.V.A., etc., we could
                        easily and profitably absorb the whole population of Europe.

                    <p>MELBOURNE 50 YEARS HENCE</p>
                    <p>Will the Melbourne of fifty years hence be less beautiful than the Melbourne
                        of today? Should the people of 1922 try to plan more artistically for the
                        people of 1970? The question was suggested the other day when the chief
                        engineer of Water Supply for the metropolitan board of works, Mr. Ritchie,
                        drew a picture of Melbourne populated by 3,000,000 people in fifty years
                        time. With the growth of interest in town planning, the average man perhaps
                        with his sons will live in a finer and more majestic Melbourne than he
                        himself inhabits today. An interesting, but gloomier view however is taken
                        by Mr. W.B. Griffin the designer of the Federal Capital at Canberra. When
                        asked for his view of the future Mr. Griffin said:-</p>
                    <p>Personally I do not like to look forward to a tremendous increase of
                        population in this city, for one gets less out of life in a very large city
                        then in a comparatively smaller one. The main thing, after all, is to make
                        Melbourne a better city. As the years go on it will certainly grow bigger
                        and perhaps handsomer as far as the center of the metropolis is concerned.
                        But I do not think that it will be more comfortable to live in than it is at
                        present. Even with the electricity scheme in operation there must still be
                        more dirt, though. I think the city will be a commercial, social and
                        political nucleus rather than a huge industrial center. Its development will
                        be, perhaps, along lines of trade and of light manufacture rather than of
                        huge plants and extensive works.</p>
                    <p>Of course, with increase of population, larger buildings will have to be
                        erected, doubtless taller and more substantial, but I am not sure they will
                        necessarily be improved in appearance. It can hardly be said that the
                        buildings erected by the present generation are any improvement,
                        artistically, upon those put up by previous generations.</p>
                    <p>Considerations of expediency and quick return have been taking the place of
                        pride and satisfaction in expressing civic ideals, and so only in
                        utilitarian respects, I imagine, will the buildings of the near future be
                        better than those of today.</p>
                    <p>As regards the type of structure, it is evident that the trend of opinion
                        here today favors the reinforced concrete building, recent</p>
                    <pb n="124"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 124 ====]</p>
                    <p>examples of which may be seen in various parts of the city. The general
                        character of such buildings is likely to change very little in the course of
                        50 years, except in respect to scale and size which are artificially
                        restricted just now by arbitrary tax graduations.</p>
                    <p>It must be remembered too that the state and municipal building regulations
                        put a very strict limit upon any variation in design. To a great extent they
                        crystallize previous practice and attempt to put the new wine of the future
                        as far as possible into the old bottles of the past. Such attempted rigidity
                        can only tend to a greater and greater monotony and similarity, and less and
                        less individuality and experiment in the case of Melbourne buildings during
                        the next 50 years.</p>
                    <p>From the artistic point of view there can be no change for the better except
                        as a result of a change in the minds of the great bulk of the people
                        themselves and, candidly, I think there is insufficient indication at
                        present that the people are taking any interest in the matter, and of
                        leaders in thought on architectural and artistic development. I do not wish
                        to pose as a prophet but I do want to show the need for thinking in advance
                        if people want a beautiful city 50 years hence. To achieve such an object
                        they should be doing creative thinking even if not planning today. The
                        community is rather devoting its attention to the development of the
                        individual advantage and power, and does not take seriously the fact of any
                        real aesthetic needs, private or public.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, at the moment anyway, the influences making for beautification are
                        growing rather fewer, not only here but in most places afflicted with our
                        present political and industrial agencies for coercion and standardization.</p>
                    <p>I would like to see a better Melbourne in the future if not a very much
                        larger Melbourne. I would like to see many of the smaller buildings pulled
                        down, and more economic and efficient buildings erected in their place. But
                        I do not look with great favor upon the growing domination of government and
                        municipal authorities where</p>
                    <pb n="125a"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 125a ====]</p>
                    <p>building or other creative activities are concerned. The past score of years
                        witnesses distinct retrogression in public works and a tendency to
                        stereotyped design in every class.</p>
                    <p>So the Melbourne of the next half century may be only somewhat similar to the
                        city of today, possibly if not probably worse because more crowded and more
                        monotonous. This is only because the city and architecture are a reflex of
                        the life of the people. In modern life there is a growing tendency for men
                        to become, more and more, employers and place holders rather than self
                        dependent entities and independent citizens. Hence fewer minds are at work
                        upon the problem of improving conditions for the community. The very inertia
                        of bigness too makes the individual's effort so seemingly hopeless. The
                        result already apparent is that less and less active interest is taken in
                        the beautification or in any affairs that seem a long way ahead.</p>
                    <p>Sense of the beautiful, appreciation of finish and nicety in all things are
                        not compatible with continuous struggle of individuals or classes for
                        security from poverty, nor scramble for dominance, government billets or
                        monopoly, because all these efforts are too feverish, too impatient, too
                        anxious, too exhausting. So while they prevail the material expression of
                        our era will continue more and more to be the sort of thing we see about us
                        already.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, fifty years is a short time under modern conditions for aesthetic
                        revolution on a very large scale. Not much more than enough to make general
                        the accomplishment of things already worked out by individuals. Yet who now
                        has reached the stage of a constructive, comprehensive architectural ideal
                        for Melbourne? Such ideals in the mind of the far-seeing public-spirited
                        few, where they can be proven practicable, even profitable, will take on
                        eventually and it may be hoped that the next 50 years will see the
                        foundation at any rate of a really different and not merely greater
                        Melbourne for the time to follow.</p>
                    <p>Melbourne has a better opportunity than any other city in the</p>
                    <pb n="125b"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 125b ====]</p>
                    <p>world to prepare for the growth of population. It has the widest streets,
                        with space for recreation grounds around the center that can scarcely be
                        matched. Altogether, apart from the aspect of beautification, if foresight
                        is exercised, there is no reason why Melbourne should not escape in the
                        future much of the dangers and discomfort associated in other great cities
                        with crowded thoroughfares and dense and squalid slums.</p>
                    <p>Frequent suggestions for improvement along town-planning lines indicate that
                        civic spirit is not dead but has only been sleeping. The proposal of Mr.
                        James Alexander Smith before the Victorian Institute of Engineers to build
                        municipal buildings in the center of the city over the massed railroads
                        which come into Melbourne's only railway station has shown that the way to
                        the creation of a much needed nucleus of Civic Development without delay or
                        cost or disturbance of the rights or interests of any part of the public is
                        practical and only awaits the awakening of public spirit.</p>
                    <p>Of course there will be a tendency for the city to spread out with the growth
                        of new suburbs; and in this respect we are fortunate in possessing such
                        magnificent beach frontages. Many suburbs will spring into existence along
                        the bay. On the other hand, the natural beauties of ti tree groves as well
                        as of the hills inland will hardly be greatly enhanced by increase of
                        population. The opposite is likely to be the case, especially through the
                        week-end habit, which is steadily growing and curtailing the attractiveness
                        of much of nature among the gullies and bush covered hills.</p>

                    <p>2.11121. UNIVERSITY.</p>
                    <p>Of these two features, the University and Military Groups, the former is
                        recognised as of a more appropriately dominant character, and is aligned
                        with the terminus of the water axis at the foot of Black Mountain. The
                        situation of gentle undulation largely under the mount's lee having wide
                        scope, surrounded by the inherently most attractive region of the City, is
                        intersected by a little lagoon arm, bordered by the lowest lake, and at the
                        same time overlooks the entire length of the other four of the chain. This
                        site is also in a position to utilize the botanical gardens and mountain
                        with its forestry reserve.</p>
                    <p>The scheme of the Educational Group comprises the fields for higher education
                        that may be taken up by a nation recognising the enormous advantages and
                        economies in federating all the scientific, professional, technical, and
                        practical branches for both teaching and research.</p>
                    <p>Fundamental sciences, descriptive of nature, lead directly to the theoretical
                        sciences dependent upon them along lines of derivation and through these, in
                        appropriate combination, into the lines along which they are applied to the
                        work of civilization. Some such arrangement is necessary to permit proper
                        expansion in ever-changing fields, with convenience to students. Moreover,
                        it is endeavoured to direct these lines on the site to such openings for
                        actual application as are most available to them. Thus from Physiology, the
                        gymnasia give on to the broad flat athletic grounds and the water areas. And
                        the hospital, of itself in a most suitably isolated location with most
                        equable temperature and favorable atmospheric conditions, is adjoined by the
                        Medical, Surgical, and Pharmaceutic Schools. Thus Agriculture adjoins the
                        Botanical Gardens and the Forestry Reserve. Into the base of Black Mountain
                        extends Mining, while Engineering lies between it and Architecture — both of
                        which it serves — and has maximum of room for expansion; Pedagogy, Law, and
                        Commerce approach the Civic centre of people, courts, and offices.</p>

                    <p>Unity essential to the city requires for so complex a problem a simple
                        organism.</p>
                    <p>The factors consist in the advantages of the location on the one hand and the

                    <p>1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS.</p>
                    <p>The peculiar advantages of Canberra lie principally in the following
                        characteristics, with each of which is indicated the chief adaptability
                        recognised:</p>
                    <p>1.1. MOUNTAIN RANGES</p>
                    <p>Beautiful blue and snow-capped peaks of the Australian Alps, counted among
                        the leading natural features of Australia, lie to the south and west,
                        properly sunlit for the scenic background.</p>
                    <p>1.2. LOCAL MOUNTS</p>
                    <p>Ainslie, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, rising almost 700 feet (too lofty and
                        too exposed for building purposes), afford objective points of prospect to
                        terminate great garden and water vistas, with conspicuous positions for
                        future commemorative monuments, and conversely offer points of outlook over
                        a city arranged in an orderly way with reference to them.</p>
                    <p>The isolated conical aspect of Ainslie and its alignment with two central
                        eminences on the opposite side of the Molonglo suggested the lesser one of
                        these vistas. The apposition of Black Mountain, with the general direction
                        of the waterway and the broad prospect of the Queanbeyan Plains to the
                        eastward, suggest its transverse and more marked vista opening or axis.</p>
                    <p>1.3. HILLS AND SPURS</p>
                    <p>Eminences rising to 200 feet furnish most appropriate public building sites
                        to terminate main thoroughfares disposed with reference to them and often in
                        apposition with the mountains also. The natural contribution of elevated
                        foundations that may be treated in a variety of ways, formal and informal,
                        is an asset for architectural impressiveness not to be wasted. These hills,
                        however, are not considered to dictate either the public buildings, sites,
                        or main thoroughfare lines, except in the light of other determining
                        factors.</p>
                    <p>1.4. MOLONGLO RIVER AND FLOOD BASIN.</p>
                    <p>The considerable central flats are unavailable for building purposes, but
                        eminently suitable for a waterway of the largest extent that would be
                        consistent with a location in the heart of the city, where only, on the
                        other hand, a water feature of the restricted size procurable at Canberra
                        can maintain a dignity in keeping with its purpose.</p>
                    <p>The practicability of maintaining a surface of 5 square miles of water is
                        verified by all known data, provided proper precautions are taken in the
                        head waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Moreover, there are
                        additional river supplies available within the limits of expense
                        proportionate to any unprecedented or possible need.</p>

                    <p>1.5. VALLEYS</p>
                    <p>The open alluvial fields, flat or undulating, are most suitable for ordinary
                        purposes of industry and habitation.</p>
                    <p>Within the site these areas are practically all swept by the dominant winter
                        westerly winds, since only heights of the scale and abruptness of Ainslie,
                        Pleasant Hill, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, or Red Hill afford appreciable
                        protection to narrow skirtings, which occur in no considerable case within
                        the city limits. Not more than one-sixth of the official site can be
                        considered so protected, and that in instances too scattered and too rugged
                        for development for general purposes. Such protection can only be
                        accommodated in suburban extensions to be provided north and south as
                        illustrated in the original premiated plan.</p>
                    <p>However, experiment with winds of the ordinary winter velocity on the
                        Australian plateau indicates that a moderate amount of easily effected tree
                        growth will afford sufficient protection for situations such as even the
                        most exposed on this site, a fact further attested by the generally
                        acknowledged attractiveness for habitation of the tops of spurs extending
                        west from Capitol Hill.</p>
                    <p>As an initial deterrent to occupation, the wind may be discounted by the
                        present local experience, wherein temporary settlement has been created in
                        an area — possibly the most wind-swept of all — with very slight or no tree
                        protection. Here the first permanent residence has been located after ten
                        months' residential experience in a tent on one of the most exposed points,
                        commanding, however, the mountain view.</p>
                    <p>The slopes north of the river basin comprising the flat areas having the
                        finest prospect of the mountain background, and of central dominating sites
                        for the most important public architectural group offer the greatest scenic
                        advantages, and are to be given preference for the most general industrial
                        and domestic functions for the democratic purpose of "the greatest good for
                        the greatest number."</p>
                    <p>Taken altogether, the site may be considered as an irregular amphitheatre —
                        with Ainslie at the north-east in the rear, flanked on either side by Black
                        Mountain and Pleasant Hill, all forming the top galleries; with the slopes
                        to the water, the auditorium; with the waterway and flood basin, the arena;
                        with the southern slopes reflected in the basin, the terraced stage and
                        setting of monumental Government structures sharply defined rising tier on
                        tier to the culminating highest internal forested hill of the Capitol; and
                        with Mugga Mugga, Red Hill, and the blue distant mountain ranges, sun
                        reflecting, forming the back scene of the theatrical whole.</p>

                    <p>2. FUNCTIONS.</p>
                    <p>The importance of classifying the purposes of the city lies in the fact that
                        only by proceeding from generals to particulars, from the more essential to
                        the lesser essential, and from the ends desired to the means for obtaining
                        them are natural relationships established.</p>
                    <p>The generalizations are derivable from tendencies of actual growth in modern
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>2.1. OCCUPATION.</p>
                    <p>The advantages the city offers to the various classes of occupants who will
                        reside in and utilize its spaces constitute its reason for being. The
                        various kinds of occupation have divers needs to be met as to area,
                        position, and environment. Secondly, their accommodation requires a
                        communication system — the social means of linking up these elements.</p>
                    <p>2.11. PUBLIC GROUPS.</p>
                    <p>From the stand-point not only of general interest, but also of effective
                        control, the character of fixed occupancy divides primarily into two
                        branches — public and private. In the Capital City the former takes
                        precedence, and is treated in a very broad way, because extension of
                        functions may easily go beyond any present basis of expectation. Simplest
                        possible arrangement on the most general lines of classification are adopted
                        at the start to ensure both room for expansion and a constant coherence.</p>
                    <p>The general arrangement of Public Functions in this plan is illustrated in
                        the accompanying scheme, in which they are first separated into those
                        appurtaining <note>appertaining?</note> to the Federation as a whole, and
                        those concerning the City merely.</p>

                    <p>2.111. FEDERAL GROUP.</p>
                    <p>Because of unity of control all Federal improvements can be made to
                        contribute to a single dominating group, and since these buildings and
                        spaces can be assorted into four distinct classes, Governmental,
                        Recreational, Educational, and Military, these four are established to form
                        the structural bounds and terminals of two co-ordinate axes.</p>
                    <p>The unmistakable pre-eminence of Ainslie and Black Mountains ordained them
                        for apposition with such axes, to which the site contributed further
                        opportunity in the general direction of the Waterway, extending towards
                        Black Mountain at right angles to a line joining Ainslie with the most
                        prominent spur of the opposite range, "Kurrajong," and with a lesser
                        eminence between, "Canberra Hill," directly at its front.</p>
                    <p>The co-ordinate axes disposed accordingly are not with the cardinal points of
                        the compass, which would entail 25 per cent. building frontage without
                        beneficial sunlight, nor with the diagonal points where, for part of the
                        day, no shade could be found; but they lie midway between these extremes.</p>
                    <p>They are not primarily thoroughfares, but give a connected park or garden
                        frontage for all the important structures, and can be developed, as in the
                        case of the Mall at Washington, with scope for artistic expression, little
                        hampered by utilitarian limitations, affording the greatest ease and comfort
                        for observation of the capital.</p>
                    <p>In general, this arrangement of all the Federal buildings on heights about
                        two co-ordinate axes, their individual groups, set off and connected by
                        formal water basins, forms one combination of parallel set buildings, to
                        which the possible confusion of other enterprises must ever remain
                        subordinate.</p>
                    <p>2.1111. PRIMARY DIVISION.</p>
                    <p>The two more general and earlier developed functions of the Federal Group
                        will be Government and Recreation.</p>
                    <p>2.11111. GOVERNMENT.</p>
                    <p>Representative Government in all its ordinary functions is to be classed as
                        deliberative and limited, and is properly stationed, in a Capital, in an
                        accessible but still quiet area. On the basis of the two lines hereinafter
                        designated "Water Axis" and "Land Axis," it is a simple matter to allot to
                        the commanding Capitol the highest spur on the land axis mentioned as
                        suitable for building purposes, "Kurrajong," and to locate the Parliament
                        Houses on the lower offshoot, "Canberra Hill," on the same line towards
                        Ainslie. Other Departmental buildings bounding a water court of the next
                        lower terrace extend to a solid terrace front of buildings and to still
                        lower boulevarded embankments along the central basin of the co-ordinate
                        water axis.</p>
                    <p>Centrally located, the Capitol is focused in an extensive hill park, and at
                        that has a limited function, either as a general administration structure
                        for popular reception and ceremonial, or for housing archives and
                        commemorating Australian achievements rather than for deliberation or
                        counsel; at any rate representing the sentimental and spiritual head, if not
                        the actual working mechanism of the Government of the Federation.
                        "Kurrajong" is deemed too large and too high for a convenient working
                        organization of Parliament, but, being the only conspicuous internal
                        eminence that has a skyline visible from practically every portion of the
                        city, it lends itself to an architectural treatment that need comprise
                        little more than in the necessary ramps, stairs, and terraces for outlook to
                        make it, by its natural bulk, the dominating architectural feature.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the views command not only the entire city, but, through gaps, the
                        Yarralumla Valley and mountain chains of the Murrumbidgee watershed, the
                        most spectacular features of the landscape, and the irregularity and variety
                        of the hill slopes afford ideal surroundings for an isolated Capitol
                        structure, and most appropriate setting for the two official residences,
                        those of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <pb n="134"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 134 ====]</p>
                    <p>However, the possibilities of the site are not limited to this recommendation
                        as to the Governor-General for immediate adoption, and though a large park
                        may be connected by private unintersected low level open passage-way from
                        the central position, and extend as far as may be into the hills to the
                        west, forming a domain, it is entirely practicable to locate the Government
                        House itself in the latter area, as alternately provided for, still
                        maintaining parallel, axial, architectural affiliation with the Capitol.</p>
                    <p>The whole group of Government buildings is directed out from the one popular
                        point along lines of sequence in function. The fact that Parliament is in
                        two "Houses" is an incident in addition to the topographical situation that
                        precludes making of that structure a focal feature.</p>
                    <p>The plateau stretching between Kurrajong and Canberra Hill provides
                        sufficient foreground from the former to set off the Parliament House on the
                        latter, over which, however, the court of the Departmental Buildings on the
                        next terrace below may yet be seen, while the view beyond is uninterrupted
                        across the Basin, and the water front of the Public Gardens and along a
                        broad plaisance to Ainslie. Parliament Building, on the edge of Canberra
                        Hill, has an elevation of 50 feet above the succeeding plateau, and is
                        approached therefrom by wide ramps around the fountain end of a terrace
                        reservoir. From this terrace court of the reservoir the Parliament edifice
                        has thus a lofty setting, stopping the long axis of the reservoir, crowned
                        by the lofty Capitol behind, and supported on the flanks by the lower
                        Departmental Buildings.</p>
                    <p>The ensemble presents excellent opportunity for cumulative massing.</p>
                    <p>The central terrace court of the Government Group lies 35 feet above the
                        lowest terrace, from which it is separated by the buildings along the
                        waterway frontage, but to which access is given by ramps at ends and flights
                        of steps between the structures.</p>
                    <p>The court terrace, however, is carried on the roof of a central building of
                        the waterway embankment, which projects into the Basin, crowned toward the
                        water by an open colonnade, surmounting a slight bank of steps to afford an
                        open forum, beneath which the structure serves as a launch entrance or
                        "Water-gate."</p>

                    <p>2.11112. RECREATION.</p>
                    <p>The Governmental Group silhouetted against the dark forested hills is best
                        seen from the other arm of the land axis, where most appropriately may be
                        located the public gardens, essentially the show places of the City. This
                        recreational function of the Commonwealth Capital will appurtain
                            <note>appertain?</note> to the people directly as distinguished from
                        their representatives or agents or servants. It is, therefore, to be
                        situated rather directly in communication with the congregation centres, and
                        tributary to the homes of the people, than connected with any other Federal
                        Group. The Circular Pools and connecting Basin of the waterway essentially
                        belong to this group, and are adapted, by their continuous boulevarded
                        embankments, for a continuous motor route, and for water sports, pageants,
                        and bathing, the central Basin incidentally forming a rowing-course of 1
                        mile between terminal bridges.</p>
                    <p>The Stadium for general assembly faces the waterway, and is recessed into the
                        slope of the bank, where it does not interrupt the continuous vista along
                        the land axis. The Theatre and Opera House, on either side, are reached from
                        the municipal avenue on one hand, and from the boulevard of the water front
                        garden on the other, for maximum accessibility from the residential
                        districts. Farther to each side of the land axis are paired Galleries of the
                        graphic and plastic arts; the Museums for natural history and archeology;
                        the Zoological Gardens and the Baths, and Gymnasia; all together affording
                        for the business and residential districts an appropriate front to
                        correspond with the governmental aggregation on the other long side of the
                        central Basin.</p>
                    <p>Recreation comprehends, also, a formal plaisance 600 feet wide, all the way
                        to the Casino, a park feature, at the foot of Mt. Ainslie, with ramp drives
                        to points of vantage on the slopes overlooking the whole city and
                        surrounding country, and setting off such commemorative national monuments
                        as may be appropriately most conspicuous.</p>
                    <p>Maximum effectiveness for the waters is attained by widening as much as
                        possible between the necessary bridges.</p>
                    <p>The Molonglo is left in its present state in the lower channelled reaches,
                        where it forms a feature of the botanical gardens and forest reserve
                        continuous with Black Mountain, incidentally perpetuating there the only
                        remnant of primeval luxuriance on the city site.</p>
                    <p>Here, a dam, so located as to combine with one of the road crossings,
                        impounds at 1825 elevation the lower outlying lake, and the triple internal
                        architectural lagoons bounding on three sides the Governmental Group,
                        reflecting the buildings, augmenting humidity and aiding equability of
                        atmosphere in the heart of the city.</p>
                    <p>Another weir, with locks, on the line where the railway and a main traffic
                        route pass around the Government Reservation, inundates the extensive upper
                        bottom lands for a naturalistic lake at 1835 level, practically coincident
                        with the highest recorded flood.</p>
                    <p>The circular pools and their connecting basin provide three lagoons, each
                        complete in itself, and all located in spaces between the direct lines of
                        communication joining focal centres. At the same time, because of their
                        largeness of scale and severe simplicity, the lagoons conform to the
                        architectural character of the centre of the City, where any informal pond
                        would be ineffective.</p>
                    <p>Stepped and gently sloping embankments at slight comparative expense offer
                        better architectural possibilities and greater utility than the more
                        ordinary vertical revetments.</p>
                    <p>The two irregular lakes located as is the case of the formal lagoons without
                        intersecting the direct lines of communication have an informal treatment
                        that corresponds with the park-like, irregular character of the City's first
                        suburban zone and of the more spacious recreation grounds facing them.</p>

                    <p>2.11122. MILITARY.</p>
                    <p>The upper reach of the water axis has no commanding terminal short of the
                        blue hills of the Dividing Range, bounding the outlook from the City over
                        the Queanbeyan Plains, where a spacious public park is allotted to one side
                        of the upper lake, and on the other are the grounds of the present Military
                        College, with the steep bald knoll of Pleasant Hill — the highest crest
                        within the City — their most conspicuous feature. This may be crowned either
                        by a future development of the Military College, or, citadel like, given
                        over, together with the adjacent slopes, to the Military Post, with its
                        armories, arsenals, drill-halls, and barracks, commanding the railway lines,
                        overlooking the entire City, and flanking the gap eastward towards the sea.</p>
                    <p>2.112. MUNICIPAL GROUPS.</p>
                    <p>Buildings of the Municipality, those public edifices of utility to the people
                        of Canberra as a whole, afford further opportunity for extending the
                        harmonious public grouping of the parallel-set system of the Federal Groups,
                        by establishing a subordinate axis adjoining the Recreation Group, which is
                        most nearly analogous to the general community functions.</p>
                    <p>Two separate characteristics distinguish these municipal utilities — first,
                        that of the official, clerical, and administrative class; second, that of
                        the material handling, transportation, and merchandising class; and it would
                        tend to congestion to concentrate such conflicting though equally important
                        general functions in one centre. Two centres, therefore, are fixed as the
                        terminals of a municipal axis in the form of an avenue, north of and
                        parallel with the water axis, each terminus connected with the garden and
                        water feature of the latter axis, by short park arms leading from the
                        circular pools. The essentially city functions are not only tributary to all
                        the inhabitants, as is the Recreation Group, but are to serve handily the
                        great Federal enterprises, which are here located in close proximity in
                        three cases, whereas connexion with the great</p>
                    <pb n="136 and 137"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 136 and 137 ====]</p>
                    <p>Government focus is direct, and access to its Departmental Groups reasonably
                        close. The two sites made use of for the Municipal Centres are the important
                        and isolated hill "Vernon" and the slopes of like elevation lying between
                        two terminating hills a mile and a half to the eastward, and equi-distant
                        with "Vernon" from the great land and water axes. These two sites afford for
                        comprehensive treatment very different, but equally unusual, architectural
                        opportunities to develop large structure groups, rising in pyramid and
                        amphitheatre formations respectively.</p>
                    <p>2.1121. MUNICIPAL OFFICES CENTRE.</p>
                    <p>The former of these points is assigned to the administration of urban
                        affairs, public and private, where, grouped around the City Hall or
                        Administration Block, are the General Post Office, Criminal and Civil
                        Courts, Banks, and allied institutions.</p>
                    <p>2.1122. MUNICIPAL MARKET CENTRE.</p>
                    <p>The interval to the second of the municipal centres is considerable, to allow
                        for indefinite expansion of both, which are equally accessible from the
                        railway, from the Capitol, from the residential sections, and especially
                        from the agricultural and industrial suburbs. At this second point are the
                        Central Station and the Public Produce Markets.</p>
                    <p>2.12. PRIVATE GROUPS.</p>
                    <p>As we have learned through some phases of the generally baneful "gridiron,"
                        there are advantages in rectangular plots, and in orderly alignment of
                        private, as well as of public, building groups.</p>
                    <p>The remarkable parallel in the respective needs of industry demanding
                        publicity; and of habitation requiring seclusion from the stand-point of
                        occupancy; with the needs of circulation for business and of distribution
                        only for access to retired districts, from the stand-point of communication,
                        makes feasible an harmonious organic arrangement without conflict between
                        street and plot requirements.</p>
                    <p>Between the arms of the grand axes of public groups, private buildings are
                        allotted separate systems of co-ordinate axes, determined by as many
                        different base lines as are needed to interconnect directly the main public
                        features and all lesser specialized centres.</p>
                    <p>Though these axes are routes and governed largely by circulation
                        considerations, each line commands a view of terminal objectives, either
                        natural or artificial, and each system of co-ordinates offers rectangular
                        sites for all buildings up to a point of junction with the next similar
                        system, while even at these intersections no acute angles are permitted, for
                        triangular buildings are as expensive as they are irredeemably ugly. But the
                        allowed obtuse intersections afford a quadrilateral site disposition, as
                        economical as the rectangular type, with two long prospects at each sweep of
                        the cross connecting or ring streets.</p>
                    <p>The angle blocks are, as a rule, less adapted for formal than for informal
                        and picturesque treatment, and excepting immediately around the focal
                        centres, were the completed plan figure is manifest, they occur at the very
                        points of least communication and formality, and of greatest areas and
                        cheapest land, where an informal treatment is easiest and most appropriate.</p>
                    <p>2.121. INDUSTRY.</p>
                    <p>The industries of this Capital City, aside from those institutions which have
                        been provided for in the Public Functions which are the primary purposes of
                        the Capital may be considered to be relatively simple in requirements,
                        because the character of the location does not indicate very large or
                        special industrial growth.</p>
                    <p>The principal operations are assumed to concern the internal demands of the
                        population, and they will be either general for the whole community or for
                        its main subdivisions, or local for the immediate needs of residents.</p>
                    <p>2.1211. FOCAL INDUSTRY.</p>
                    <p>The former class can be referred to as Focal.</p>
                    <pb n="138"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 138 ====]</p>
                    <p>2.12111. URBAN UNITS</p>
                    <p>The more central focal units will naturally be the urban ones, whose
                        influence will extend over the entire city area, but the disparity in the
                        kind of traffic, as well as housing, between the two principal urban
                        functions distinguishes one as administrative, and another as mercantile, a
                        difference which has been recognised in the separation of the two public,
                        official, and marked centres. The line of demarcation between governmental
                        and private control of these urban activities will tend to be indefinite and
                        variable, with changing standards of community consciousness so they
                        naturally, together, form single groups.</p>
                    <p>2.121111. THE ADMINISTRATIVE FOCUS.</p>
                    <p>Contiguous with the Municipal Official Centre may, therefore, be found the
                        private offices and financial institutions, stock and insurance exchanges,
                        chambers for corporate enterprises, and the professions.</p>
                    <p>2.121112. THE MERCANTILE FOCUS.</p>
                    <p>To the Railway Station and Produce Market Centre will naturally be attracted
                        private general mercantile establishments in the larger units, particularly
                        wholesale, together with "goods clearing," transfer systems, warehousing,
                        and light manufacturing.</p>
                    <p>2.12112. SUBURBAN UNITS.</p>
                    <p>Suburban centres, situated at points topographically most available, but at
                        some distance from the heart of the city, are established to help fix the
                        internal routes and give some idea of the extensive application of
                        principles of planning, with specialized direct connected centres, and with
                        building sites, rectangular so far as possible, varying in utility from a
                        maximum to a minimum of accessibility.</p>
                    <p>It is advisable to determine lines of extension as far ahead as possible, as
                        has been done in many German cities, generations in advance of occupancy, to
                        prevent ultimate obstruction of orderly growth through misdirected
                        improvements. Five of these suburbs were indicated in the first premiated
                        competitive plan, one to be devoted to society congregation, three to
                        agricultural pursuits, and one to manufacturing.</p>
                    <p>In this preliminary draft of the internal city site the originally suggested
                        lines of approach to outlying suburbs have been maintained.</p>
                    <p>Considerable elasticity must necessarily be allowed for in the designation of
                        outlying centres, because of the remoteness of the anticipated period of
                        occupancy.</p>
                    <p>2.121121. INITIAL TOWN.</p>
                    <p>To meet special conditions imposed by the necessity of occupancy south of the
                        Molonglo, in advance of construction of bridges, or the extension of the
                        railway across to Yass, there are introduced three local nuclei tributary to
                        a preliminary railway line already laid down.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that there will be a population of 10,000 or 12,000 before
                        the advent of Parliament, and it is possible that the extension of the
                        railway may not come until after that time. Therefore, these initial centres
                        will permit of a completely organized small town, not merely for
                        construction forces, but for a variety of interests.</p>
                    <p>This district is plotted to correlate intimately with the Public Groups, its
                        central co-ordinate axes being parallel, securing the same advantages of sun
                        exposure, and disposed to benefit fully from the upper circular basin water
                        frontage through opposition with the ultimate Urban Mercantile Centre on the
                        north side.</p>
                    <p>2.121122. SOCIETY SUBURBS.</p>
                    <p>To meet the objection of wind exposure on the bare western side of the City
                        the residential area is contracted into the valley lying inside that
                        bounding range of hills, dominated by "Shale," which are to be given over to
                        an afforestation park.</p>
                    <p>Two points of congregation accentuate the two natural topographic outlets
                        west of the Capitol.</p>
                    <pb n="139 and 140"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 139 and 140 ====]</p>
                    <p>These residential centres might well be characterized by society, clubs, and
                        church assemblages for that large social group of special character peculiar
                        to a national capital. The conformation of the land tributary to them is
                        irregular and most advantageously divided into the larger estates, while the
                        Yarralumla Valley to the west, unintersected by railway and least in demand
                        for industry, and the informal lake at the north, afford open areas for a
                        maximum of outdoor life. The proximity of the University may also be counted
                        to afford an attraction, as exemplified in university towns and intellectual
                        centres throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>2.121123. AGRICULTURAL SUBURBS.</p>
                    <p>Outlying village centres to the southward, or possibly to the northward, in
                        either case in the lee of the only protective mountains of the site may be
                        devoted, at least in some transitional stages of the City's growth, to
                        horticultural and intensive agricultural uses, truck gardens, nurseries,
                        poultry raising, &amp;c., occupying alluvial plains adaptable to sewage
                        irrigation from the higher inhabited regions, and being directly tributary
                        by rail transportation, and by road, to the Markets. At their centres
                        facilities for creameries, abattoirs, and allied operations are to be found.</p>
                    <p>2.121124. MANUFACTURING SUBURB.</p>
                    <p>The centre lying to the northward of the City was originally designated
                        "Manufactures," but conditions in the early growth, with the railroad
                        facilities limited to the south of the Molonglo, may necessitate that such
                        activities be concentrated in one of the southern suburbs. Furthermore, it
                        is possible that the summer northerly winds may render the northern point
                        less acceptable than a southern one for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>2.1212. LOCAL INDUSTRY.</p>
                    <p>In addition to general business in the immediate neighbourhood of the
                        specialized Urban and Suburban Industrial Foci there can be anticipated a
                        development of business for more local distribution to, and accommodation
                        of, the intermediate areas generally utilized by residents. Such business,
                        necessarily attracted by easiest accessibility will tend to align itself on
                        the most direct of the avenues connecting the focal centres.</p>
                    <p>These industrial alignments may be assumed to include in some instances, not
                        only the wide main thoroughfare frontages, but also, as an elastic limit,
                        the frontages of the first and longest parallel avenue on either side.</p>
                    <p>The unit blocks on the long connecting avenues are narrowed by the amount of
                        increase in front traffic accommodation, these avenues being at least twice
                        as wide as others, and also by the introduction of a rear alley shipping way
                        30 feet wide.</p>
                    <p>It is contended that modern and prospective means of street transportation in
                        the tramway and fast vehicular traffic, and of which the great progress up
                        to the present is hardly a beginning towards speed, safety, noiselessness
                        and reliability in sight for the near future, mean a very different and far
                        more general lineal distribution of ordinary retail trade than where a
                        walking range has been the determining influence.</p>
                    <p>During the transformation period congestion has resulted in cities, and the
                        lift or elevator pressed into service for relief. An equally well
                        administered tram service, perhaps supported financially in the same way out
                        of rents, would assure a more convenient, as well as far better horizontal,
                        alignment.</p>
                    <p>2.122. RESIDENTIAL SECTIONS.</p>
                    <p>With the Federal needs provided for in their special districts, and with the
                        general industries amply accommodated at focal points, and along the direct
                        lines connecting them, the remaining portion of the city site is available
                        for domestic life, which demands privacy, quiet, and stability, with freedom
                        from either interference or encroachment of business life. Because of the
                        triangular or rhombic arrangement of their traffic-line business boundaries,
                        these internal areas, while secluded, may yet be but a few steps from the
                        industries and communication lines serving them. Equitably distributed
                        throughout the city these quiet sections allow domiciles to be everywhere
                        handy to industrial employment.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 141 ====]</p>
                    <p>2.1221. DOMESTIC COMMUNITIES.</p>
                    <p>Comprising the proportionately large share of the city area required for
                        habitation, the segregated sections, formed and separated by the general
                        traffic lines, furnish not only suitable individual home sites, but comprise
                        social units for that larger family the neighbourhood group, with one handy
                        district school or more for the children, and with local playground, game
                        fields, church, club, and social amenities accessible without crossing
                        traffic tracks, or encountering the disturbing elements or temptations of
                        business streets, since these family activities may best be directed
                        internally toward the geographical centres of their groups for their special
                        congregation. In other words, the adult and independent industrial social
                        activities may be considered typically directed centrifugally, whilst the
                        domestic social efforts are assembled centripetally for effective control
                        and co-operation.</p>
                    <p>The innermost unit block may be varied to form considerable areas for such
                        special purpose, including also sanatoria, residence hotels, parks,
                        ornamental or industrial horticultural gardens, even to the extent of
                        agricultural fields, farms, or wilds in earlier stages of settlement, all
                        with the minimum of interference with the traffic of the city as exemplified
                        in the lakes and parks of large groups, occupying the whole of similar areas
                        which are devoted to special Capital uses.</p>
                    <p>2.1222. HOMES.</p>
                    <p>The desirability of rectangular blocks and parallel-set buildings, in the
                        interests of economy of construction and restfulness and simplicity in
                        architectural treatment, is scarcely less in the case of residences than for
                        public or industrial groups, so where topography permits a system of
                        rectangular blocks is preferable, especially where, as in this plan, it is
                        by no means an expression of the "gridiron," because of its universal closed
                        vistas and innumerable street terminal sites. The reduction in the
                        repetition of unit blocks in one line marks here their independence and
                        seclusion, also permitting a graduated increase in the proportion of land
                        used individually to that demanded by communication.</p>
                    <p>The internal blocks, typically large, in many cases forming considerable
                        undivided areas, leave opportunity for private development or
                        small-community initiative to evolve pretty schemes of driveway subdivision,
                        recessed courts, closes, quadrangles, terraces, common gardens, irregular
                        hill garden subdivisions, and a host of similar possibilities, adding
                        incident and variety to a consistent whole.</p>
                    <p>For the sites among the hills, while an informal regularity or block
                        arrangement might, in some cases, be possible, it is not deemed so
                        necessary, since where allotments are large and houses are on different
                        levels, more picturesque juxtaposition is permissible. It is regarded as
                        generally desirable, however, that the occupied sites be higher than their
                        communication lines for enhancing their appearance, their utility, privacy,
                        and individuality.</p>
                    <p>2.2 COMMUNICATION.</p>
                    <p>The general communication system, finally, often irrespective of merely
                        aesthetic conditions, accomplishes the industrial success or failure of a
                        city. But this does not imply the attaining of a maximum of communicating
                        lines so much as their thorough correlation and suitable allocation. The
                        scheme must be simple and flexible, available with varying conditions of
                        expansion and the changes of condition with time; it must be detrimental to
                        the shape or orderly relationships of buildings, or to the natural beauty of
                        the landscape in no case that is avoidable.</p>
                    <p>2.21. EXTERNAL ROUTES.</p>
                    <p>2.211. RAILWAYS.</p>
                    <p>The line of railroad approaching from either way, all junctions being
                        external, is directed toward the Capitol as it comes into view, and then
                        diverted in passing the Public Buildings Group, to avoid bisection of the
                        internal traffic. The railway is, however, in immediate contact throughout
                        with all the industrial and general habitation areas, with frequent local
                        stations for freight or passenger accommodation. It is to be noted that the
                        regions not in direct touch are those of the specialized characters
                        preferably least intruded by the disagreeable features of dirt, noise, and
                        sight, incidental to railway operation, and in general are those prepared to
                        utilize the private motor car for rapid communication.</p>
                    <pb n="142"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 142 ====]</p>
                    <p>Gradient is the easiest possible, being virtually a level throughout, with an
                        appropriate 1/2 per cent. rise to the main station, facilitating starting
                        and stopping. Trackway in general is straight, with but four slight turns of
                        three degree curvature, suitable to long train traction. Thoroughfare
                        through flat districts is maintained by open depression about 12 feet deep,
                        the excavated materials forming embankments of 6 feet in height, an
                        elevation requiring but slight incline for crossing streets, and used by the
                        parallel roads where adjacent.</p>
                    <p>Through industrial regions the railway is conducted between occupied blocks,
                        for switching, warehousing, &amp;c., utilizing a flattish valley on the
                        outskirts for freight marshaling and car storage yards for which a
                        considerable area is to be set aside where interfering least with through
                        street lines.</p>
                    <p>The line, approaching the Urban Administrative Centre from the north, turns
                        at a local station there, and is directed toward a cathedral-crowned hill,
                        into the lowest slope of which it passes as it turns and enters the
                        Mercantile Centre through a subway beneath the open square in front of the
                        Main Station.</p>
                    <p>Spurs here afford stub-terminal train tracks for each direction at the sides
                        of the station not served by the through tracks.</p>
                    <p>The Main Station, of hexagonal shape, commands the place, but lies at one
                        side of the city traffic currents, and is beautifully ensconced, owing to
                        the hilly conformation at the rear. It is disposed to be conspicuous from
                        distant points, and to offer a dignified commanding prospect of the City for
                        the arrival's first impression. To minimize the difficulty of early
                        completing so ambitious a station centre the street arrangement is designed
                        to permit diversion of the approaching avenues at greater distances from the
                        focal point than intended ultimately.</p>
                    <p>Due south from the station, the railway emerges from the subway, and follows
                        a direct line from Ainslie and the Cathedral, crossing the waterway at
                        junction of basin and lake, continuing between wide avenues to the southern
                        Suburban Station, finally turning out of the city with the Capitol and Black
                        Mountain in its wake.</p>
                    <p>In general, this external communication line is treated with the dignity
                        accorded to internal lines, has its well-marked objective at every turn, and
                        is afforded the finest view points where crossing each of the axes of the
                        dominant architectural <hi rend="it">ensemble</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Because this through traffic line may be some years in eventuating, and in
                        order to effect a saving, at the outset, of the long weir bridge, it is
                        considered that possibly the local branch from Queanbeyan, serving as a
                        constructional line during the creative period, may be so plotted as to
                        serve ultimately as a rapid transit adjunct to the main railroad route,
                        linking in the Government centre with the northern and southern suburbs.
                        This, however, can only be suitably accomplished by a line that can be
                        concealed in the steeper slope of the hills approaching the Capital,
                        crossing the river in a specially designed bridge with the track level
                        beneath the roadway, with still enough room below the latter to clear the
                        boulevarded river embankment. This branch, necessarily largely in tunnels,
                        and with its limited ultimate functions permitting of relatively sharp
                        curvature, affords access to Parliament House and the Industrial Centre of
                        the initial City so close as to obviate any need for street vehicles to eke
                        out the journey. Perhaps such additional rapid transit facility with a clear
                        way, independent of the street traffic, might ultimately play part in the
                        healthful dissemination of the Capital settlement.</p>
                    <p>Though not indicated, a feasible route can be laid down for the extension of
                        lower level railway facilities to the west and south should seemingly
                        improbable conditions ever demand such. The isolated Yarralumla Valley will
                        scarcely justify a long distance rail connexion.</p>
                    <p>2.212. ROADWAYS.</p>
                    <p>Existent external roadways are relatively unimportant, but are accommodated
                        by through routes connecting with all the outlet gaps.</p>
                    <p>2.22. INTERNAL ROUTES.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the internal system in general, it is unnecessary to elaborate
                        here the provision for storm water disposal and drainage equipment, further
                        than to note that the grades and the general utilization of the depressions
                        for thoroughfare simplify the reticulation problem. The transverse
                        interception of storm water at various levels is also facilitated.</p>
                    <pb n="143 and 144"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 143 and 144 ====]</p>
                    <p>The Molonglo banks and bed afford an apparently economical route for final
                        outfall lines.</p>
                    <p>A complete local pipe and wire service at the street building line, obviating
                        stubs or pavement interference, is attainable with the roadway system of
                        control advocated.</p>
                    <p>For tramway equipment elasticity is a first requisite, guaranteed by the
                        integral system of arterial thoroughfares wherein there is allowance for
                        ultimately depressing in open channels an economical sub-surface scheme of
                        rapid transit.</p>
                    <p>2.221. CIRCULATION SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>Considering our problem from the stand-point of "Occupancy," there has been
                        noted modern tendency to supplement largely, if not to supplant the spot
                        concentration of older towns with long alignments of traffic and trade.</p>
                    <p>The maximum facility for uninterrupted rapid transportation and an adequate
                        equipment with services in the arterial system accentuates the tendency,
                        while a strictly subordinate arrangement of feeder streets deters traffic
                        diversion, cutting off competitive inducement to traffic and trade as well,
                        for trade must be where the people are. The direction of the main routes is
                        involved in selecting their terminals, those points of natural or functional
                        eminence, which must be inter-connected as directly as is compatible with
                        the possibility of following easy and uniform gradients, never greater than
                        2 1/2 per cent., without excavation unduly expensive in proportion to the
                        advantage sought. The desirability of straightness can hardly be
                        over-estimated, but with it no convex profile is permissible. Whereas,
                        however, these long lines are but few in the aggregate, because of the
                        concentration of the circulative function, the value of their proper uniform
                        grade and alignment for safety of operation, directness, and view of their
                        important and attractive objectives, in the organic city, constitute an
                        operative economy at least comparable with the demands of ordinary railroad
                        lines, having infinitely less traffic burden, and infinitely greater
                        distances and difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The basic circulation system comprises the triangle connecting simultaneously
                        the three business centres of Government activity (Government, University,
                        Military) and the two urban centres of local business (Administration and
                        Merchandising). On this framework the City can develop all its functions
                        from the beginning of its maturity with ample latitude for variation in each
                        phase of activity, maintaining the final scale of a Capital City from the
                        outset. Increments of gradual growth may be definitely, little by little,
                        incorporated without confusion, congestion, or scattering along later
                        extensions of the arterial systems, followed by corresponding distribution
                        tributaries as required.</p>
                    <p>Never less than triple roadways can be considered sufficient to handle avenue
                        traffic ultimately, with tramways, fast and slow vehicles in both
                        directions; but, in the early projection of these avenues, it will be well
                        to substitute park treatment or even to permit temporary private garden
                        occupancy of the portions not immediately needed for traffic.</p>
                    <p>The street area, if reduced to three roadways, is a desert, dangerous and
                        unpleasant to traverse, so in a sunny country of stately open-branched
                        broad-leaf evergreen avenue trees, additional space is required for a final
                        arboreal accompaniment of at least quadruple rows and supplemental shrubbery
                        parkways for shade and shelter, wind and dust arresting. From considerations
                        also of architectural setting, ventilation, fire stop, command of crossings,
                        and eventual rapid transit, a uniform width of 200 feet is adopted.</p>
                    <p>2.222. DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>A system of distribution at right angles to the circulation thoroughfares
                        gives minimum of distance from either side of such thoroughfare. For access
                        to public transfer lines, trams, &amp;c., this is the prime object. With
                        a frequency of the circulation ways the distances are short; indeed, a point
                        five blocks back in the triangular interspaces of this plan is a rarity.</p>
                    <p>The rectangular form of block most generally adapted to improvements, and
                        straight roadways most simply kept and patrolled, can, in these purely
                        distribution routes, be readily maintained with very slight modification for
                        a considerable undulation in site since these streets essentially short in
                        any one direction permit obstructions to remain or to be compassed by
                        diverting ramps without loss of utility, while general and frequent
                        variations in rate of slope can be accomplished at angles without rendering
                        the irregularity apparent or disagreeable.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 145 ====]</p>
                    <p>The very liberty and topographic adaptability permissible to these minor
                        distributing streets demands a contrasting dignity and severity in the
                        connecting avenues that form the backbone of the system, and for that
                        dignity the economy of the former easily contributes the requisite funds.</p>
                    <p>The streets parallel to business avenues decreasing in length, in
                        accessibility, and in importance in direct ratio with their distances from
                        their main axial artery, approach by degrees an ultimate of enclosed courts
                        best adapted for privacy and quiet, tending naturally to maintain themselves
                        for residential and similar purposes against any possible intrusion of
                        business, especially since they are only reached from the main travel routes
                        by ring cross streets that neither connect important points nor ever run
                        directly in any one way for sufficient distance to attract active traffic.
                        There are, however, no "dead ends" nor "cul de sac" streets expensive to
                        serve.</p>
                    <p>The gradual reduction of the proportion of thoroughfare area to private
                        grounds in residence sections adds materially to the site space available
                        for use as well as to economy in service equipment pipes and wire lines,
                        pavements, and their maintenance.</p>
                    <p>One suburban town observed, where alternate cross roads as laid out were
                        omitted, leaving blocks 1,200 feet long, may be cited as having been able to
                        perfect its street improvements, many years ahead of other places of similar
                        conditions otherwise, but with the greater multiplicity of streets.</p>
                    <p>In the hilly sections the distribution lines take the form of sweeping ramps,
                        confined, as far as possible, to the depressions for reasons heretofore
                        explained, as well as for economy in the grading pipe service, drainage,
                        shelter, and in the utilization of land that is of minimum value for other
                        purposes. This way is also the simplest and least conspicuous in mutilation
                        of natural rugged types of scenery. Effort has been directed towards
                        securing arcs of the minimum curvature needed to compensate an appearance of
                        varying and convex grades for economy as compared with straight lines in
                        such locations, and for directness, safety, and ease of control as compared
                        with short curves.</p>
                    <p>A uniform width of 100 feet for distribution ways is established as a
                        suitable minimum interval between building fronts for light, air, privacy,
                        and fore-garden embellishment. It is by no means a determinant of the
                        desirable thoroughfare space in roadway, walk, or public parking, which
                        should be graduated to a minimum requirement of possibly a 12-foot driveway
                        alone in the farthest backset, short streets, or ravine climbs. There is no
                        reason why the balance of the potential right of way should not be granted
                        for fullest use to the private occupants and considered in all but reserved
                        jurisdiction as belonging to individual abutting allotments, withholding an
                        easement for direct service lines adjacent to the buildings, and retaining
                        the exercise of considerable public control as to appearances. This is not
                        an uncommon arrangement and one here allowing variable increase in the
                        proportion of private sites to actual public ways directly corresponding to
                        lesser unit values of the areas for fixed occupancy and their lesser demand
                        for access.</p>

                    <p>UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY</p>
                    <p>GENERAL PLAN</p>
                    <p>The consideration governing a scheme for extension, indefinite both as to
                        time and magnitude, must be most general, and primarily concerned with
                        co-ordinating two phases of unity; the abstract functional relationship, and
                        its physical expression; otherwise:- The Educational Organization, and the
                        Architectural Ensemble.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="ul">EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION</hi></p>
                    <p>The conception behind the modern university comprehends a complete laboratory
                        of the farthest advanced and most fundamental scientific knowledge that we
                        possess wherein that knowledge is not merely being systematized and taught,
                        but where it is constantly widened and extended by the efforts or both
                        faculty and students into the practical work of our civilization. Such an
                        ideal excludes nothing from the curricula, except purely speculative and
                        dogmatic fields, and can be bound neither by historical nor arbitrary
                        limitations as to the things that are properly cultural, professional,
                        artistic or merely practical, for no phase of life in this era may be
                        permitted long to lie outside the pale, or be simply subject to rule of
                        thumb.</p>
                    <p>Primarily then the schematic basis of the University must be some general
                        arrangement of all our activities. To illustrate, I append an attempted
                        gradation from generals to particulars as suggested for a National
                        University at the Capital. Some such system, taking no account of relative
                        proportions and little of physical disposition, must be our sole guide prior
                        to the definite determination of the physical possibilities and limitations
                        of any University and should not be lost sight of amidst all the confusing
                        details and modifications that must be continually admitted. Otherwise
                        unity, elasticity and undiminished convenience, which are the very ends
                        aimed at, will be jeopardized.</p>
                    <p>In the Capital instance, wherein not only the University but the entire
                        environment might be deemed flexible, a fundamental scheme is quite fully
                        applicable not merely in the restricted area of the University itself but to
                        obtain correlation with appropriate natural features surrounding</p>

                    <p>the site and, as well, co-operation with important allied functions of the
                        city. In Sydney the environment is, to all intents and purposes,
                        established, and firmly located and the direction of their dependent
                        features, if not finally fixed, at least narrowly restricted, but the
                        principle of successive zones from General to Descriptive, thence to
                        theoretical and finally to Practical Work, can be observed in regard to the
                        allocation of each line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">GENERAL WORK</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the main building we have now a splendid center on the highest point of
                        the site appropriate to house for a long period all the strictly general
                        work:- Administration, Assembly, Library, Museum and the comprehensive
                        collective studies, such as Geography and History. Already the groundwork of
                        Practical Science - Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, has been properly
                        allowed for in an addition to west as planned for by the late Col. W.L.
                        Vernon to replace the present obsolete accommodations on the indicated
                        location.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">PRIMARY DIVISIONS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Presumably Astronomy in the absence of suitable atmospheric conditions for
                        observation will have to be supplied with its equipment at some separate
                        locality and the phases of that study required here will be of the nature of
                        General University work associated with Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Premising a main division of Science into four branches of which Astronomy is
                        the first, it is most practicable on this site to allocate the three
                        remaining great groups around the general point of origin as follows:-
                        Geology to the West, Biology to the South, and Anthropology to the East, a
                        disposition conforming so far as major buildings are concerned to present
                        actual operation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">GEOLOGICAL GROUP</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The earth science in its first or descriptive phase, Geology, must of course
                        be located in as close touch as possible with the general studies and, in
                        advanced stages even, this is not of less use to allied</p>
                    <pb n="149"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====]</p>
                    <p>technical branches than to Engineering which, strictly, may be taken to be
                        the adaptation of terrestrial materials and forces to man's use.</p>
                    <p>Again, Geology is most intimately related as to data and facilities with
                        another general division of science - Biology, hence both fundamental
                        studies should be brought in together toward the radial center from their
                        present isolated and circumscribed locations. Geology with its phases of
                        Physiography and Meteorology, is thus available to all the Biologic groups
                        as for instance Agriculture, as well as Medicine.</p>
                    <p>Engineering in its many branches and particularly because of operations using
                        power requires the most extensive scope and considerable segregation for
                        which the westerly direction in which its accommodation and its work are
                        already tending is the most suitable because of traffic facilities from
                        Parramatta Road and by reason of being the lowest point of the whole
                        University.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">BIOLOGIC GROUP</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Medical School is, by far, the most definitely determined of the now
                        scattered phases of the study of Physical Life, and lying on the Eastern
                        boundary of the grounds of the University, it is not inappropriately adapted
                        to its relation, as one of the most specialized of the applied practical
                        sciences, for with the Fisher Library as the focus for all, there is
                        intermedial room for the more fundamental general students' work. Physiology
                        just to the south of the library furnishes thus a point of demarcation for
                        the Pathologic work to the east, and the, yet to be established, Hygienic
                        branches with central Gymnasium and Stadium to the south, where is found the
                        most eligible natural amphitheatre for Athletics, directly accessible to the
                        public by tram, and appropriately associated, on the one hand, with Victoria
                        Park, which is expressly reserved for recreation, and on the other with the
                        Colleges, wherein many of the students are quartered for their leisure time.</p>
                    <p>A great central campus for ordinary individual games, as well as for general
                        drills and outdoor pageant and ceremonial, is also directly</p>

                        paraphernalia of the Gymnasia.</p>
                    <p>The relation of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to the Pathologic center,
                        hardly close enough, is improved by a direct connecting avenue.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of the available vacant land inside the University block lying
                        south of the central open area may be utilized as required by the
                        agricultural branches extending to the West as far as is compatible with the
                        needs of Engineering, either branch of technology utilizing the wider
                        latitude as time and circumstances, impossible to forecast, may determine.</p>
                    <p>In case of all the technological branches those operations, which, in fact,
                        approach the actual practice, and in which the students may concentrate in
                        long periods, or even whole days, are to be located farthest from the
                        general center.</p>
                    <p>If Military Science is to be treated at the University in its technical
                        aspects, its equipment properly will be placed at the west of the campus
                        connected with the Biological group and in contact with Engineering.</p>

                    <p>For a concentration of the studies related to humanity the eastern arm of the
                        site may be adapted as gradually as the specialities outgrow their
                        accommodation in the present main Administration Building, or as they may be
                        brought in for the greater advantage of co-operation from the outlying
                        situations more expedient on the present scale.</p>
                    <p>Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology are quite fundamental to all science
                        and art and may be indefinitely left in the Academic center whence the
                        aesthetic, ethic and economic branches should be elaborated in future
                        separate schools for Literature and Art, Law, Business and Education. This
                        last for which a large Teachers' Training School is now under construction
                        will be advantageously transferred to the more suitable site in the Eastern
                        group where also it will be convenient to actual local practice schools both
                        common and technical at a distance of a few hundred feet to the north.</p>

                        as well as the men is essential to maintain usefulness. Particularly for the

                        and space for the Women's Union immediately north, similar to that accorded
                        to the present Men's Union, is indicated.</p>
                    <p>Residence quarters and religious headquarters for various groups of students
                        are most properly reserved on the perimeter of the University as has been

                        have too greatly restricted the number of these groups and encroached on the
                        room now obviously needed for University expansion.</p>
                    <p>Since, however, the overlapping interests lie almost wholly in unused
                        portions of the lands for which any imperative need can only develop on the
                        part of the parent institution, it is less real than nominal and capable of

                    <p>Architecturally the prime object in the scheme is conservation of (a) the
                        site characteristics, (b) the architectural resources. This implies making
                        to count as a part of a coherent whole each element of construction, each
                        bit of space.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The chief advantage of the whole property lies in the beautiful central
                        valley, flat for some twenty odd acres, surrounded by heights rising from
                        60' to 70' on all sides except a rather narrow outlet diagonally to the
                        north-west and two flattish branch vales on the south side one, low, at the
                        western and one, higher, at the eastern end with a 60 foot hill between
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The highest spot of the grounds, just north-east of the main flat is occupied
                        by the first and most important University quadrangle building of which the

                    <p>The other large buildings, one the Medical School, the other the Teachers'
                        Training College under construction, give directly onto the low lying area
                        and, due to the central positions, east and north respectively, determine

                    <p>The preservation of the deep valley as open as possible in the form of a
                        "Campus" is necessary to secure an adequate spaciousness for the final plan
                        consistent with a full and compact building development on the basis of
                        fire-proof construction. Encumbrance of the bottom land with buildings,
                        except on the edges, would be as subvertive of health and of comfort as of
                        aesthetic attractiveness.</p>
                    <p>Onto this large area of lawn and bordering shrubs, flowers and water gardens,
                        all the other open spaces are planned to look as terrace, like gallery
                        loges.</p>
                    <p>Indeed the chief motive in the grouping throughout is a system of
                        interdependent but distinctly individual ample outdoor rooms:- cloisters,
                        slopes, quadrangles, courts or squares whose encompassing buildings, where
                        not prevented by previous constructions, are each accorded four broad quiet
                        outlooks, the successive rises as the sites recede from the campus
                        foreground serve to form these groups into a terrace-stepped cumulative
                        architectural composition, complete and impressive from many view points.</p>
                    <p>On the same principle Victoria Park is planned with an open center securing
                        much greater utility in unintersected recreation space as well as a
                        dignified and spacious appearance, giving most effective lawn setting for
                        the beautifully silhouetted English Gothic Buildings of the eastern front of
                        the University.</p>

                        functions. To assure however the preservation of the simplest relationships
                        between all buildings and building groups whose precise dimensions and
                        disposition must remain for a long time undetermined and subject to
                        considerable elasticity, their locations are fixed in each case on the
                        general plan by intersecting axes.</p>

                    <p>The major axis of the whole open terraced arrangement extends clear through
                        the University from the central tower of the Medical School to the middle of
                        St. John's College at the top of the western hill side, also fixing the
                        center of the simplified Victoria Park directly opposite the Medical
                        Building to their reciprocal advantage.</p>
                    <p>Intermediate to the lofty structures at the ends, three other building sites
                        are reserved on the long axis where, at lower elevations successively toward
                        the campus, flat roofed buildings, not too high in themselves, may set off
                        and enhance the effectiveness of these terminals.</p>
                    <p>The fine hill to the south of the campus is opposite the large Teachers'
                        Training School structure each bound for all time to be the dominating
                        features respectively of the south and north sides. The Training School set
                        parallel to the Engineering Building, is unfortunately at a perceptibly
                        divergent angle with the rest of the main buildings, but by forming the
                        north frontage of the campus into an arc of terraces it is possible to
                        rectify in effect the variance from a proper minor axis at right angles with
                        the major.</p>

                    <p>Colonel Vernon's arrangement of the proposed Physics and Chemistry group
                        skillfully overcomes the original deviated alignment of the Engineering

                        development of a series of courts on an Engineering Axis whose adjustment
                        elsewhere to the main system and another irregularly placed recent building

                    <p>of a few rounded walls imposed on future individual building plans in
                        harmony, however, with the informal style already fixed for this portion of
                        the University. It will be highly desirable on account of the irregularity
                        of the slopes to divert the present straight west main avenue of this group
                        to an easy curve, horizontal as well as vertical, westward from the point of
                        marked change in grade, and this turning point provides a most suitable
                        terminal site for the Russell monument where it may signalize that portion
                        of the University with which the benefactor's name will always be
                        associated.</p>
                    <p>The higher portions of the north Technology groups are already set on natural
                        undulating slopes, but the lower frontages toward the campus are adapted,
                        for other reasons than the necessary arc base line, to regular terracing.
                        For instance, the towering Fisher Library is a marked objective worthy of
                        maximum emphasis which can be obtained by a formal avenue directed toward
                        its west bay.</p>

                        from their now designated uses. Of these, the New Training College seems to
                        be eminently adapted by its large light rooms to the general lecture and
                        drafting work which constitute the basis of much of the Engineering

                        is left here for a development that will cover a transition to the
                        heterogeneous hospital and diagonally disposed features in the direction of

                        there is a space south and south east for separate flanking buildings which
                        will improve its setting though encroaching somewhat on the margin of

                        large enough for all exhibition playing, as well as recreative practice.</p>
                    <p>The expansive lawn thus afforded will serve to set off from the third side

                        screen off the cluttered effect now so evident in that direction. The
                        central element of an enriched chapel, the vista stop of a main campus
                        avenue, set off by long severe wards, offers an architectural opportunity to
                        accomplish economically the desired harmony with University architecture.</p>

                    <p>It is regrettable that the same Pyrmont sandstone employed throughout the
                        earliest and most stately edifice has not been adhered to as a veneer
                        facing, at least, for the later buildings, but the effort to establish more
                        or less segregated courts is a means to reduce the incongruity of varied
                        materials. At any rate, the eastern extensions can be carried out through
                        the future in the same manner and material as the original.</p>
                    <p>There is no question, moreover, that the Engineering group which is
                        particularly isolated and will be effectively screened by the future campus
                        development, should be carried out as stated, primarily in brickwork and
                        with its own simplified Gothic treatment.</p>
                    <p>But for the central campus whose elements are undetermined except in the case
                        of the Teachers' College, lately commenced, it should be feasible to
                        approximate more closely to the original type of University design. Even if
                        brickwork must be admitted generally, still it is possible that a very
                        simple treatment, on the order of St. Paul's College, for instance, would
                        make practicable the continuance of the stone facing for at least the inner
                        tier of buildings only the eastern most of which will be actually required
                        for some years.</p>

                    <p>DISTINGUISHED AMERICANS</p>
                    <p>What distinguishes Americans from other people?</p>
                    <p>Not nationality, that is not birthplace though the Earth itself places its
                        mark on the physique and physiognomy of man as well as other creatures and
                        if Americans let themselves be dominated by these earth forces they will
                        gradually become the American - the American Indian - type. We can see this
                        here and there if we are observant of these things.</p>
                    <p>Not race - that is folk characteristics - for America is the meeting place of
                        all folk of the world who through the social institutions established by our
                        fore-fathers rapidly form friendly and even closer relationships, which
                        means that Americans swiftly become human beings, individualized entities,
                        no longer under bondage to any folk spirit.</p>
                    <p>Not eccentricity, that is peculiarities that pick him out as conspicuously
                        different from his associates, in contradistinction <note>Spelling taken
                            from the N-YHS copy</note> to free will used to take the responsibility
                        of making one's own decisions in all realms of life and blaming no one but
                        oneself for the consequences, that Freedom which makes man alone capable of
                        choosing what he does not want.</p>
                    <p>But taken on the whole Americans, by and large, are distinguished by their
                        interest in <hi rend="ul">achievement</hi> as versus <hi rend="ul"
                            >accumulation</hi> of property. They are even gamblers willing to lose
                        and to lose heavily in the game of achievement versus profit. Let us be sure
                        that this flaming interest in achievement is passed on to our descendants.
                        The scope for achievement is endless, in America, in the Americas, in the
                        world, in the worlds of matter and soul and spirit. Let us make it the job
                        of our institutions to see to it that opportunities in all these realms are
                        wide open to every individual American. We need not fear, if we do it all
                        humanity will do it for human beings are inspired by the <hi rend="ul"

                    <p>ONE HALF PLAN</p>
                    <p>In Mr. Wilder's development we have one block of practically level land in
                        one of the western suburbs of Chicago not so close to the city as to make it
                        advisable to make lots smaller than 100 feet by 150 feet keeping it a high
                        class residential group. The property is the size of two ordinary blocks of
                        the town, one street coming to a dead end at the property. The four
                        surrounding streets are the usual residential roadways. With the customary
                        alley omitted we get an interior park 300 feet wide and 1200 feet long under
                        the control of the citizenry of the residences surrounding it, 26 families,
                        its equipment - tennis courts, ball fields, wading pools with their sand
                        beaches and so on.</p>
                    <p>Maximum garden feeling is attained by arranging the houses in pairs or
                        staggering them to make effective ensembles. The interior park is more or
                        less screened by borderline plantings.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>By eliminating the last block of a stub end street and the alleys, this
                        interior park with all its advantages became possible supplemented by the
                        outlooks gained by staggering the buildings.</p>
                    <p>In a small town the shorter block which was a stub-end street is eliminated,
                        doing away with one thoroughfare. The subdivision is in larger lots
                        appropriate to the less crowded district in an outlying town.</p>
                    <p>The interior space becomes useful as play space for young and old. With no
                        fixed building line every house can have outlook in all four directions.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>On his first visit to Canberra (1913) Griffin noticed <note>The phrase
                            "without use of instruments" has been crossed out.</note> that there was
                        an error in the location of the trigonometric bases which affected the main
                        land axis of his plan and consequently made the location of the corner stone
                        laid at the dedication incorrect. The location of this monument off the axis
                        did not bother him as he preferred a double monument, one on each side of
                        the axis, as a town planning feature and plenty of occasions would offer for
                        a second monument. But it was important that the surveys on which the plan
                        was based and on which all working drawings would be made should be correct
                        so he called the attention of the chief surveyor, Mr. <note>Charles</note>
                        Scrivener, to this error.</p>
                    <p>Griffin was appointed as Director of Design and Construction of the Federal
                        Capital in 1913 and took over his duties in May 1914.</p>
                    <p>Before leaving for his 6 months absence he requested the Minister <note>of
                            Home Affairs?</note> that surveys should be made of the outer districts
                        encircling the Capital so that the avenues of the city might be made
                        properly to connect with their extensions into and across the rural
                        districts. On his return he asked for these surveys which he found out
                        unofficially had been completed, but it was months before he got them. The
                        Minister's repeated requests and instructions for immediate delivery of the
                        surveys were of no avail so that actual working drawings, street locations
                        and grading could not be done at this time.</p>
                    <p>After working for some time on working drawings he became convinced by
                        comparing various surveys that there was something wrong and on
                        investigation found that the datum co-ordinates on the two sets of surveys
                        were different though there was no indication of this on the lithographs.
                        This meant great loss of time, entire revision of drawings and calculations.
                        In spite of such handicaps however the work of making drawings at a scale of
                        200 feet to the inch was continuing in Griffin's office.</p>

                        thrown out of office as the Party which awarded him the prize had previously
                        been thrown out) was the demand for a complete working plan at 400 feet to
                        the inch, a scale neither sufficiently small to work on as a whole nor
                        sufficiently large for the development of works.</p>

                        got the barest glimpses, only such as suited official purposes and of which
                        Parliament knew practically nothing until Griffin succeeding in getting the
                        correspondence laid on the table shortly before the end of Mr. Archibald's
                        Ministry; and much of which was unknown even to Griffin since he knew
                        nothing of the officer's letters and reports to the Minister except as he
                        could surmise it by the course of events. The officers refused to recognize

                    <p>Yes.</p>
                    <p>6565 - When you included the fact in Digest No. 17 did you regard it as an
                        intimation of the acceptance of that plan?</p>
                    <p>Yes.</p>
                    <p>6566 - On the 6th Dec. 1913 Mr. Bingle wrote to the Administrator as
                        follows:- The Minister said I could forward copies to Mr. Scrivener and
                        yourself. I understand they are to be published shortly. On the 12 Dec. the
                        Administrator replied - Many thanks. Two copies received one of which has
                        been handed to the Director of Commonwealth Lands and Surveys. Would those
                        letters refer to the copies of the accepted plan?</p>
                    <p>I think so.</p>
                    <p>6567 - I suppose that you hardly thought there was room for doubt after the
                        publication in the Digest as to the acceptance of that plan?</p>
                    <p>There was no room for doubt as to the fact of my having accepted the plan.</p>

                    <p>The document which Mr. Bingle stated there was no record was disclosed by the
                        Royal Commission in 1917. It is included on page 12 of the papers No. 346
                        presented by Mr. <note>King</note> O'Malley in 1917 containing copies of the
                        documents omitted from the papers presented to Parliament by Mr. Archibald
                        at the request of Mr. Kelley in 1915 (i.e., suppressed by the officials when
                        Parliament demanded the documents). The Minister, Mr. Archibald, also stated
                        during the interview in regard to a question raised by Mr. Griffin as to his
                        duties, that he wished first to receive his plan as above mentioned, and
                        after considering same he would than define Mr. Griffin's duties. (No
                        misunderstanding the nature of this threat.)</p>
                    <p>In Digest No. 20, 1st March, 1915 Mr. Archibald said:- Further action awaits
                        submission by Mr. Griffin of a plan on such a scale and with necessary
                        information as will <hi rend="ul">enable the Minister to consider its
                            adoption for the purpose of the layout</hi>.<lb/> (This 17 months after
                        Griffin's appointment.)</p>
                    <p>Griffin made the following protest on the whole question on 11 May, 1915:- In
                        justice to yourself and myself I would ask that the House, before proceeding
                        to consider the issues in relation to the Federal Capital, be made cognizant
                        of the entire inaccuracy of the statements which have been put into
                        circulation to the detriment of the interests of the Commonwealth, myself
                        and my staff.</p>
                    <p>Endless months were thus spent in writing and following up every clue from
                        Press comments or the official parliamentary Gazette and endless chasing of
                        this man and that. Well I remember the final race that I took with Mr.
                        Griffin (so that I might help out as errand boy if required) to place the
                        documents he had gathered together before the Prime Minister, Mr.
                            <note>Joseph</note> Cook. Way out in the far distance we went for the
                        surrounding municipalities of Sydney are all one-story buildings and so on
                        the level, so Sydney stretches on endlessly the most desolate of all forms
                        of desert, no vestige of beauty anywhere not even street plantings. And
                        frantically back to the city to catch the train</p>
                    <pb n="168"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 168 ====]</p>
                    <p>for Melbourne, to place these documents, after Mr. Cook's approval, in the
                        hands of his assistant Minister, Dr. Kelly, who was ready to demand of
                        Parliament that it place the whole correspondence and documents in
                        connection with the Federal Capital on the table, a proceeding which brings
                        it out of the secret places and makes it available. He caught the train. In
                        the course of the years he became renowned among the railroad people for
                        these last second arrivals for he was perpetually taking this trip between
                        Sydney and Melbourne. It was the one place where he could catch the
                        Ministers.</p>
                    <p>I remember one time when he had disappeared beyond the ken of either of his
                        offices, private or Federal, when we knew the importance of his catching the
                        train for Sydney. I had packed his suitcase; one draftsman was sent to the
                        station with it; one was placed at the foot of the elevator and another on
                        the street corner to forestall his losing a moment by getting off the tram
                        or coming up the lift. When he arrived at the last moment at the station,
                        grabbing his suitcase himself and catching the train because of our
                        precautions, the porter turned to the draftsman with disgust saying, "I
                        never would have waited if I had known it was that guy." Mr. Griffin always
                        preferred to carry his burdens himself.</p>
                    <p>The next day the papers were tabled. This made history. It led the Labor
                        Party to replace Mr. Archibald by Mr. O'Malley in the Home Affairs Ministry,
                        who with Mr. <note>William</note> Webster of the Post Office Department
                        later brought off the Royal Commission.</p>
                    <p>One of the fights during this period was on the case of building an arsenal.
                        It was a clever scheme to destroy the Capital City sooner or later by
                        locating the arsenal within the boundaries of Canberra. Washington had had
                        the experience of such a catastrophe early in its history. Griffin had
                        opposed this in every way he could think of, accumulating data and informing
                        members of Parliament and writing arguments for them against such procedure,
                        but finally the definite instruction had come from Archibald to lay out
                        plans for the location</p>
                    <pb n="169"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 169 ====]</p>
                    <p>and construction of buildings and industrial housing for this work. There
                        could be no answer to such a precise instruction except acquiescence or
                        resignation. That night looked dark indeed. I can't remember now whether we
                        went to a moving picture show or just kept on with the drive of office work
                        but we arrived home about midnight to find a note pinned on our pillow, for
                        one of the Cabinet Ministers was lodging in the same residence. The
                        documents laid on the table had worked. The standing of the whole Labor
                        Party then in power was jeopardized by the character of the facts revealed
                        in them, and they had called a meeting, and by election by the party members
                        had shuffled a couple of the Ministers, one of them Mr. Archibald, and
                        replaced him by Mr. O'Malley now again in the Home Affairs Ministry.</p>
                    <p>It was a new lease of life. Two of the Ministers were sympathetic with the
                        movement, really important to the Labor Party (important to the people of
                        Australia) of establishing a Federal Capital. It was they who had called for
                        an international competition.</p>
                    <p>But the fight continued. Griffin would never have lived through these years
                        of fight with the Civil Service if it hadn't been for the advice and
                        assistance of Mr. James Alexander Smith, an engineer of world renown.
                        Griffin soon learned to put none of his letters through until he had taken
                        them to Mr. Smith for advice. Griffin was a very able thinker and letter
                        writer but he put things from a rational point of view and reason is no
                        element of bureaucracy. Mr. Smith from his experience within officialdom and
                        from without, for he had refused to continue in the Service, would tell
                        Griffin to leave the letter overnight and the next morning would frequently
                        give him a totally different letter for he was able to see just how the
                        officials would answer the points brought up. He always put the letter in
                        such a form as to forestall the possibility of their putting forth such
                        answers. The combination of Griffin's town planning knowledge and Smith's
                        scientific knowledge and diplomacy prevented disaster.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 170 ====]</p>
                    <p>Now with the new Ministers, the fight of the officials had to start from a
                        new angle.</p>
                    <p>This sort of thing went on till in 1916 this remarkable thing happened. A
                        Royal Commission was demanded by two Ministers of the Crown, the Minister of
                        Home Affairs permitting the Minister of the Post Office to call for a Royal
                        Commission on the Home Affairs Department, and nine solid months of evidence
                        piled up such a case against the officials that Griffin was able to work
                        effectively in the development of Canberra for three years at the end of
                        which time the plan was Gazetted which meant there could be no deviation
                        from it without an act of Parliament.</p>
                    <p>Only one other Royal Commission in the British Empire has ever given a
                        verdict against the officialdom.</p>
                    <note>WBG won the Canberra design competition in 1912 under the Andrew Fisher
                        government (King O'Malley, Minister of Home Affairs). But he first came to
                        Australia and was appointed Director of Design and Construction under the
                        Joseph Cook government (June 1913 to September 1914; W.H. Kelly, acting
                        Minister of Home Affairs). This administration was replaced by a new Fisher
                        government (September 1914 to October 1915; W.O. Archibald, Minister of Home
                        Affairs). In October 1915 came the first of four successive William Morris
                        Hughes governments (O'Malley, Minister of Home Affairs, and William Webster,
                        Postmaster-General, in the first government). In the summer of 1916 a Royal
                        Commission, headed by Wilfred Blacket, was appointed to review the planning
                        for the Federal Capital. The Commissioner reported his findings in the
                        spring of 1917.</note>

                    <p>IN ROYAL COMMISSIONS</p>
                    <p>In Royal Commissions we find a most curious state of affairs. The Government
                        is helpless before the Judiciary and this in the affairs that are supposed
                        to be of most vital concern to the community. There is no court or judge
                        before whom they can take their cases so they have to go from pillar to post
                        asking this judge and that if they will be so kind as to take on this case.
                        Frequently every one of the supreme judges will refuse to take on a Royal
                        Commission. Then sometimes no State judge will act. Then the Government goes
                        hunting about for a barrister who will be willing to act. Naturally in a
                        case that looks bad for the officials it will be extremely difficult to find
                        anyone willing to take it on as, if a judgment against the officials is
                        rendered, it means the end of that judge's career and if the truth is plain
                        to the public it may be very trying to have to render a judgment in their
                        favor.</p>
                    <p>The system is one which presupposes that one will not be inclined to accept
                        the position unless it has been made worth his while by one side or the
                        other. As a rule all the favors are in the hands of the bureaucrats. Again
                        the system is one that promotes corruption.</p>

                    <p>Mr. James Alexander Smith, one of the greatest engineers Australia has
                        produced, whose visitors in years gone by have included nearly every
                        outstanding man of science and engineering who has come to Australia.</p>
                    <p>When he left the Railways he went into private practice as a consultant and
                        his fame gradually spread all over Australia and beyond. There is not an
                        engineer in Melbourne today who does not speak of him with immense respect.</p>
                    <p>As a consulting engineer he was responsible for works of considerable
                        magnitude in Victoria and beyond. Thirty years ago the Government appointed
                        him engineer member of a committee of engineer, architect and surveyor, who
                        selected W.B. Griffin's prize winning plan for the city of Canberra from a
                        number of plans received from all over the world.</p>
                    <p>Early in the century he was president for four years or the Victorian
                        Institute of Engineers. The last paper he read before the Institute revealed
                        his celebrated plan for roofing over the Flinders Street railway yards.
                        There are many in Melbourne who believe that his plan will one day be
                        carried out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blacket <note>Wilfred Blacket, Royal Commissioner</note> should be held

                    <p>Mr. J.A. Smith was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th Century but
                        realizing the mood of the times he refused to publicize his work convinced,
                        as has since been proved, that these discoveries would be used for
                        destruction instead of construction.</p>
                    <p>He suggested that Melbourne, which has but one Railway Center, should lower
                        whatever rails were not already below surface level and build above them
                        what would greatly increase the present business center serving at once to
                        lower costs and increase convenience.</p>

                    <p>UNIVERSAL EMPLOYMENT ATTAINED BY FREEING ENTERPRISE</p>
                    <p>The issue is not between Capital and Labor but between Corporations and
                        Industry.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental <hi rend="ul">requirements</hi> are:-</p>
                    <p>1st - How to facilitate FREE ENTERPRISE</p>
                    <p>2nd - How to arouse and implement ENTHUSIASM for production, always
                        increasing enthusiasm in individuals while preventing their taking unfair
                        advantage of others.</p>
                    <p>The METHOD is to search out the obstacles in the way of attaining the above.</p>
                    <p>1st - What form of GOVERNMENT facilitates these ends.</p>
                    <p>2nd - What steps other than political should the community take.</p>
                    <p>The two elements upon which increased employment and production of wealth
                        depend are HUMAN ABILITIES and</p>
                    <p>ACCESS TO NATURE</p>
                    <p>These two offer endless opportunities for employment if access to them is not
                        shut off by some MONOPOLISTIC POWER.</p>
                    <p>Our problem is to show how to get maximum from these 2 without menace to the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>What <hi rend="ul">form</hi> of SOCIAL ORGANIZATION most facilitates the
                        maximum employment without menace to future humanity, menace such as
                        devastation of the wilds of the United States during the past.</p>
                    <p>What measures must we take to attain our ends.</p>
                    <p>The Economic system is really running ahead in this realm for it has
                        established the system of DIVISION OF LABOR which gives maximum and cheapest
                        production. This is about the only up to date element in our communities.
                        Here, with no intrusion of morals, Altruism has established itself for in
                        this system each one produces for someone else. Humanity becomes an
                        inter-dependent Unity. Morals, as we shall see, belong in the Political
                        Realm, in the</p>

                    <p>maintenance of Equity, and as yet only in America has the Political Organ
                        written that into its constitution.</p>
                    <p>EMPLOYMENT IS A WORLD ISSUE. The question of its attainment must go beyond
                        the borders of the nations or we shall be faced with wars which will
                        continue with increasing ferocity so long as mechanical genius continues to
                        develop unless -</p>
                    <p>Therefore our first question, the urgent issue of the present moment is:-</p>
                    <p>1st- What changes in community organization should be made in this the best
                        form, the Congressional, found only in the United States?</p>
                    <p>This is urgent since there seems to be a subterranean influence working for
                        the perpetuation of the worst of all forms of government since all kinds of
                        tyranny can screen themselves behind it - the Parliamentary form, the froth
                        of which comes up even in our American Universities. It took a war of
                        Revolution for the United States to free itself from that form. It is dust
                        in the eye to say that it was a King from which we were escaping. The
                        writers of Our Constitution knew the evils of the Parliamentary System of
                        their own experience. This is the most urgent question in the reconstruction
                        of the world at the close of this war.</p>
                    <p>It is urgent also since now the Oriental peoples (whose numbers reach the
                        billion mark) are quite equal to the Occidentals (who number but a few
                        million) in intellectual, scientific and mechanical ability. The present war
                        has thoroughly awakened them to the issue of EMPLOYMENT.</p>
                    <p>A quarter of a century of life under each form, the Congressional and the
                        Parliamentary, has made clear the radical difference between the two which
                        is understood by almost no one, yet is the chief issue today as it was in
                        our first war. It is the basic issue of employment</p>

                    <p>as it is the issue between concentrated Power and Democracy.</p>
                    <p>1st- Only under the Congressional form do the people have the opportunity, if
                        they choose to use it, of selecting their Executive. The electoral system
                            <note>US Electoral College?</note>, a hang-over from the past, should be
                        ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in the reach of the
                        masses of the people.</p>
                    <p>2nd- Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes can
                        determine the Executive from the start or at any time after the election by
                        throwing out the elected party whenever they want to which gives then a
                        powerful influence over them even without overthrowing them. They vote as
                        they are told to vote or out they go. And the whole complicated and
                        expensive business of election has to be gone through again. No wonder the
                        people are dejected. I know one man who was under 7 different ministers
                        during the 7 years of his employment by the Government, partly through
                        changes forced on the Cabinet, several through the throwing out of the whole
                        majority party.</p>
                    <p>This means that after the war Americans should use every possible means to
                        direct the reorganization of Europe toward the Congressional form, and the
                        basic principle should be laid down as the maintenance of Equity. Nowhere
                        but in America is this the intention of government.</p>
                    <p>The next step should be to eliminate the power of granting monopolies from
                        the Political realm. Whatever is done in this realm should be by the
                        Abilities Organ. The Political - the central organ - would have the task and
                        the power of preventing inequity.</p>
                    <p>The power to throw out Congressmen who fail to do what they are elected to do
                        could be attained in the Congressional form by an amendment giving the right
                        of recall. This would not be advisable in the case of the President as his
                        function is executive which requires</p>
                    <pb n="179"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 179 ====]</p>
                    <p>continuity. A fixed term and the reward of re-election if he has served well
                        will meet the requirements in this case. He is not a law maker though he has
                        advisory functions.</p>
                    <p>With the form of the Political government correct and its function simply to
                        maintain EQUITY we turn to the</p>
                    <p>ABILITIES ORGAN:- With local groups - somewhat of the nature of parent and
                        teacher organizations - and inter-organized to meet various wider needs than
                        only the control of education, purposes could be effected which would center
                        neither on making warriors nor serfs out of the mass of the people.
                        Capacities could be highly developed and efficiency enormously increased and
                        the whole field of education broadened and extended to meet the requirements
                        of men <hi rend="ul">throughout their lives</hi>. The collection of the
                        unearned increment in land values in the hands of these groups (the
                        Political safeguarding Equity) would provide education throughout the
                        lifetime of the citizenry so that any changes in employment due to new
                        inventions or other factors could be provided for by opening opportunities
                        for education in all fields throughout man's life instead of his being
                        thrown out of work or reduced to lower standards of living.</p>
                    <p>Having recognized that in the Political Realm the idea of Equity is the
                        opposite of Welfare which but leads to war since it rests on the idea that
                        might is right and that conquering a country is a benefit to the citizens of
                        the conquering country, we look at the realm of:-</p>
                    <p>ECONOMICS:- and having recognized the Community's obligation to free the
                        obstacles from the way of every man's developing his own abilities in his
                        own way we turn our attention to the ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION of the Community
                        which has to function in a totally different realm to meet the bodily needs
                        of men. In this everyone in the community must be included as he is
                        concerned either as</p>
                    <pb n="180"/>

                    <p>producer or consumer, as manager or worker, agriculturist or technician.</p>
                    <p>The period following the founding of America has developed an ECONOMIC life
                        which is essentially a community affair since it is based on division of
                        labor. It is now plain that economic problems cannot be solved as individual
                        concerns. To meet the <hi rend="ul">bodily needs</hi> is now a community
                        affair and requires a Community organization. This can function wholesomely
                        only if it is independent of the Political organ. Its laws are entirely
                        different. Business cannot be run democratically. There can be no efficiency
                        in business run by majority votes. Its law is MUTUALITY not Equity. An
                        ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION should consist of the total citizenry, not organized
                        democratically but consisting of representatives of all types of economic
                        associations and with the exact knowledge which comes from experience in
                        economic affairs.</p>
                    <p>With the liaison of the Political and Economic organizations broken down, the
                        Political organ can function freely in the maintenance of Equity as it does
                        in the problem of the traffic on our streets.</p>
                    <p>The concept of a united <hi rend="ul">States</hi> of Europe or of the World
                        is purely fantastic at present since different groups of people do not have
                        the same moral standards. But that they could function together in an
                        Economic Organ for mutual advantage is a sound principle in business
                        dealings. It can start in a Nation. Where is the easiest place in the world
                        to put that concept into practice? America should take the initiative.</p>
                    <p>Though we must have different Political units, when it comes to the Economic
                        Organ we can, without confusion, have units either corresponding to National
                        boundaries or consisting of several units, say the Americas and China, or a
                        WORLD ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION</p>
                    <pb n="181"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 181 ====]</p>
                    <p>which would be the soundest of all for then we should have that type of
                        organization where things are made and sold within one and the same boundary
                        of which the U.S. as an example (in contradiction
                        <note>contradistinction?</note> to Britain) one where the manufacturer sells
                        to his employees, which of itself tends to the maximum wages, lowest cost
                        and highest standard of living in the community as a whole.</p>
                    <p>To effect the separation of these two - the political and the economic -
                        would not be difficult here, at least comparatively speaking. Organization
                        is the peculiar genius of the American people.</p>
                    <p>There should of course be no trying to bring this about by political means.
                        We cannot expect a King to cut off his own head.</p>
                    <p>Economics is the realm of buying and selling - I sell to you because it is to
                        my advantage to get rid of a thing. You buy because it is to your advantage
                        to have it. The advantage is MUTUAL. So MONEY, the implement of EXCHANGE,
                        should be in the control of the ECONOMIC ORGAN where it would be made to
                        measure real values so that inflation would be as impossible as in the
                        barter system.</p>
                    <p>These three functions cannot be fulfilled by one organ without disease, the
                        evidence of which we certainly see in our present communities, It is as
                        impossible as it would be for the individual human being to carry out his
                        three functions of digesting, circulation and thinking without the three
                        organizations of the stomach, the heart and the brain.</p>

                    <p>CHAPTER I - 3 YEAR BATTLE BEFORE A 3 YEAR SWING</p>
                    <p>My husband was born in the great Chemical Ether Realm of the Mississippi
                        River valley. He was one of the group of creative thinkers which 20th
                        century science would lead us to expect to arise from a region ruled by that
                        Ether from which all new forms arise - the chemical ether. Warmth &amp;
                        Light are centrifugal forces. Sound &amp; Magnetism are condensing
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>I myself was well described by a friend of Mother's into whose charge I had
                        been placed when a child for a bit of art instruction. A friend asked her if
                        I were an artist. She said, "No but if she makes up her mind to be one she
                        will be one." When I was born Venus followed the Sun. My destiny evidently
                        was to prepare myself in all those fields of art which would make me a good
                        slave to my husband in his creative work. Since the creative forces in a
                        woman naturally turn to sacrifice it was my great joy to the end to fulfill
                        this function as best I could. The general verdict seemed to be that I did
                        it well. When, after Griffin's death in India, I returned to Australia and
                        called on Mr. James Alexander Smith he said, "No one can replace Mr.
                        Griffin," then after a pause, "unless it is you," and I replied, "No I could
                        not replace him but I was a very useful slave to him in his work."</p>
                    <p>Griffin's appointment as Federal Director was for 3 years. Those years were a
                        perpetual battle, one might say against an Empire. During those years it was
                        continual warfare always with the subtle assistance of Mr. Smith, battling
                        with the Works Committee and finally with the Royal Commission, the second
                        one of the only two ever to condemn the officialdom.</p>
                    <p>During these years and the succeeding years Griffin carried on a successful
                        private business with a group of loyal, capable and devoted young people.
                        Life was never dull.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 187 ====]</p>
                    <p>Dear Mother - Mr. Anderson is the engineer Walt is using at Canberra who was
                        a tremendous help to Walt and to Mr. <note>William</note> Webster (Member of
                        the Cabinet) who carried through the Royal Commission on Canberra - only one
                        other in history where the verdict was given against the officials. Mr.
                        Anderson though a surveyor for many years in England is debarred from
                        practicing his profession in this country till he has served a full time of
                        apprenticeship for 3 years in some surveyor's office here in Australia! In
                        such petty ways, lacking in reality, do they try to make themselves believe
                        they are an independent people.</p>
                    <p>After their visit with us we sent some snap shots of the infants to Mrs.
                        Anderson and the following is a copy of the answer she sent us which I
                        thought might amuse you. For fear you might not catch it I'll inform you
                        that she is referring to me and the impromptu dinner I gave them.</p>
                    <p>Oh! Alstan and Miriam:- Cherubic and Seraphic imps. Ye alone were powerful
                        enough to rouse me from a drowsy wousy afternoon bye-bye just 15 minutes
                        ago, and make the kindred spirit that lies like a forgotten germ in an old
                        carcass, spring to life and smile. Alstan (Lippincott), you are a perfect
                        Lippincott and if you do not set the Thames, I mean the Mississippi, on fire
                        some day I shall be disappointed. Miriam (Elgh), set your face toward the
                        stars and you will draw all men to you, and you have it in you to be
                        ambitious to gain either souls or hearts. Which will it be I wonder. Anyway
                        I am the happier this day for knowing there are Lippincotts and Elghs in the
                        world so you have begun to make good.</p>
                    <p>But above you, surrounding you, floating ever and again before my vision is
                        an enchanting wraith of which I must try to tell you. It is a Spirit and
                        Body. It cannot be seen and ever forgotten. Did you ever look into a lake
                        that had formed in a crater, trying vainly to see the bottom, or gazed
                        piercingly up into the "Coal Sack" for a beyond? I see not what the soul in
                        me yearns for there, but I have almost caught it in those Eyes. Life is too
                        full of living to look</p>

                    <p>often into the Heights and Depths; so I veil those things which I have seen
                        there, and talk of pots and pans and cabbages and kings.</p>
                    <p>As I saw her - flitting, darting, flashing from barrow (Australian for fruit
                        stand) to barrow in Collins Street - the only seeable thing in Collins
                        Street, garbed in restful blue, a saffron scarf waving and curving round her
                        head in the evening sunset breeze;- in the seething 6 o'clock cauldron of
                        Collins Street her form alone alluring, obliterating the ruck and muck drew
                        our gaze. She invited us to feast with her, and the magic of her tongue
                        together with the verve and abandon with which she entered into the game,
                        made us dizzy and oblivious of our numbers and the trouble we would give and
                        she would take to make us enjoy the game.</p>
                    <p>Oh that all dinners were as enjoyable in the making and the taking as that
                        one. (This was when we were living in the Doll house "Pholiota" in the same
                        yard with the Lippincotts M.M.G.) Almost thou persuadest me to be a
                        socialist. We should not eat that which we do not work for or prepare, or at
                        least look on at the preparation, and into the fires slumberous in Those
                        Eyes of which there were fitful glimpses.</p>
                    <p>The powers of that Witch Goddess! We each smile with pleasant memories in our
                        eyes when we think of the evening with our Director and Directress. And even
                        the real Socialist present (referring to the chauffeur) had, by the time our
                        hostess had graciously bowed him out, learned somewhat of culture from the
                        atmosphere of an Aristocrat-Socialist. This was apparent to the woman who
                        sees but cannot do. (You see it is hard to get away from the class idea.
                        Democracy is a word of which Australians - Europeans - do not know the
                        meaning. M.M.G.) Alstan and Miriam, dear infants, you have something to
                        climb to. Laugh and grow fat and enjoy your little day. Happiness within and
                        without to you all - Griffins and Lippincotts and Elghs. Faithfully yours

                    <p>Collins Street, Melbourne - 10 January, 1917 - Beloved Clarmyra
                            <note>daughter of MMG's sister, Georgine</note>, Well I went over to
                        Uncle Walter's Federal office after writing Mama Gene's letter and found him
                        busy dictating. I suggested that it was fifteen minutes till train time. No!
                        he said and pulled out his watch which had stopped. He still thought it was
                        about two. You can see where we would have been if I had waited for him to
                        come for me. We got our train and were met at the station by the Russels who
                        took us up in their car to their house on the mount, a lovely place on the
                        side of a gully, their yard going down a hundred feet to a running stream,
                        and a fine view across to Melbourne whose lights we could see at night.</p>
                    <p>A three hour walk next morning, two little girls along, nine years old, and a
                        long one the next morning climbing to the top of the mount, this time only
                        grown ups, not nearly so much fun; and the third day all day in the auto,
                        the little girls and three other guests. A very jolly day going through some
                        of the old mining districts. I felt that I had got quite a glimpse of
                        Australia.</p>
                    <p>I had great fun picking blackberries on the place and kept the family
                        supplied, also raspberries and currants and great big delicious
                        gooseberries, and lettuce and peas and onions from the garden. We had a very
                        homey time and it was a great rest.</p>
                    <p>I have just been over to the station to meet Walter who was to come home from
                        Canberra this noon but he didn't come gosh darn him. If he comes tomorrow
                        he'll probably have to go back the very next day yet there are things he'll
                        probably have to come back for. He is going up with the Minister of Home
                        Affairs. That's the fourth change in Ministry he has had and we are
                        wondering when the next change will happen. He sort of has to begin over at
                        the beginning with each new Minister. However to each three steps backward
                        we are still hoping there is one forward to the good. Only time will tell.
                        Who cares. It's exceedingly funny at times, "But for God's sake don't
                        smile," one friend tells us; "These people are British."</p>

                        to tell you you couldn't cry, that crying wasn't allowed in flats, and you
                        were quite obedient. But really that isn't half so bad as not being allowed
                        to laugh. But even that isn't so bad as the fate of a little girl I passed
                        on the street some time ago. She was sitting beside a beggar and I heard him
                        tell her "Now cry," and she had to start crying so that people would give
                        him money. A pretty hard way for that tiny girl to earn money for the grown
                        ups wasn't it. Much love from Auntie.</p>
                    <p>1917 - January, 12. Dear Mother, I am taking things very easy at the office
                        now, and not hurrying with the breakfast dishes to come down town with
                        Walter, though his toilet takes so much longer than mine that it is not a
                        serious task for me to get up and get breakfast and wash the dishes while he
                        is getting ready to leave the house. And I am either taking a nap in the
                        middle of the afternoon or leaving early and going home instead of waiting
                        here at the office to dine at uncertain hours with Walter. He has to spend
                        practically all his evenings as well as all day on his Federal work,
                        frequently in consultations, instead of at his private office, so that my
                        staying down gives me only a half hour with him as a rule to go over the
                        private office work.</p>
                    <p>I am no longer trying to get an occasional lunch with him but am joining the
                        family party in the office. We all of us get so sick of lunching out,
                        especially in fly time, as no pains are taken at any of the restaurants to
                        keep them out which makes the physical exercise of driving away the flies
                        from your food too strenuous for restfulness to say nothing of the damaging
                        effect it had on one's appetite. This sounds almost like a family quarrel
                        with my husband, but it's just an interlude of rational living for one half
                        the family, in spite of the fact that the other half of the family cannot
                        indulge. (The completion of the Cafe Australia for Mr. Lucas started a
                        revolution in community services of this kind as did the plumbing of Newman
                        College</p>

                    <p>of the sanitary methods and the Capitol Theatre in the theatrical world.)</p>
                    <p>1917 - February, 1 - Dear Mother, We think Mr. Wilson's <note>President
                            Woodrow Wilson's</note> speech to the Senate is magnificent. Our hope is
                        that his motive is to be able to say to the European nations, "You see that
                        we are ready to give up just as much as you would have to do in disarming,"
                        as he could also say in internationalizing the Panama Canal along with the
                        other canals of the world. Walter has been away all this week, the Royal
                        Commission is still sitting on Canberra. We hope it is nearly over now.
                        Though the Taylors <note>Florence M. and George A. Taylor</note> are
                        frantically libeling the Cafe Australia, thinking no doubt that if they make
                        it disagreeable enough for each of our clients people will be afraid to
                        employ us and since the whole population of this country is about that of a
                        good sized city in the U.S. and everybody knows about everybody it is of
                        course a fruitful field for gossip, but not being particularly cowardly
                        ourselves we are not disturbing ourselves in the least about these things.
                        They may know their public and then again they may not. Walter is just as
                        peaceful and well and cheerful and energetic as ever and some very important
                        things have been accomplished. We call him "Protected of Heaven" as he
                        certainly seems to be in his bucking up against an Empire. I wish Mrs.
                            <note>Mary?</note> Wilmarth would come over with you to visit us. I
                        think we could make her comfortable simple as our quarters are. Oceans of
                        love from your daughter.</p>
                    <p><bibl>1917 - February, 12 - Melbourne, Herald - clipping</bibl> - Mr.
                            <note>William</note> Webster, the Post Master General, explained the
                        connection of Mr. W.B. Griffin with the designing of the new automatic
                        telephone exchange in Sydney, and of his charge against the Commonwealth of
                        £192 of plans, etc. Mr. Webster stated that after inspection of the original
                        design (of the Department officials)<note>handwritten parenthetical note by
                            MMG</note> he found it to be extravagant and lacking in co-ordination.
                        He asked Mr. Griffin to look into the matter. He did so, and drew up a plan
                        saving a floor and a half, representing £7500. He was also assured by Mr.
                        Griffin that the General Post Office could be remodeled giving much
                        additional space at a comparatively small cost. Mr. Griffin's</p>
                    <note>In the first paragraph MMG is probably referring to President Wilson's
                        speech severing diplomatic relations with Germany over that country's
                        decision to begin unrestricted submarine warfare.</note>

                    <p>advice had been most valuable, and he was rightly entitled to one and a
                        quarter percent commission on the original building. The charge was moderate
                        and the money was well spent. (I should have included the revolutionizing of
                        Post Offices as he did with the Post Offices of Sydney and Melbourne, and of
                        office buildings in general with the Capitol Theatre building which was the
                        first tall building over there though it did go only to the height of ten
                        stories.)</p>
                    <p>22 February 1917 - Dearest Clarmyra, Washington's birthday and tomorrow is
                        Mama Gene's <note>Georgine Mahony Smith's</note>. I wish I could help
                        decorate her table with a great bunch of Amaryllis lilies such as we are
                        getting here now. I had a surprise party on my birthday. Genevieve
                            <note>Lippincott</note>, when she was leaving Sunday evening said, "You
                        and Walter come over to dinner with us Wednesday." I thought she was crazy
                        to expect Walter but said I would get him to come if I could. Afterward it
                        dawned on me that it would be the 14th, my birthday.</p>
                    <p>Well Walter managed it though he had to skip away right after dinner. It's a
                        pleasant boarding house where they are and they arranged for a private room
                        for the party so it was very jolly. Genevieve had been down to our flat the
                        day before and had made a cake and had so removed all her traces that I
                        didn't know she had been there and they had also made ice cream and candy.
                        Tell Mrs. Raftis I did get her Christmas letter and nonsense book about us
                        and we did have a good laugh and it did feel good. First I laughed by myself
                        and afterward I laughed to see Walter laugh as he read it. I shall get
                        around to writing to her as soon as I can.</p>
                    <p>The Royal Commission ended yesterday. So thankful to have it over with - nine
                        months on the witness stand. The Commissioner's report will not be in for a
                        while yet so we can tell nothing about results till then. The few moments of
                        relief in the tension we are going to make use of in returning some of our
                        social obligations. We have made some wonderful friendships, Mr. and Mrs.

                        calling tonight and tomorrow, and the next night we are going to invite some
                        people to the house. The great difficulty with that is that it is impossible
                        to invite any two families at the same time. They are all either enemies or
                        of different classes or something or other. Such a country. However our flat
                        wouldn't hold many so that relieves the queer look of it a little.</p>
                    <p>We had no bowl and pitcher in our house so last week I decided I wouldn't put
                        off any longer getting something a guest could wash in. Plumbing is unknown
                        in Australia even in Sydney and Melbourne. We had made up our minds we
                        simply would not have an ordinary bedroom set. They are so ugly. So I looked
                        about and found something I thought would do - a large flat flower bowl and
                        two water bottles to match. So I went up to the Federal Office and made
                        Walter go over to see if it suited him. But he went me one better and we got
                        a lovely bronze bowl and a big bronze flower vase for a slop jar and two
                        blue china water bottles. It makes a very handsome set and really cost but
                        very little more than the ordinary ugly things for which they charge three
                        to five pounds for the very cheapest. Now we are going to get a couch cover
                        for the bed in that room which will make it look quite pretty. Lovingly,
                        Aunt.</p>
                    <p>23 February, 1917. - Dearest Gene <note>Georgine, MMG's sister</note>, Many
                        happy returns of the day. As I have been thinking back we must be just about
                        the age of Mother when she was plugging for the principal's exam with Mrs.
                        Young at which time a new career began for her and for Chicago schools under
                        her influence with her whole school an art gallery and the music
                        unbelievable to the Superintendents and her continued courses with her
                        teachers, initiating what afterward became University Extension courses. She
                        certainly has done a splendid life's work since then so after I get a good
                        rest I am going to start to emulate her. There has been another change of
                        ministry, the fifth Walt has been under. Talk about the</p>

                    <p>unstable governments of South America! I am however obliged to confess that
                        Walt has been the chief cause of the overthrows. There is to be an election
                        in October so there may be still another change then. We are thankful that
                        Mr. <note>William</note> Webster is still in the Cabinet. He is a splendid
                        man, a tremendous worker and one of our main stays.</p>
                    <p>Last night instead of starting on our social rounds we had a quiet evening, a
                        leisurely dinner and just sat around and read - most satisfying. We are
                        vegetarians when we dine chez nous. I can hardly say with propriety that I
                        am delighted at the prospect of inheriting Alice's three little girls since
                        that would entail the death of Alice and Clara, but I certainly would be
                        delighted to have the girls. Love to my dear sister.</p>
                    <p>1917 - February, 26 - Mother Darling, Saturday Walter and I did have a
                        sensation. He had promised the afternoon to me to go over the planting plans
                        for the Newman College or perhaps even to take a walk through the Botanic
                        Gardens, so I went for him at lunch time, waited around while he finished
                        one thing and another. Then after lunch he said he must still see his
                        Minister who was leaving for Adelaide that afternoon at four. We tried to
                        get to his hotel but were blocked by a Win the War parade. Then we aimed for
                        the station but did not know the route of the Parade and every turn we took
                        we found ourselves blocked. Finally at twenty to four I said let's try
                        breaking through which we succeeded in doing though a woman said "shame" to
                        me at my irreverence. Well we made the train though breathless. Then as
                        trams were crowded we walked home through the Botanic Gardens, always a
                        treat, got and ate supper and scooted back to town for a movie and it was a
                        sensation. How the Censor ever allowed it I don't see as it was a most
                        powerful pacifist sermon though of course there's no telling whether the
                        audience took it that way. It was "Intolerance," a magnificent spectacle
                        which you certainly must see when it comes your way. It shows four episodes
                        - Babylon - Jerusalem at the time of Christ - Massacre of St. Bartholomew -
                        and Modern. Certainly no one could ever call ours</p>
                    <pb n="196"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 196 ====]</p>
                    <p>a civilization after that comparison, with nothing but grime and ugliness to
                        show. Cyrus with his "Kill, kill, kill," and Catherine de Medici with her
                        "We must destroy them or we will be destroyed," as shown in the play slapped
                        you in the face after the spectacle in the afternoon with the enthusiasm of
                        the crowds on the streets and lined up on Parliament House steps - the
                        little wizened Minister of Defense and the big fat Minister of the Navy
                        sitting there and clapping their hands over the sending off of all the young
                        men of the community to "Kill, kill, kill." The picture went even so far as
                        to show a bit of modern warfare. It doesn't seem possible that the point
                        wasn't plain. But when one once gets the beam in his eye that it is virtuous
                        to kill rather than be killed there doesn't seem to be any vision left to
                        see anything. It is amazing to see how quickly the cloak of assumption of
                        Christianity drops off and the real religion of the people shows itself
                        which is hate your enemy and destroy anything or anybody if it is to your
                        advantage to do so, and certainly destroy anything you are afraid of and be
                        afraid of most everything.</p>
                    <p>Walter has been at home to dinner every night for a week and I am going to
                        skip along now and get a meal for him. I do think you should resign and see
                        no reason why life shouldn't be just as full of interest and enjoyment out
                        of school as in it. I certainly could keep you busy if you were over here,
                        and know the thousand things you will be interested in if you stay where you
                        are. The letters sound as if you had got along without serious colds at
                        least through the early winter. Hope the winter will pass without catching
                        you. Your devoted daughter, Marion.</p>
                    <p>12 March, 1917 - Dear Mrs. Griffin, You've no idea, I'm sure, how desperately
                        I'm in need of your slender, but capable and sustaining shoulder, to keep on
                        during these days of uncertainty. I think war, war, war morning noon and
                        night and consequently I row all day long with the Australians on the
                        subject, and have developed into such a termagant that I will be an outcast

                    <p>it. None of my erstwhile friends will have anything to do with me. I have had
                        bitter and hostile words with Miss Elsie Simpson who has come out here from
                        New York to be the Secretary of Professor Irvine of the Sydney University.
                        She thinks (and so does Prof. Irvine) that in the sleekness of our
                        prosperity we have lost our souls, in fact that the day will come "When the
                        people will cry for Wilson's blood because he has not helped <hi rend="ul"
                            >England</hi> spread the <hi rend="ul">doctrine of humanity</hi>." She
                        is sure that it is a sign of our degeneracy when a man like
                        <note>Theodore</note> Roosevelt the mighty is not called upon to take the
                        reins of government over this desperate period. She thinks England is
                        fighting for Belgium and defends the shooting of the Irish rebels - an act
                        that even the English government repudiated. She says frankly that the
                        mothers of the "lower" classes on the whole do not mind giving up their sons
                        and that they have children after the fashion of a cat having kittens.
                        Unfortunately she seems to believe that I will wield some influence when I
                        get home and has undertaken to convert me, pressing Prof. Irvine and Mr.
                        Adams, editor of the Red Page of the Bulletin, into her service to help with
                        my conversion. She pursues me with invitations which always end in insult,
                        and finally the 100% Irish in me sloughed off its pretense to civilization
                        and I let go. If she only wouldn't call herself an American. When she says
                        she's an aristocrat I always think of your definition of "something that
                        comes to the top." Aren't I awful?</p>
                    <p>I am going home Mrs. Griffin on the next boat which is the Sierra sailing
                        March 21st, and I'm going to do my bit to the best of my ability in the
                        interests of peace, disarmament and freedom of our Beloved (I guess I should
                        say my Beloved, shouldn't I) from entangling alliances. That sounds like a
                        mighty big order but you know every little bit helps, and unless I have a
                        moral awakening between now and then I'm going to be helpin' any way that
                        comes to hand and if, by using some of these nasty newspaper cuttings that I

                    <p>during my stay here, in communities where the people are obsessed with
                        Anglo-mania, I can further the cause I'm afraid I'm not above doing so. I
                        wish you would tell me how to specialize along this line. I've good
                        instincts which suit me fine but won't hold water in an argument, you know.
                        I'm studying the two books you recommended and am reading, reading, and
                        trying to think - the latter with discouraging results. I am sending along
                        under separate cover the Canberra story and I will be grateful if you will
                        look it over for me.</p>
                    <p>At Manly I had a lovely room right over the surf. How the Creator must have
                        loved humanity when he conceived the harbor of Sydney, I have just been to
                        see "Intolerance" which you must see when it comes to Melbourne. I do not
                        know, however, why I should recommend it to you because you are all
                        tolerance and it will break your heart. Most sincerely yours, Margaret
                        Murphy</p>
                    <p>1917 - March 14, Dear Miss Murphy, Don't get discouraged. I met Miss Simpson
                        myself. I couldn't talk to her because she was so hopelessly superficial but
                        Prof. Irvine I have a respect for as he did stand up for the right - my side
                        of course - in an issue I was fighting in Sydney with the Town Planning
                        Association though our points of view were far apart in many things but it
                        was at his house that several University professors in the very early days
                        of the war insisted that physical prowess was the proof of the superiority
                        of a people (in the course of condemning the U.S. for not coming in of
                        course) and when I asked if they meant that if Germany won in the war that
                        would prove the superiority of the German people they said "yes." </p>
                    <p>I must impress upon you that it is not undemocratic to object to seeing a
                        lovely prospect defiled by a lot of chairs which stupid humans clutter a
                        place up with. Democracy, the "highest ideal the human mind has ever climbed
                        to" requires nothing ugly nor destructive nor mean. As to information about
                        Australian flora, it is almost impossible to get it. I will send you a
                        little book on Acacias which will confirm this statement of mine. There are
                        botanical books of course but it is not possible to get much for landscape
                        work from</p>
                    <pb n="200"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 200 ====]</p>
                    <p>them. Just as Mr. Griffin was one of the pioneers in the use of native plants
                        in the U.S. which has since become so popular, so here he has had to gather
                        most all of the data necessary for native planting himself. Ever since his
                        arrival we have used every possible opportunity for learning the points of
                        the wonderfully beautiful native flora, decorative, soil requirements,
                        seasons of blooming, etc. I wish I had shown you the volume we have
                        compiled, 8 inches by 16 inches by 4 inches thick. It has been some task but
                        lots of fun. We have got mostly from direct observation assisted, when we
                        first came over, by Miss Leplastrier in weekend walks, and other botanists
                        from whose knowledge of plants Mr. Griffin's landscape questions piled up
                        information that they would not include in their written works. Also from
                        constant watching of the very fine Botanical gardens of Sydney and Melbourne
                        through all seasons aided by such botanical reference books as those of
                        Guilfoile and Miss Sulman who have written popular botanies, Cambage and
                        others. I don't know whether I gave you a copy of a talk I gave in Sydney on
                        Citizenship. One page of that takes up a hurried summary of the points of
                        some of the lovely avenue trees and I'll write a bit on the decorative
                        plantings for Canberra.</p>
                    <p>The little I have seen of you has been a great pleasure but I am not sorry
                        you are hurrying home. A little inside glimpse of the system which is
                        universal among white folks outside of the States may help to keep them from
                        falling into some of the pitfalls. I do love my folks even if I have no
                        patriotism and I do hope they will assist in preventing the destruction of
                        democratic movement in the world. Please tell President Wilson when you see
                        him not to renege on his principles that we have been so proud of, that
                        slurs and insults have meant nothing to us any more than they would coming
                        from any mad man. Affectionately, Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>1917 - May, 18 - Dear Clarmyra <note>MMG's niece</note>, Your letter came
                        yesterday while I was in the midst of making a chocolate cake to celebrate
                        Genevieve's <note>Genevieve Lippincott's</note> birthday. As it came to the
                        office I had Miss Ullyatt bring it out to</p>
                    <pb n="201"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 201 ====]</p>
                    <p>me and fed her on cake and frosting too thin to have set yet while I sat down
                        to read my letters from you and Gene <note>Georgine Mahony Smith</note>. I
                        hope she enjoyed the cake as much as I enjoyed your letters.</p>
                    <p>I realize now that I can no longer call you dear babe, since you are now
                        entering High School. Remember to take manual training even if you are the
                        only girl in the class. I am glad you have had a chance to hear both your
                        Uncle Jerome's point of view and mine. There are always two points of view -
                        one right. It is of vital importance that one should familiarize oneself
                        with both and take upon himself the responsibility of deciding which is
                        right. I am sending you a pamphlet Roy's <note>Roy Lippincott's</note>
                        mother sent him speaking of their "adventurous belief in the Christian
                        principle of human brotherhood." Undertaking to live according to that
                        principle is a great and thrilling adventure in which the Quakers have often
                        proved, in the most surprising circumstances, its absolute efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday a birthday party. Roy <note>Lippincott</note> come home at about
                        half past four and made the strawberry ice cream. One can't buy decent ice
                        cream in Australia. Walter as usual came in the last minute after the guests
                        had arrived and when all the work was done. He has enough good excuses for
                        us to let him off the domestic work. When I have guests now I have my Mrs.
                        McEwan come in to wash up the dishes. As there is only one entrance which
                        opens right into the living room, we put a stool outside out bedroom window
                        and she crawls in so that she reaches the kitchen without anyone knowing she
                        is there. She is as pleasant and cute about this as in other ways wanting to
                        make everything run as smoothly as possible. She is a pretty woman and her
                        name is Kathleen, anyway she is all right. We call her our domestic engineer
                        and in applying for jobs as a charwoman she tells folks that that is what
                        her present employers call her. Good wishes on your graduation and birthday
                        month. Aunt.</p>
                    <p>1917 - October, 29 - Melbourne - Dear Gene <note>Georgine Mahony
                        Smith</note>, Adelaide is a pretty city and I was glad to get a glimpse of
                        it. If they had had sense enough</p>
                    <pb n="202"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 202 ====]</p>
                    <p>to do the same stunt with Melbourne it would have been beautiful - set it
                        back at the foot of the hills leaving the port itself to the flat strip of
                        coast. You have to take a train from Adelaide to Port Adelaide. Its like Los
                        Angeles and its sea port town. I had implored Walter not to attend this
                        conference. We know the men who were running it and I hate to have him soil
                        his skirts by having anything to do with them or lend their assemblies the
                        dignity of his name. However he isn't so particular about the skirts of his
                        coat and refuses to foresee evil intent. If anyone ever lived up to the
                        principle of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil it is he.</p>
                    <p>It was a disgraceful business all right and carried with a high hand. They
                        are trying to pass a law which will grant a huge monopoly, destroying all
                        private or local enterprise in architecture or town-planning. Walter did
                        what he could to stem the tide and get some semblance of democratic
                        principle instilled into the resolutions or into the consciousness of the
                        assembly but nobody in this community believes in those lines. People love
                        to put their necks under a yoke. No argument was allowed. It was absurd to
                        call it a conference. It was a Sunday school picnic with nice little
                        kindergarten talks all arranged for the supposed experts to listen to. The
                        only democratic suggestion that was made was by the Governor General whose
                        speech closed the conference - the only one with a grain of sense in it.</p>
                    <p>1917 - October, 29 - Dear Robins - Delighted to get the Round Robin (a letter
                        which circled the world between 8 of us Boston M.I.T. <note>Massachusetts
                            Institute of Technology</note> girls from 1894 and still does in 1945).
                        For the first time I am not sending it back on the same boat leaving within
                        a week. This time it has to wait for the next boat probably delaying it
                        three weeks. In the first place the Censor delayed it and then I went to
                        Adelaide for a week where it was sent to me. This is the third of
                        Australia's cities I have had a chance to visit. Walter had to go down as a
                        delegate to a Town Planning conference so I tagged along for a lark. If the
                        conference hadn't been</p>

                    <p>such a scandalous piece of business we should have had a very pleasant time.
                        City lovely, entertainment most hospitable but it leaves a horrible taste in
                        one's mouth to see things being put over the poor innocents. It's a city of
                        flowers all right and a perfect climate - nestled at the foot of lovely
                        hills from whose slopes your look over the city on to the port town in the
                        shore, and the Harbor. The last day we ran away from the conference and took
                        a long walk over the hills getting close to the wild flowers and getting
                        photographs of some most exquisitely beautiful, superb trees. The courts of
                        this community have decided that no clients of mine need pay for my services
                        (a part of the game of course) so I am not bothering my head in my
                        accustomed architectural field, i.e., the practice of architecture in my own
                        name) but am amusing myself with the flora than which there is none more
                        interesting nor beautiful.</p>
                    <p>It is still impossible to write of our experiences here. We are sheep marked
                        for the slaughter but go on cheerfully bleating and they haven't found our
                        bare heel yet. When they do we'll hop into some other field. I hope you
                        girls are all reading history. I started in the minute the war began and
                        I've learned a few things I can tell you. From what I hear the people of the
                        U.S. are the most ignorant in the world in that field. One book was by a
                        Maori of New Zealand. <note>This last sentence is handwritten.</note></p>
                    <p>Walt's sister <note>Genevieve</note> and her husband Roy Lippincott and two
                        year old little girl, Alstan, have just finished building a toy of a house
                        in the prettiest suburb of Melbourne - Heidelberg - on the bank of the River
                        Yarra and looking down and out over the hills to the mountains, and we are
                        now tucking in plants as fast as we can. In the next letter I shall be able
                        to send photos of the Catholic College at the Melbourne University which is
                        now drawing close to completion. It is sure a stately building. We are
                        planting the shrubbery there too, ten acres of it, as the grading is now in
                        shape. One doesn't have to wait long here either for results so in a year or
                        so it will be looking very lovely.</p>

                        do so hang on to things grown "at home" which most of them are no good here
                        compared with the natives. Bushels of love, Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>1917 - December, 20 - Heidelberg - Dearest Clarmyra, Walter (the gentleman
                        with the pink hair as you used to call him) and I are staying at the
                        Lippincotts for a few weeks now - until Genevieve gets a girl, and until the
                        planting is done. We have all been digging to beat the band. I myself put in
                        83 geranium slips one day, and Walter and George Elgh who was here over
                        Sunday put in a lot of shrubs, etc., all Saturday and Sunday. Walt has
                        started a seed bed which will keep us busy for a long time if all goes well.
                        Roy spends his time mostly on a vegetable garden of which Walt is very
                        scornful but which the rest of us thoroughly approve. We're putting in lemon
                        and orange and grape fruit trees and almonds and passion fruit and logan
                        berries. Fortunately things grow for Walt so we're likely to have <hi
                            rend="ul">some</hi> garden.</p>
                    <p>I have had an attack of the colly-wabbles <note>collywobbles,
                            gastrointestinal upset</note> and Walt has been away for ten days and
                        won't be back for four more and I want my mama and my sister and my baby
                        child. However I don't want them enough to risk their being mined
                            <note>their ship hitting a submarine mine, a submerged explosive?</note>
                        so we'll have to make the best of it. But the days don't go swiftly when one
                        has been sick and is alone and has been terribly disappointed. My what a
                        lugubrious letter I am writing. Was sorry Mr. King O'Malley (Minister of
                        Home affairs in charge of Canberra) didn't see you all but he slipped across
                        the States very quietly satisfied to see his brother and to eat ice cream
                        and I am sure was glad to get back here which is really home to him now. He
                        has been a Member of Parliament ever since there was a parliament and enjoys
                        the game. If they could prove he is an American they could collect all his
                        15 years' salary. He says he was born in Canada though they lived in the

                    <p>GEORGE V. HARVEY, GROVELAND AVENUE.</p>
                    <p>By now we are beginning to realize the importance, the necessity, of unified
                        control of large areas of land. This is one of the major problems we shall
                        have so solve if our civilization is to remain healthy. Nothing short of the
                        correct threefold organization of our communities can meet this requirement.
                        There was such control in the days of the hill cities of Italy which are
                        such outstandingly beautiful things. But that type cannot satisfy people who
                        have once tasted this so very modern dish called "equity." </p>
                    <p>Nor can the other extreme which enabled the Political Organization to collect
                        the total unearned increment solve this problem since that would make the
                        Nation the owner of the land and the land values would be spent either in
                        building up a powerful military organ or in pauperizing certain groups by
                        doling out these moneys to those who on small acreages cannot compete in the
                        market with those who handle great areas by mechanization.</p>
                    <p>Only by adding two other organizations, one to effect Mutuality and one to
                        effect Liberty, to the political whose only function is to effect Equity,
                        can the management of our communities become so flexible as to be able to
                        place large areas of land or large sums of money, unearned increment, in the
                        hands of individuals of ability to give them control for designing and
                        bringing about planned areas to meet the expanding needs of growing
                        communities.</p>
                    <p>We show you various attempts to bring about such important results but too
                        often the weight thrown on the shoulders of individual owners has been too
                        great for fruition, and splendid beginnings have come to naught or dragged
                        at an impossibly slow pace. Only in Canberra has the goal been reached and
                        there only in one of the two branches, that of the layout of the system of
                        circulation itself and here as</p>

                    <p>everywhere else lies the threat of consummated totalitarianism.</p>
                    <p>The Harvey subdivision consists of 109 acres of land, 292 lots, 60 by 160
                        feet, the land varying from approximately level to rolling hills. This calls
                        for curved streets to take full advantage of simple construction of roads on
                        easy grades and of the natural charm for the grouping of buildings. A church
                        and a Community House are at the top of the hill strategically approached
                        from the station.</p>
                    <p>All the blocks have interior parks and play fields, and all the street
                        intersections have the silent cops <note>policemen?</note> of park triangles
                        making traffic safe. On the whole straight roads are a crime on sloping
                        country just as on the whole curved roads are silly and confusing on flat
                        land.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In connection with the Federal Capital, Canberra, (accent on the Can) there
                        were three major time and energy absorbing incidents.</p>
                    <p>1 - from 1914 -<lb/> For months and years a Minister and Parliamentary Works
                        Committee completely obstructive.</p>
                    <p>2 - in 1917 -<lb/> A Royal Commission absorbing for 9 months the time and
                        energy of two Ministers, of Mr. Griffin, and of the Home Affairs Officials.</p>
                    <p>3 - The next 3 years -<lb/> Reappointment of the Director of Design and
                        Construction, a drive to establish the road system and the focal centers.</p>
                    <p>Then Mr. Griffin's resignation, Mr. <note>William Morris</note> Hughes
                        gazetting the plan which meant that nothing could be altered except by an
                        act of Parliament. The only acts were for the removal of one or two roads
                        the officials had introduced on the pretext that they were necessary for
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>On the 24th of June 1915, Mr. <note>William Oliver</note> Archibald, Minister
                        of Home Affairs, obtained Parliamentary authority to refer the City Railway
                        and Dams for Ornamental Waters to the Public Works Committee. This meant
                        endless months on the witness stand for Griffin. His amazing knowledge of
                        all the sciences connected with community planning, and they are endless,
                        now served him well, for through all these years of quizzing by Officials
                        and Experts they never caught him in an error though he made no pretense of
                        infallibility nor of being expert in these various technical realms. What he
                        asked for was to be allowed to employ certain experts to carry out the
                        sewage system, etc. The system the officials put in later proved to be no
                        good - a sewage farm method for which the soil was not proper.</p>
                    <p>During the 3rd Ministry <note>Cook, 1913-14; Fisher, 1914-15, Hughes, 1915-
                        </note> that Griffin was under a very astonishing thing happened. One of the
                        Cabinet Ministers - Mr. <note>King</note> O'Malley of the Home Affairs
                        Department permitted one of the other Ministers to attack his Department, so
                        a Royal Commission was called for by Mr. <note>William</note> Webster,</p>
                    <pb n="208"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 208 ====]</p>
                    <p>the Postmaster General, to investigate Mr. O'Malley's Department, the Home
                        Affairs Department which was the one which had charge of the Federal
                        Capital. The perfection of the ingenuity for deviltry of the whole British
                        machinery is again evidenced in the fact that no High Court Judge is
                        required to take on the function of judge in a Royal Commission. Since the
                        Federal Capital had been going on for some two years now, everyone knew it
                        would not be easy to give the officials a clean slate and only once in the
                        history of the Empire had a Royal Commission condemned the Civil Service.
                        Those in the game knew also that life would no longer be easy for anyone who
                        put himself wrong with Officialdom so every one of the national Chief
                        Justices refused to serve. Finally a barrister of Sydney <note>Wilfred
                            Blacket</note> was persuaded to take on the task. We ourselves are
                        inclined to think that his failure to achieve conspicuous success later was
                        probably due to the antipathies he doubtless aroused in giving judgments
                        against the officials.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster refused to have legal assistance to which he was entitled in
                        carrying on the attack. He was one of those remarkable men whose personal
                        qualities tend to blind our eyes to the nefarious nature of the British
                        system. As a child in England, he had worked in the mines harnessed to a
                        cart and on his hands and knees in the low channels he had dragged out the
                        coal carts. He came to Australia in his youth and forewarned his prospective
                        bride that the time would come when it might be hard for her to adjust her
                        life to his when he became a Minister of the Crown which was his intention.
                        He had achieved that at just this critical time of Griffin's hitherto single
                        handed fight (not that for there was always James Alexander Smith) against
                        an Empire. For nine solid months Mr. Webster called up the officials and
                        pounded at them until they had all exposed themselves so completely that no
                        one who followed the evidence could come to any other conclusion than that
                        expressed by Mr. Blacket in his report condemning all of the</p>
                    <pb n="209"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 209 ====]</p>
                    <p>heads concerned in the work of the Federal Capital.</p>
                    <p>As a result of this achievement and under a sympathetic Minister of the
                        Department, Griffin was able to get actual work done in the construction of
                        the Capital City. For the first two years he had been up against a stone
                        wall fighting, as he recognized, not individuals, but an institution.</p>
                    <p>My purpose in presenting these dry chapters is to give my fellow citizens
                        firsthand information of how Bureaucracy, established Bureaucracy, no matter
                        how desirable it may seem in its early stages, really works. Great credit is
                        due to this outstanding Britisher, Mr. Wilfred Blacket, for taking on this
                        unwelcome and dangerous task. Upwards of 40,000 questions were put and
                        answered and nearly 400 Exhibits, some very voluminous, were tendered in the
                        evidence. The public, of course, got only such glimpses as were afforded by
                        press quotations as evidence was given. The matter of the 400 foot plan was
                        scarcely commented on. In fact I find no comments in the press except those
                        officially inspired a year before the Commission began.</p>
                    <p>In an interview with Mr. Archibald on the 9th December 1914, Griffin had
                        informed him as follows:- <bibl>Royal Commission on Federal Capital
                            Administration, W.B. Griffin evidence:-</bibl></p>
                    <p>To Mr. Archibald - I informed you that I had already worked out the railway
                        levels, and that these were available to you, as also were the levels of the
                        lakes and other features to which you then specifically referred. There was
                        ready, I also notified you, you may remember, all the necessary information
                        to enable the effective work to be proceeded with at once. Possibly
                        consideration of these items involving, of course, the features directly
                        dependent thereon, may be helpful to you at this juncture; if so they are at
                        your disposal.</p>
                    <p>Griffin - That letter conveyed the portion of what I put before the Minister
                            <hi rend="ul">which was omitted from the notes of the officers</hi>. The
                        following letter from the Minister to me states that fact:-</p>

                    <p>From Mr. <note>William Oliver</note> Archibald - Melbourne, 1st March,
                        1915<lb/> Dear Sir, Your communication of the 25th February is at hand
                        pointing out that you intimated on 9th December last that you had available
                        the levels of the Railway, Lakes and other features specially referred to in
                        your design for the Federal Capital City. I cannot find any record in the
                        correspondence of such an intimation, and so far as the notes made at the
                        time and my recollection and that of the officers present are concerned you
                        do not appear to have made such information clear at the interview I had
                        with you on 9th December last.</p>
                    <p>(Yet for a year following he refused to accept this information and
                        continually called for a 400 foot to the inch plan which would be
                        unnecessary whereas the 200 feet to the inch plan was already prepared
                        sufficiently for various works. In fact the premiated plan was on the scale
                        of 400 feet to the inch so they already had it.)</p>
                    <p>Question number 230 - Walter Burley Griffin to Mr. <note>William</note>
                        Webster - It was repeatedly urged that the Minister was waiting for levels
                        from me. The statement was made in Parliament and in the press in such a way
                        as to create the impression that I was delinquent. My friends and people on
                        the street were asking me, "Why do you not meet the requirements of your
                        Minister?" All the time I was pressing on with the work as fast as I could.
                        The information which I was asked to supply involved a great deal more work
                        than the Minister evidently realized, despite my repeated explanations as to
                        the amount of work involved. If I had had a clear course this work would not

                        unnecessary work and involved unnecessary delay. It was not my fault that
                        delay occurred. I asked for assistance for this work and it was authorized
                        in November.... That is the only time when assistance was readily given
                        (i.e., when it was on unnecessary work). It was specifically granted for the
                        purpose of developing the plan which I said was not necessary. The effect of
                        this assistance was only to perform a work which would have the result of
                        delaying my work.</p>

                    <p>1202 - Archibald to Griffin - Surely you could form the opinion that if a
                        layman asked for a plan of the place, it was not essential for him to have
                        all the drawings. That would be a matter for an engineer, not for me. Did
                        you think that I was going through all the drawings?</p>
                    <p>(Contradiction. First wants one <note>i.e., plan</note> engineers could work
                        from but now says be wanted one that would simply satisfy the curiosity of a
                        layman.)</p>
                    <p>Griffin - But you asked me for a revised design, a complete plan which
                        embraced all the works - works which could not be determined without the
                        necessary investigations which would occupy a considerable time.</p>
                    <p>1203 - Archibald - And it took you six months?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - You finally limited your request to work which I could supply to
                        you within three or four months.</p>
                    <p>1204 - Archibald - After your letter of the 14th December, 1914, which I
                        described as a bluff the other day I replied on the 19th December and asked
                        for some levels of the major works - bridges, main avenues, railways, lakes,
                        etc. Was I doing you an injustice when I said that you were anxious to give
                        me information but in homeopathic doses?</p>
                    <p> Griffin - I do not like the term "homeopathic doses." I said that I could
                        prepare the works individually for presentation to you but I could not
                        prepare a plan showing the whole of them.</p>
                    <p>1205 - By the Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - The question is whether you
                        withheld the full information you possessed and gave only inconsiderable
                        parts of it?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I say emphatically that I did not withhold information. I was
                        giving it as fast as it could be prepared. I was anxious to do so in order
                        to facilitate the work. What I objected to was having to hold back the work
                        pending the receipt of all these things which would take an unreasonable
                        amount of time and occasion considerable expense and preliminary
                        investigation.</p>
                    <p>1210 - Archibald - Then you could have given me a plan without going to
                        Canberra?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I had the plans ready for you when you came into office.</p>
                    <p>1213 - Archibald - I have called your attention to the bluffing letter I
                        received from you which appears on page 50 of the Parliamentary paper, and
                        my</p>

                    <p>reply of the 19 December in which I asked for levels. To what should I
                        attribute the long delay, from October to March in answering the simple
                        request I made?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - There was no delay.</p>
                    <p>1214 - Archibald - It took six months to get the levels?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - Yes. The information that I had was at your disposal at any time. I
                        offered my services at any time and offered to expedite any portion of the
                        work which you wished to have expedited and you did not avail yourself of my
                        offer.</p>
                    <p>1230 - Archibald - Would you be surprised to learn that it was the industrial
                        situation which confronted the Government and myself that led me to ask you
                        for this plan?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I did realize the situation and I strongly urged upon you that
                        works in the City should be developed without any delay.</p>
                    <p>1232 - Archibald - Do you seriously contend that they could have been gone on
                        with unless the Government had a plan of them.</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I knew, as a matter of fact, that the Government had a plan of the
                        city and what I was endeavoring to do was to prepare plans of works as
                        rapidly as possible with the object of having them put in hand.</p>
                    <p>1232 - Archibald - You have already admitted that the Government had no plan
                        with the levels, although the situation I have described was confronting
                        them at that time?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - You finally resolved your requests to me into a plan for levels
                        generally extended over the city which I expedited to the utmost. I had to
                        point out at the same time that that was not necessary to the putting in
                        hand of works. The Government had a plan of the Capital before them and
                        plans of any or all of the works that they desired should be gone on with,
                        could be prepared for them. Any particular work could be investigated and
                        worked out without delay but to hold up particular works, pending the
                        completion of the designs of all and the determination of structural levels
                        throughout, would seriously delay the progress of the Capital.</p>
                    <p>1234 - Archibald - Do you think I wanted the plan I asked for for any but the
                        practical purpose of pushing on with the city?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - You stated that,</p>
                    <pb n="213"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 213 ====]</p>
                    <p>I believe, to me; but I tried to point out that, in my opinion, that was not
                        the most practical way in which to push on with the city.</p>
                    <p>1235 - Archibald - Did not the action which I took when I got the plans
                        indicate the reason why I wanted it and had wanted it for months?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I understood that when you got the plan of levels you were going to
                        put the works in hand. As a matter of fact you did not put the works in
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>1236 - Archibald - When I received the report from Colonel <note>Percy
                        Thomas</note> Owen about the lakes did not that convey to your mind that I
                        was anxious to get on?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - It seemed to me that it was raising issues and questions tending to
                        discourage the assumption of works.</p>
                    <p>1237 - Archibald - Did it ever strike you that as a Minister of the Crown
                        responsible to the Cabinet and the country, I had to explain to Parliament
                        what the lakes were?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - Yes and I was pressing upon you all the time for an opportunity to
                        explain the works to you.</p>
                    <p>1238 - Archibald - When I received the report from Colonel Owen about the
                        lakes did not that indicate to you that I wanted the plan for which I had
                        asked in order to get on with the work?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - It did not impress me that that would be the result of the
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>1239 - Archibald - I am under the impression that I instructed that action
                        should be taken within a week after I got the plan because as a layman I did
                        not think that there would be enough water to fill the lakes?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I am surprised that you as a layman concluded that there was not
                        enough water to fill the lakes.</p>
                    <p>(To get the real flavor of this evidence one needs to know Griffin
                        personally, his always quiet, courteous, gentle ways. As one of his worst
                        enemies said, "You could never make Mr. Griffin angry.")</p>
                    <p>1240 - Archibald - Have you gone into the question of evaporation in the dry
                        parts of Australia?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I have consulted with those who have made a close study of this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>1241 - Archibald - Would you be surprised to learn that engineers of the
                        different States have never been able to satisfy the public concerning</p>
                    <pb n="214"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 214 ====]</p>
                    <p>the data regarding evaporation?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I know that many elements enter into this problem and that it is
                        one of these highly specialized matters that require a great deal of
                        experience before an opinion can be given. But may I suggest that while you
                        were asking me for this plan of the levels, that on the 9th December I gave
                        you the levels of the lakes, and I should have thought that you might have
                        been utilizing that period to make the investigations if you wanted to get
                        on with the work.</p>
                    <p>1247 - Archibald - Where was there any lack of courtesy on my part in
                        submitting these proposals to the Public Works Committee.</p>
                    <p>Griffin - The plans submitted to the Public Works Committee <hi rend="ul"
                            >were not of my design</hi> and you had not consulted me about then at
                        all or given me an opportunity to explain the features of my design.</p>
                    <p>1248 - Archibald - Do you not think that if I had consulted you it would have
                        led to further delay?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - No, I think it would have facilitated the work very such. Had you
                        consulted me we might have had a definite proposal to make to the Public
                        Works Committee and as part of my plan it could have been gone on with.</p>
                    <p>1249 - Archibald - Did it not strike you that in referring this matter to the
                        Public Works Committee you would have had an opportunity of submitting your
                        plan?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - Certainly but it would have taken over a year to discuss the
                        various questions connected with the matter before the works Committee.</p>
                    <p>1250 - By the Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - Have Members of the Public
                        Works Committee seen it?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - They have had the matter before them <hi rend="ul">for a year</hi>
                        and they are not through with it yet. They have not yet taken the whole of
                        the evidence.</p>
                    <p>1251 - Archibald - Do you think it would have expedited matters if I had
                        consulted you on the subject?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - Certainly I do think so. The determining of these matters before
                        they went to the Public Works Committee would, by defining the scope of the
                        inquiry, have given that body a definite understanding as to what they were
                        to report upon.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 215 ====]</p>
                    <p>1253 - Archibald - Did it ever strike you that I had a strong public reason
                        in asking for the plan, and that I was acting within my rights?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I never questioned whether you were acting within your rights or
                        not in asking for the level plans. I supplied the information.</p>
                    <p>1254 - Archibald - Do you not think that a Government should be careful not
                        to create more circumlocution?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - Yes decidedly. In Government work there is a general tendency to
                        circumlocution.</p>
                    <p>1255 - Archibald - Was it not desirable that, in order not to duplicate
                        reports, I should get them from the departmental engineers direct and
                        without coming through your office?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - The result had been that reports prepared without my advice have
                        all had to be recast when my advice has been given. If the officers had
                        obtained their information from me it would have been correct as to the
                        requirements of the city plan.</p>
                    <p>1256 - Archibald - Do you contend that Cabinet and Parliament have no right
                        to modify this plan?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I have said repeatedly that I do not contend that.</p>
                    <p>2356 - <hi rend="ul">Mr.</hi>
                        <note>William</note>
                        <hi rend="ul">Webster</hi> - What use was ever made of the 400 foot to the
                        inch plan afterwards?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - No use was ever made of it. In my office I have gone on developing
                        levels to a greater extent, and designing, elaborating and estimating works
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>2357 - Webster - After the plan was completed do you know of any work that
                        was carried out or designed in consequence of the Minister having the fuller
                        information that it supplied?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I do not. Reports on the Railway and bridges were prepared by the
                        departmental officers on these levels.</p>
                    <p>2358 - Webster - Do you know of any works initiated or carried out as the
                        result of that plan?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - No.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster to Mr. <note>Thomas?</note> Hill:-</p>
                    <p>21983 - Webster - Will you read your answer to question 20588?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes.</p>
                    <p>Webster - You see that the Minister (Mr. <note>W.H.</note> Kelly) in his
                        minutes of the 31st July says that Mr. Griffin is to lay out the Federal
                        City; Do you suggest that his direction could not be carried out?</p>
                    <pb n="216"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 216 ====]</p>
                    <p>Hill - I think if Mr. Griffin had laid it out he would have worked not from
                        it but from larger plans, and his instructions would have been issued from
                        those larger scale plans. I have some recollection of his mentioning in that
                        interview with Mr. Archibald that they thought a portion of the city should
                        be developed from a 200 feet to the inch plan at the time. My recollection
                        is that he stated he had some plan of 200 feet to the inch ready to proceed
                        with.</p>
                    <p>(Elsewhere denied he ever heard anything about a 200 foot plan.)</p>
                    <p>21984 - Webster - What you said then was correct?</p>
                    <p>Hill - It is not correct there. I have some recollection of his mentioning in
                        that interview that he had plans 200 feet to the inch to go on with.</p>
                    <p>21985 - Webster - Mr. Griffin said at the interview that he had a plan of 200
                        feet to the inch for some portion of the work?</p>
                    <p>Hill - On p. 48 (Exhibit "A1") it is stated that Mr. Griffin said that he was
                        proceeding with the planning on the lines of the levels and sections.</p>
                    <p>21988 - Webster - Do you remember that he said he had worked out a 200 feet
                        to the inch plan then?</p>
                    <p>Hill - I remember just a remark that he had some of it at 200 feet to the
                        inch. (admission)</p>
                    <p>21991 - Webster - Did Mr. Griffin mention that he had a plan of 800
                            <note>sic, possibly 400?</note> feet to the inch?</p>
                    <p>Hill - I have some recollection of some plan but whether it was 800
                            <note>sic, possibly 400?</note> feet to the inch exactly or not I would
                        not definitely say.</p>
                    <p>21992 - Webster - Was that put in your report?</p>
                    <p>Hill - It is so mentioned in my report, and I am prepared to say to the best
                        of my recollection that that plan was not mentioned on that definite scale
                        number at that interview.</p>
                    <p>22002 - Webster - Did you hear the Minister indicate that he wanted those
                        levels?</p>
                    <p>Hill - I heard the Minister say that he wanted the levels of the railways.</p>
                    <p>22003 - Webster - Mr. Griffin having those levels developed on a 200 feet to
                        the inch basis do you ask me to believe that Mr. Griffin would not inform
                        the minister of that fact?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Any reference to the 200 feet plan was purely in regard to road work.</p>

                    <p>22004 - Webster - When the Minister <note>W.O. Archibald</note> had told Mr.
                        Griffin that he wanted the railway levels, did you hear Mr. Griffin say that
                        he already had those developed on a 200 feet to the inch plan?</p>
                    <p>Hill - No.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. Griffin's letter read shortly after is conclusive evidence that they
                        know he had these levels and was offering them to the Minister who refused
                        them.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster to Mr. <note>Charles</note> Scrivener (surveyor).</p>
                    <p>34970 - Webster - If the city could have been plotted from the basic plans
                        could it not have been plotted from the photographic reproductions?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - I think it has been made clear that I never knew of the existence
                        of the basic plan.</p>
                    <p>(Nonsense. The fact of the photographic plan is proof of the existence of an
                        original from which the photograph is taken.)</p>
                    <p>34971 - By the Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - Do you say the city could
                        have been plotted from the basic plan of 800 <note>sic, possibly 400?</note>
                        feet to the inch?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - I think it could, but I think it would have been necessary even
                        with that to make a larger plan.</p>
                    <p>34972 - Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - If it could have been plotted
                        from the basic plan, could it have been plotted from the photographic
                        reproduction?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - No, you have to have the scale.</p>
                    <p>(Quibbling. Scale of no importance. Layout is done from figures.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster to Mr. Scrivener. -</p>
                    <p>20722 - Webster - Did you ever hear of such work being laid out in any other
                        way than by figures?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - Yes; and plenty without any figures.</p>
                    <p>20723 - Webster - Would you consider that a possible way for the arrangement
                        of streets where there are curves?</p>
                    <p> Scrivener - It depends on the class of information you have on the plan.</p>
                    <p>20724 - Webster - Would any scale enable you to lay out accurately on the
                        ground a plan which contains tangent lines of curves?</p>
                    <p> Scrivener - Yes, it may be done if the plan is very accurately drawn.</p>
                    <p>20733 - <note>Webster?</note> - Would you expect anybody to go about an
                        important scheme like this with a protractor?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - I do not know. I have seen people do funny things; but it is not
                        a reasonable thing to do.</p>
                    <pb n="218"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 218 ====]</p>
                    <p>(Yes it would be a funny thing to do but quite likely was done by officials.
                        When in hilly districts Griffin in his private practice made curved roads we
                        had to do the calculations in our private office and pay the surveyors as if
                        they had done them. They tried to get a law passed making curved roads
                        against the law, and this in this in hilly country.)</p>
                    <p>20734 - Webster - Previously you remember you forwarded the lithographed
                        extended plan?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - Yes.</p>
                    <p>20736 - <note>Webster?</note> - And that the coordinates were by no means
                        square?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - Some of those were very peculiar.</p>
                    <p>20736 - By the Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - The co-ordinates were by
                        no means square, is that so?</p>
                    <p> Scrivener - I do not know; but I think it very probable. I know some of
                        those were not square because some of them were drawn laterally and they
                        were in alternate directions. I say again that within an individual square
                        you allow for that expansion, and you can get a co-ordinate even from a
                        distorted plan with quite reasonable accuracy if you use it the right way.
                        But that has nothing to do with me and Mr. Griffin must know the trouble we
                        took to try to get them.</p>
                    <p>20737 - By Mr. Griffin - Will you read the last clause or my request of 14th
                        December, 1914?</p>
                    <p><note>Scrivener</note> - Yes. - (Witness read same, Exhibit "B188")</p>
                    <p>20738 - Griffin - That is a request for reference original drawing plan where
                        lithographs were in error?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - Yes, I see that, but I know nothing further about it.</p>
                    <p>20739 - Griffin - Your answer in your letter of the 19th December, 1914. Will
                        you read the last clause?</p>
                    <p> Scrivener - Yes, it reads, "The maps sent are not much inferior in accuracy
                        to the original plan, and distances between stations may be obtained by
                        scale within quite reasonable limits." I say in my letter, "These copies
                        have been selected from others, and are as nearly accurate as any that are
                        likely to be produced." This refers to the Whatman plans; it does not refer
                        to any city plan so far as I know.</p>
                    <p>20740 - Griffin - If that applies to these maps produced, then you did not
                        answer my request in my previous letter?</p>
                    <p> Scrivener - I do not know, I can</p>
                    <pb n="219"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 219 ====]</p>
                    <p>not give that evidence.</p>
                    <p>(That was the case however.)</p>
                    <p>20743 - Griffin - When you gave these bearings you were aware the drawings I
                        was working on showed co-ordinates with the meridian at <note>Mount</note>
                        Ainslie?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - If I recollect aright we drew two sets of co-ordinates: We drew
                        sets of co-ordinates with <note>Mount</note> Stromlo, and we advised that
                        the co-ordinates in blue had their origin at Stromlo and were on the Stromlo
                        meridian.</p>
                    <p>20744 - Griffin - These being co-ordinates from Ainslie, it would be
                        perfectly impossible to plot from the co-ordinates from Ainslie any bearings
                        depending on the Stromlo meridian?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - You would want to know the variation between the meridian of
                        Stromlo and of Ainslie - what the convergence of meridians between those two
                        stations was.</p>
                    <p>20745 - Griffin - That is a function of the latitude?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - It is a function of both latitude and longitude, principally
                        longitude.</p>
                    <p>20746 - Griffin - For any latitude it varies a certain angle?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - Yes.</p>
                    <p>20747 - Griffin - If we had to correct the bearings of the meridian of
                        Stromlo you are aware that the whole design was in error?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - No, I am not; I know nothing about it.</p>
                    <p>20748 - Griffin - What would be the divergence between the meridians of
                        Stromlo and of Ainslie - the actual divergence?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - It is about six minutes of arc I should say.</p>
                    <p>20749 - Griffin - In my letter to you of the 24th December, I pointed out to
                        you that the actual convergence was about fifteen minutes and not six
                        minutes as calculated on which we were trying to lay out the city?</p>
                    <p>Scrivener - But the meridian of Ainslie was not the meridian of Ainslie; it
                        is the adopted meridian of Ainslie, not the true meridian. My recollection
                        is that the convergence should have been from the end of the south base. We
                        have the correct meridian no doubt; but I do not remember the circumstances.</p>

                    <p>designs were called for and one was accepted. As the years revolved the
                        acceptor was invited to Australia to supervise the lay-out on the basis of
                        the ....adopted scheme. (The officials continually spoke of the revised plan
                        but there was none such. The original plan was adopted.) By the slow process
                        sanctioned by immemorial official usage the plans have gone back to the
                        original designer for another revision. While the difference which has
                        arisen between Mr. Griffin and the Minister may be left till time had thrown
                        light on the curiously tortuous methods through which the plans ....have had
                        to pass, there is quite enough evidence available to show that a settlement
                        ought to have been arrived at many months ago. The country is entitled to a
                        plain statement of the facts, and of the departmental reasons for the
                        unaccountable block that has occurred. If the fixed and dominant purpose was
                        to postpone indefinitely the creation of Canberra into the actual seat of
                        Government, it could not have succeeded better. (This of course was what
                        London desired.)</p>
                    <p>(Responsibility - All this re their insistence that the minister did not get
                        his advice on these matters from the officials. Archibald on one side
                        swearing that he considered the advice of his officials as all sufficient -
                        the officers swearing that none of them advised the Minister in any of these
                        matters.)</p>
                    <p>(In the general scramble to shuffle responsibility we find the following
                        statements. All officers of course deny all responsibility for any
                        Ministerial act no matter how they may have misinterpreted facts to him. It
                        did actually delay the work in Griffin's office by turning his attention and
                        time and that of his office to useless work and at the same time the demands
                        on time and strength to such an extent and in such a way as would break down
                        the physical strength of some men and the mental powers of others.)</p>
                    <p>155 - To Mr. Webster - Griffin - My premiated design was on a scale of 400
                        feet to the inch. So was that of the Department. Both were based on</p>
                    <pb n="221"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 221 ====]</p>
                    <p>the same surveys. The contour surveys were lithographed on that scale, and
                        the conditions of the competition required the plan to be drawn on those
                        lithographs. My basic plan was drawn on a scale of 800 <note>sic, possibly
                            200?</note> feet to the inch (the one including the surrounding
                        districts) because that was the scale on which the original contour surveys
                        had been reproduced when I came here. This was a much more convenient size
                        to work on. That was done by the Department. The original plottings had been
                        reproduced in the smaller scale as well as in the larger. I used the smaller
                        scale as much more easily worked and showing the same facts. All the figures
                        were legible on that scale. To produce a plan on the 400 ft scale on the
                        lines of my basic plan would involve replotting and redrawing the whole, but
                        the draughting would not take a great deal of time. Merely to reproduce a
                        plan on the 400 ft scale would mean four or five weeks' drafting. I could
                        see no advantage in the larger scale for the purpose required then, and it
                        is a more unwieldy size.</p>
                    <p>156 - To the Commissioner <note>Blacket</note> - Griffin - Presumably the
                        premiated design was required on the larger scale for purposes of
                        exhibition.</p>
                    <p>157 - To Mr. Webster - Griffin - There were no advantages to be gained by the
                        continuous requests for a 400 ft to the inch plan. The scale was quite
                        immaterial.</p>
                    <p>20593 - To Mr. Thomas Hill - Griffin - What particular engineering work was
                        intended or desired to be put in hand at that time?</p>
                    <p>Hill - I am not aware of any. There was no proposition to do any work in the
                        city that time.</p>
                    <p>(Admission)</p>
                    <p>20594 - Griffin - After this 400 foot to the inch plan was prepared, did it
                        enable any work to be proceeded with that had been before then delayed?</p>
                    <p>Hill - No. I am not aware that any work on that plan has yet been put in
                        hand, except Adelaide Avenue, which has been in course of construction
                        during the last few months.</p>

                    <p>(Notice this was the 20,594th question.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Webster to Mr. Hill - On page 70 of the printed papers (Exhibit "A1")
                        there is reference to referring to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
                        Public Works for their report, city railways and dams for ornamental waters,
                        incident to the schematic plan of Canberra prepared by Mr. Griffin. That has
                        been delayed 18 months through reference to the Public Works Committee.</p>
                    <p>22028 - Mr. Webster - That is the first reference to the Public Works'
                        delaying of the carrying out of the works at Canberra for months and months?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hill. - I could only say that that work has not been proceeded with in
                        the city since reference was made.</p>
                    <p>(Admission)</p>
                    <p>22029 - Webster - And so, on this 400 feet to the inch plan, you presented to
                        the Public Works Committee your estimate of the cost was £405,000?</p>
                    <p>Hill - I used a plan of 400 feet to the inch as a basis in preparing the
                        these figures.</p>
                    <p>24992 - Webster - Will you read paragraph 18, page 12 or the Parliamentary
                        Supplementary papers, to Exhibit "A1", from the word "Survey"?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes. It reads:- "The survey that Scrivener has completed is awaited by
                        Mr. Griffin to enable a general design to be fixed and the workmen's
                        location made out. Kindly expedite." That was on the 30th July, 1914.</p>
                    <p>24933 - Webster - Was it at this time when Mr. Griffin was engaged on this
                        work that the idea of getting him on the 400 ft. plan occurred?</p>
                    <p>Hill - No. (Contradiction paragraph 25000.)</p>
                    <p>24994 - Webster - Do you notice paragraph (a) on page 48 of Exhibit "A1"?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes.</p>
                    <p>24995 - Webster - Is not that an indication that Mr. Griffin was constantly
                        pressing forward preparations for workmen's cottages?</p>
                    <p>Hill - His purpose is stated in that memorandum.</p>
                    <p>24996 - Webster - Is that what you read the purport of the paragraph to mean,
                        that he was pressing for preparations for providing homes for the workmen?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes, that is what one would read the purport to be.</p>

                    <p>24997 - Webster - On page 18 of the supplementary papers to Exhibit "A1" you
                        see that Mr. Kelly is taking a hand to try to get the general design fixed
                        and the workmen's location laid out?</p>
                    <p>Hill - That is an instruction to the Administrator that his desire is to
                        enable a design to be fixed, and the workmen's location to be laid out.</p>
                    <p>24998 - Webster - Are you aware that Mr. Griffin was occupied on these
                        workmen's cottage plans in September, 1914?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes. He states that on the 14th September, he had draughtsmen at work.</p>
                    <p>24999. - Webster - And that subsequently, on <hi rend="ul">the 9th
                        December</hi>, that matter is again referred to?</p>
                    <p>Hill - Yes - Page 48, Exhibit "A1." </p>
                    <p>25000 - Webster - When was it that Mr. Griffin was asked to proceed with the
                        400 ft to the inch plan?</p>
                    <p>Hill - On the <hi rend="ul">9th December 1914</hi>.</p>
                    <p>6163 - Mr. Webster to Mr. Kelly - What was your object in bringing out Mr.
                        Griffin?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kelly - Primarily it was to enable me to look into these criticisms and
                        into the question of the lay-out and completion of the city. Of course, I
                        wanted to see Mr. Griffin before I could come to any definite decision in
                        regard to him. A man might be a brilliant designer and yet be possessed of
                        no practical execution. But as soon as I saw Mr. Griffin I realized that he
                        was a practical man as well as one who is possessed of the gifts with which
                        we know he is endowed.</p>
                    <p>6183 - Mr. Kelly - In fairness to Mr. Griffin, I must say that he never posed
                        as an actual practicing specialist in sewerage matters. His theory was that,
                        in addition to having the general knowledge that should be acquired before
                        setting out on any plan, one should secure also the very best expert
                        knowledge obtainable. His investigations, therefore, were preliminary and of
                        a very broad character.</p>
                    <p>6184 - Mr. Kelly - At an early date he made some casual references to the
                        possibility of things in connection with water having been wrong. He did not
                        dogmatize, but he thought that possibly things were wrong in connection with
                        the water scheme. There had never been</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 224a ====]</p>
                    <p>suggestion of amendment of <hi rend="ul">his general design which was
                            completed, approved and presented to Parliament</hi>. What he was
                        engaged on was the preparation of working drawings. These did involve
                        adaptations to surveys not perfected when the design was prepared. The
                        adaptations would develop as work proceeded and it would be quite impossible
                        for him to submit any general indication of such adaptations as would be
                        required in actual work.</p>
                    <p>1725 - Mr. Webster to Mr. Griffin - You seriously maintain that 90 per cent
                        of your time has been occupied in what you call defensive operations?</p>
                    <p>Griffin - I maintain that 90 per cent is the very smallest percentage which I
                        could possible estimate.</p>
                    <p>(A similar statement was made by Mr. Meade, an American who was called upon
                        for the New South Wales irrigation projects.)</p>
                    <p>And so on for 9 months. Thus does Parliamentary Government work. The feelings
                        of the officials, condemned on every count, wasting money, falsifying books,
                        etc., were soothed by advancement in position, or salary or titles, but they
                        were out of the Federal Capital.</p>
                    <p>When there is a Royal Commission the law requires that 200 copies of the
                        evidence shall be printed. The day they were printed Mr. Webster got one for
                        himself and one for Mr. Griffin. The next day all the rest were burned up.
                        Thus does parliamentary government work everywhere. <note>This last sentence

                        <hi rend="ul">THE CAUSE OF CONFUSION IN EUROPE NOW</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <note>William</note> Webster's speech, as he knew might happen, called
                        forth comment from the opposition, that such a situation certainly called
                        for a Royal Commission. After the adjournment, his own party were down on
                        him like a hive of angry bees, fuming at him for putting his own party in
                        such a position, laying them open to public condemnation, and threatened to
                        throw him out of the Ministry. His only answer was that in his judgment it
                        was the thing that had to be done. It was followed by a demand for an
                        investigation by a Royal Commission, the first stop in which was the
                        condemnation <note>commendation?, i.e., entrusting</note> of the
                        commissioner in whose hands the investigation should rest. The method of
                        choosing a Royal Commissioner is worth looking into, and the fact that this
                        case was an exception makes it possible to show what the general tendency of
                        the system is mostly because of its nature.</p>
                    <p>When a government feels that it is necessary to make an investigation it is
                        helpless in the matter of being able to place it before an impartial
                        judiciary. The judges of the Supreme Court are not required to take on a
                        royal commission unless they wish it, of course their refusal is supposed to
                        be on their having too much else to do, however the position rests with the
                        judges, naturally, as in this case when they scent the conflict with the
                        bureaucracy in which there is the risk of it being perfectly apparent to the
                        public that the bureaucracy is wrong. They will not be inclined to take upon
                        themselves the onus either of failing to condemn the officials or of
                        condemning then, and thus bringing down upon themselves the enmity of the
                        whole bureaucracy. For not only is it the opening up of opportunities, for
                        promotion rests particularly in the hands of the officials with the whole
                        press to back them, but they have every facility for injuring or destroying
                        the standing of any member of the community.</p>
                    <p>Six of the chief justices refused to act on this Royal Commission. No judge
                        could be found in the community who would accept the post. The system means
                        that as a rule no man will accept the</p>
                    <pb n="224c"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 224c ====]</p>
                    <p>position unless he has been offered sufficient inducement by one side or the
                        other to render the judgment to its advantage. A system so perfectly
                        arranged for the purpose of corruption will of course be corrupt as a rule
                        in its procedure. Marvelously, either because of the integrity of the
                        barrister who finally accepted the position of royal commissioner or because
                        of the marvelous case made by the Postmaster General, the commission
                        resulted in condemnation of the officials. That there could be no pressure
                        from the other side is apparent from the fact that they had no reward in
                        their hands nor within their reach in which they could possibly offer to
                        influence the commissioner.</p>
                    <p>It may be interesting to note the system of another of the judicial
                        departments, the county court, similarly and ingeniously organized to
                        facilitate corruption. Here the judges sit in certain courts in rotation,
                        but at any time one of them may be transferred (by what authority?) to
                        another court and another judge temporarily takes his place. This means that
                        if the officials or their friends wish to have a position made in advance of
                        the trial, all that is necessary is that some one of the group of judges
                        shall be their tool, since any of the other of the judges can be supplanted
                        at any required moment by their tool.</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances the unwary litigant is helpless in regard to an
                        appeal for the usual procedure of the court is to have no stenographic notes
                        taken of the case. This means that the judge at his desk jots down whatever
                        he feels inclined to which as in the case of our own experience, included
                        none of the evidence against the Civil Service, and would doubtless exclude
                        whatever was deemed advantageous to the other side. The verdict then becomes
                        a thing manufactured out of whole cloth, and, since there is no pleading of
                        the case or questioning of witnesses in the appeal, there is nothing on
                        which the higher court can base any reason for reversing the judgment - a
                        very simple, neat and effective system.</p>
                    <pb n="224d"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 224d ====]</p>
                    <p>The first point to be decided was whether the officials would be allowed
                        legal counsel for which they were asking permission. Mr. Webster was
                        undertaking to carry the burden of the Government investigation on his own
                        shoulders and felt there was no occasion for the government going to the
                        expense of supplying legal assistance which would only tend to obscure and
                        confuse facts which the government had the right to grant directly from its
                        officials. There the questioning was entirely done by the Postmaster General
                        before whom the various parties gave their evidence. His tremendous task in
                        bringing facts to the surface in spite of the twisting of these officials,
                        with their long experience with this art in the case where practically all
                        the evidence was necessarily on technical matters, was a most marvelous
                        feat.</p>
                    <p>His capacity was instanced in one branch of engineering after another, in
                        getting a statement to its essentials from the engineers with whom Mr.
                        Griffin had been connected and in understanding its bearing on the works
                        that had been executed by the officials, and so mastering it as to be
                        impossible to be confused, and to be able to hold to essential points
                        against all dodging, diluting and twisting of the officers who were of
                        course assisted by engineers friendly to themselves, resulted in the
                        exposure which showed the officers guilty of insubordination, incompetence,
                        wastefulness and dishonesty.</p>
                    <p>However before the report was out of the printers' hands although the
                        printing itself had been completed, a new election had been forced in which
                        the Minister of Home Affairs lost his seat, the Postmaster General
                        continuing in office only because his belief in the necessity for
                        conscription had led him to join with the opposite party in the formation of
                        a coalition Government. It would therefore still be necessary to hasten
                        another election to get rid of this last stumbling block, although in the
                        meantime every effort was made to discredit him and to force him out of the
                        Ministry. This they failed to bring about, so it was not until the following
                        year that they would be able</p>
                    <pb n="224e"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 224e ====]</p>
                    <p>to sweep the boards clear of the opponents of the Bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>During the first six years of Mr. Griffin's direction of the Federal Capital
                        construction, he was under 8 different Ministers of Home Affairs. We begin
                        to glimpse the truth that the changes from one party to another in the
                        Parliamentary System do not signify the sensitiveness of this system to
                        public opinion or control. The public has nothing whatever to do with
                        throwing the Party out of power, nor have they any power at any time to do
                        it, although some subterfuge is always used to make it appear to do so.
                        Their powerlessness to bring this about was illustrated recently in
                        Australia when during a campaign the Prime Minister was caught by the
                        ingenuity of a very conspicuous and able citizen and forced into making a
                        promise to the people that he would not introduce conscription without
                        referring it to the vote of the people and that if in this referendum the
                        vote was against conscription he would resign. The vote was against
                        conscription but Mr. <note>William Morris</note> Hughes continued to remain
                        in office. The method by which this was brought about was through the
                        safeguard of the colonial system by which in any real emergency the Governor
                        General, who has the final power, makes use of it. In this case since Hughes
                        was an entirely satisfactory tool of the London interests the game was for
                        him to resign, which he did thus was his pledge to the people supposed to be
                        kept. When however the confirming of a new government was put to the
                        Governor General which is supposed to be a pure formality, he refused to
                        accept the resignation of Mr. Hughes who thereupon went merrily on in his
                        office.</p>
                    <p>These things show how absurd it is to suppose there is a vestige of democracy
                        in the colonial system whether the colony be called crown colonies or
                        dominions. Of course all the rewards for service for a Prime Minister lie in
                        London. The people of his own community have nothing to offer him. Here
                        again we see the impossibility of imperialism's giving up the system of
                        granting titles in the branches, from which Canada at the present moment is
                        trying to escape. A recent instance of the direct control of the Prime
                        Minister from London is the sending of</p>

                    <p>Castlecrag stands a evidence of the joy of life attained. Here there can be
                        no such thing as a bad child. Here grouches are no longer grouches; they
                        can't resist and just join in. Here along with everything that is desirable
                        in a city one has every delight of the country, here with every rural
                        delight one is but a 15 minute motor ride to the center of a great
                        metropolis, here with beauty on every hand every modern convenience is
                        within touch, here life on earth is the heaven it should be everywhere -
                        here is Castlecrag.</p>

                        spectacularly beautiful with grand outlooks over Middle Harbor of Sydney;
                        but is on a main thoroughfare. So its destiny is to become a municipal

                        every block. The smaller bay on the North Shore will be a second Open Air

                    </p>
                    <p>To those interested in modern building design and construction the Catholic
                        College in the Melbourne University has, since work was begun upon it just a
                        year ago, been well worth watching. The structure has now reached a stage
                        where the Committee in charge are succeeding in their efforts to procure a
                        building thoroughly modern in construction, convenient and admirably adapted
                        to its use, and dignified and permanent in character, as befits any building
                        associated with a great institution of learning and the Church. They are
                        accomplishing these objects too at a minimum expenditure for the results
                        attained. Every detail of construction and appurtenance has been subject to
                        the closest scrutiny and nothing has been authorized which will not be
                        necessary to the most economical maintenance of the buildings, while as will
                        be seen every advantage has been taken of modern science to secure ease of
                        utility.</p>
                    <p>In general the plan consists of a central unit, the rotunda, in which are
                        situated all those activities which are common to the whole college as well
                        as its administrative offices, on each side roughly paralleling the
                        boundaries are the wings in which the students live, and as a terminal
                        feature to each wing is a building - that to the west adjoining the
                        University oval being utilized as a recreation center - that to the south
                        being the Education center.</p>
                    <p>On entering the Rotunda the visitor is accommodated in spacious reception
                        rooms to left and right, while directly in front of him is the great
                        Assembly Hall, a stately room whose ceilings, a reinforced concrete dome, is
                        carried on four main and eight subsidiary arches resting on eight heavy
                        reinforced concrete piers. This room is about 45 feet from the floor to the
                        top of the dome and with the gallery encircling it at the second floor level
                        and its projecting balconies forms a most attractive dining and general
                        assembly hall.</p>
                    <p>In the East and North wings of the building are accommodated the Rector's
                        office and suite. And the servants' Hall and Kitchens on the ground floor, a
                        spacious library, guest rooms, matrons' rooms,</p>

                        the basement provides well lighted and airy space for the Laundry,
                        Machinery, and boiler rooms, the latter accommodating the plants which
                        furnish hot water to heat each room in the entire structure as well as a hot
                        supply to every bath and basin. In addition space is also provided for ample
                        coal and other stores.</p>
                    <p>The South and West students' quarters each furnish accommodation for some
                        twenty eight students and are arranged to furnish the maximum accommodation
                        and privacy, each man having his own suite of study and bedroom. These
                        suites are arranged to furnish the maximum accommodation and privacy, each
                        man having his own suite of study and bedroom. These suites are arranged in
                        groups of eight, four on a floor, access being gained from halls and
                        staircases, which are entered from the Cloister. The latter runs the entire
                        length of the students' wings. On each floor one to every four rooms are
                        situated bath and toilet accommodation while in each bedroom are found built
                        in lavatory basins with hot and cold supplies and a large dust proof
                        wardrobe which are an integral part of the structure.</p>
                    <p>Following the Cloister of the South wing, a spacious arcaded walk with open
                        promenade above, which however the visitor must as yet build in his
                        imagination, the Education Building is reached. Here are located comfortable
                        studies and rest room for Extern women students, large lecture rooms,
                        laboratories for Chemistry and Biology students, and, until the much hoped
                        for Chapel materializes, an oratory.</p>

                        rooms, general recreation and reading room, and billiard room in addition to
                        its two main features, a commodious gymnasium and the great white tiled
                        plunge bath, 60 feet long and 24 feet wide, of ample size for indoor racing
                        meets, water polo, and other aquatic sports, the water of which will always
                        be kept at the proper temperature and of attractive appearance by the

                    <p>and filtration plants.</p>
                    <p>The construction of the building is as nearly fireproof as possible, all
                        ordinary precautions being taken to prevent fires, the main materials being
                        - Barrabool Hills stone, employed for its soft grateful color and splendid
                        quality for the exterior, backed up by walls of brick and concrete. The
                        ground floor is entirely of concrete, largely reinforced, and the second
                        floor of reinforced concrete carried on concrete beans and permasite tiles
                        making it practically sound proof. Interior bearing walls are of brick or
                        reinforced concrete and partition walls of permasite tile. The only timber
                        construction in the entire building is the roof of the students' quarter,
                        recreation and education buildings and even here it is only the framing as
                        the ceilings are of metal lath and plaster which is practically fireproof
                        and the covering is of tile. In the interior finish also wooden construction
                        is reduced to a minimum. The Cloister corridor floors as well as the stairs
                        are of tile, while all of the rooms have a coved base course and border of
                        magnesite surrounding the floor of Cork Carpet which has all the virtue of
                        linoleum added to which it is longer lived, is warmer and more grateful to
                        the feet. The windows and doors with frame of Jarrah, have plaster returns
                        so that the narrow jamb lining is the only wood trim used in the building,
                        the doors themselves being five ply solid flush veneer panels which are
                        practically fireproof as well as the most sanitary construction known. The
                        building will be screened throughout, every window and door as well as the
                        entire cloister being protected from those carriers of filth and disease,
                        the flies and mosquitoes. In fact throughout the entire structure the most
                        modern hospital practice has been adhered to in the details that make for
                        cleanliness and ease of maintenance.</p>
                    <p>The same spirit is to be observed in the design of the furniture, and the
                        landscape architecture of the grounds which have wisely been entrusted to
                        the architect to ensure a complete and harmonious whole. In the furniture
                        the same result has been attained as in the building itself, the ideals of
                        utility, permanence, simplicity, dignity and sanitation being constantly
                        before the designers. The type adopted</p>

                        cases, for head and foot boards of absence of cracks and crannies for the
                        harboring of dust or germs while at the same time it shows to the best
                        possible advantage the lovely grain of the wood used, compared to which all
                        man made decorations are futile mockeries. Genuine Spanish leather and the
                        best of hair <note>chair?</note> upholstery guarantee the longest life and
                        utmost comfort to those pieces which require such treatment.</p>
                    <p>The grounds on which the work has just commenced will be so planned as to
                        create the impression of a botanical garden, while at the same time the
                        maintenance charges will be light. This will be accomplished by a close
                        though informal hedge or shrubs, vines and trees which will surround the
                        place but by its irregular outline will suggest spaciousness rather than
                        confinement and will be composed of native Australian plants which once
                        started will to a large measure take care of themselves, growing naturally
                        more lovely and alluring. These plants will be arranged according to habit
                        of growth, color and time of blossoming so that there will always be some
                        section which is in attractive bloom, and the entire ground will present an
                        ever varying and newly attractive vista to the eye. Unattractive
                        surroundings will be screened or "planted out" and attractive ones enhanced,
                        and the whole set united and balanced by suitable lawns, drives and
                        pathways.</p>
                    <p>From the building as thus far constructed and from the plans of the committee
                        and their Architectural advisers it is apparent that though they are not
                        content with anything but the best procurable they are at the same time
                        getting full value for money spent.</p>

                            <note>"wood" has been crossed out</note> and stone, so that the force of
                        new ideas and independent thinking bids fair to outrival the great Gothic
                        upheaval of the Middle Ages - it is interesting to realize that here in
                        Australia, a young country whose architectural history has yet to be
                        written, the seeds of new and revolutionary ideas should be already sown and
                        flourishing.</p>
                    <p>For now that the lamp of revolution has been lit, and Australia is beginning
                        to catch a preliminary reflection from its beams, we are finding that a good
                        deal more has been happening in this direction than we would suppose, and
                        that there has been going on quietly amongst us the development of a new
                        scientific architecture ever since Walter Burley Griffin came to Australia
                        about sixteen years ago.</p>
                    <p>To the Australia public he needs no introduction. His prize-winning plans for
                        the lay-out of the Federal Capital served that purpose. The building of the
                        Capitol Theatre (Melbourne) and Newman College (Melbourne University) made
                        us a little better acquainted with him. Everyone is familiar with the
                        strange and arresting beauty of the Capitol Theatre. Newman College is not
                        generally known; it is doubtful indeed if Melbourne realizes what a precious
                        architectural possession it is. Though so absolutely different in type,
                        these buildings express the same art and the same scientific purpose. While
                        not classical in the conventional sense, Newman has an effect of pure and
                        gracious serenity. Its logical simplicity and freedom from architectural
                        platitudes impart to it a thoughtful and appropriate dignity. In its design
                        only the simplest forms have a logical explanation. As the architect says
                        himself, in his introduction to the plans, "art simply involves
                        co-ordinating all the elements of environment, site, functional forms,
                        facilities, material, texture and color, that can</p>

                    <p>NEWMAN COLLEGE, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY.</p>
                    <p>The architecture of Newman College, which is the work of Walter Burley
                        Griffin the Great, has been much criticized and is the subject of further
                        disparaging remarks in the latest issue of the University Students'
                        Magazine. One cultured gentleman has said that the building looks like a
                        factory, and another that it has the appearance of a barracks. It certainly
                        does differ from the stately Trinity, the inspiring Ormond and the severe
                        Queen's, but to my eyes it is not inferior to any of these, and when its
                        complete design is fulfilled will look better than the others. Its main
                        feature is that there are no long corridors, but two story groups of eight
                        flats, accommodating eight students, each opening off external cloisters.
                        There is no question that this arrangement makes the students concerned far
                        more comfortable than if the old plan were followed and that, after all, a
                        college is built to suit the comfort of the students.</p>

                        the presence of an attendance estimated at 30,000. The ceremony was
                        performed by the apostolic Delegate Archbishop Cattaneo. There was a large
                        and representative gathering of the clergy including Archbishop Mannix...</p>
                    <p>The work of collecting the funds for the building was commenced by Dr. Mannix
                        shortly after his arrival in Melbourne, the movement being given an impulse
                        by a donation of £30,000 for bursaries <note>student scholarships?</note>.
                        The foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Carr in June 1916 and the
                        building was opened free of debt.</p>

                    <p>Archbishop Cattaneo gave a brief address of a congratulatory nature and
                        stated that despite the war the problem of Roman Catholic education could
                        not be neglected. Bishop Phelan said that the life of Dr. Mannix was in
                        great danger. (Laughter) He was threatened with internment and
                        transportation. (Laughter) The danger, he said, was that Dr. Mannix would be
                        smothered with the affection of his people. (Cheers) The State police had
                        failed to rescue him from that danger and the Commonwealth police should be
                        tried. (Great laughter) The prime Minster (Mr. Hughes) should wish to
                        protect Dr. Mannix more than anyone else in the Commonwealth. (Great
                        laughter) (Note by M.M.G. This was in reference to the issue of conscription
                        against which the three chief influences in Australia had been Dr. Mannix,
                        little Adela Pankhurst in her teens and W.B.G. who was in close personal
                        touch with cabinet ministers, the issue however is different in a democracy
                        from what it is in a colony even one called a dominion.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. Mannix was received with enthusiastic cheering. He said that the college
                        was the dream and ambition of the late Archbishop Carr and it was a monument
                        to the magnificent work done by Dr. Carr during 31 years in Melbourne. Mr.
                        Donovan of Sydney had given the endowment for bursaries on condition that
                        the college was built at once and, in spite of the drought, the war and the
                        attacks on himself, the work had been completed (Cheers) It was necessary
                        that there should be a large endowment fund as it was his aim that the
                        brilliant sons of a poor man should have a full opportunity of a university
                        education. The building is of Barrabool Hills stone. It is equipped and
                        furnished in modern style. The college is taxed to its full accommodation,
                        there being 56 students. The acting rector is the Rev. J. O'Dwyer formerly
                        of St. Xavier's, Kew. The contractor was Mr. B. Moriarty.</p>
                    <p>When Griffin returned from Australia with his appointment as director in
                        hand, his first move was to scoot over to Europe to arrange for four judges
                        for a World competition for Parliament House - one English, one French
                            <note>Alfred-Pierre Agache?</note>, one Australian and one Finnish
                            <note>Eliel Saarinen?</note>. He</p>
                    <note>Saarinen and Agache had placed second and third, respectively, in the
                        Canberra design competition.</note>

                    <p>contacted three of those he had in mind personally. His intention was to have
                        one or more of the prize winners in the Capital competition given permanent
                        direction of building design and construction of buildings for the whole
                        city under himself as city planner, no building erected except as approved.
                        Within a few months the 1914 war broke out and was used by the officials to
                        defeat these plans. Unfortunately no such plan was ever effected.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the first year our little group was divided, <note>Roy</note>
                        Lippincott with his wife who was Griffin's sister <note>Genevieve</note>
                        remained to carry on the Sydney office while Elgh, who had helped us out
                        with the competition drawings in Chicago, and I went down to the Melbourne
                        private office. On the whole Griffin himself spent all his time day and
                        night on Capital affairs (though the arrangement was that half his time was
                        his own) over in his Federal office or with the Ministers, for the fight
                        with officialdom was raging.</p>
                    <p>However we did get hold of him for moments, usually late at night. One day he
                        came in with a sketch, on a usual small sized envelope, which he had made on
                        the train, for only so back and forth between Sydney and Melbourne could he
                        contact the Assistant Prime Minister who was in charge of the Federal
                        Capital. The train was a sort of Members club house. He had been given the
                        job of doing the Newman College of the Melbourne University. The whole thing
                        was there on that envelope plus what he had in his head. It was settled and
                        so it was built, but that was a war to the finish too for everything was
                        totally different from anything anybody had in mind. In the end there was
                        complete satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>These Colleges are dormitories plus some study facilities. The Catholics had
                        ten acres reserved for this purpose and Dr. Mannix was a power to lean on
                        and could grasp things beyond the customary. Things that have since become
                        customary in the finer buildings in the United States were introduced and no
                        authority could be pointed to to guarantee</p>

                    <p>them as being desirable such as flush doors, etc. But nothing could ever move
                        Griffin from the right answer. To him there was nothing but the right
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>The stone of the Barrabool Hills was not considered desirable as there was
                        much evidence of its not weathering satisfactorily. But its use would save a
                        big item in cost over the usual alternative of bringing the stone down from
                        Sydney and this would give Griffin a freer hand in designs so he visited the
                        towns around the Hills and found that where the stone had been laid properly
                        on its bed it had stood aging perfectly. The character of this stone was a
                        determining factor in the design - the flat receding arches leaving no
                        chance for wear by weather.</p>
                    <p>The building is as satisfying as those of Europe of the good old times but is
                        in no sense imitative, the whole determined by the nature of the stone and
                        the problems of its occupancy. Some of the opposition of the chief donor too
                        strong to be taken lightly was amusing. It was chiefly directed against the
                        modern plumbing for he considered the "thunder Mug" universal in his
                        experience (for up till some time later there was no sewer system in either
                        Sydney nor Melbourne) and that of his ancestors was quite sufficient and
                        that any expenditure in that line was not to be thought of. But Griffin's
                        arrangement, making a unit of four studies and bedrooms on each floor,
                        eliminated the necessity of even a house maid which the committee considered
                        so advantageous that the plumbing, that is the design of the building, was
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>The property is a long parallelogram on street corner. From being on level
                        with the street at one end it becomes a six foot high bank at the corner - a
                        grand chance for spectacular planting. The planting was here as always, like
                        Mayan Architecture of Ancient Mexico, a combination of classic dignity and
                        romantic riot of detail to which the incredible variety of evergreen shrubs
                        and trees native to Australia lent itself. Many of these have long
                        blossoming seasons - </p>

                    <p>the Peach-blossom Ti-tree and other like the Acacias, have many species which
                        make the round of the year with their blossoming seasons. Except where used
                        for special purposes his principle in planting was to leave no ground bare
                        anywhere in the accomplishment of which spiritual science lent its aid
                        through the knowledge of the four ethers and their control of form so that
                        when one ran across round leaved plants, controlled by the chemical ether,
                        ruled by the Moon, one would be safe in concluding that they were moisture
                        loving plants and would thrive in shaded places whereas sharp leaved ones
                        would be lovers of the sun, the ruler of the light ether. He planted whole
                        banks of terraces to the convolvulus mauritanious which took the place of a
                        lawn in our one-room house in Heidelberg <note>Melbourne suburb</note>,
                        spreading its sky-blue blossoms over the ground for nine months of the year
                        - a sight so entrancing that each morning as we left for the office we
                        walked backward to revel in its loveliness as long as possible. It saved the
                        trouble of mowing a lawn too.</p>
                    <p>The plan of the whole for the present and for some time to come was a Chapel
                        in the center set somewhat back from the street and free on all four sides.
                        On either side were two oblong buildings for special purposes, scientific
                        laboratories and lecture halls in one; swimming pool, gymnasium, etc. in the
                        other - the recreation building, each connected with the domed building's
                        one the great dining hall, the other the library building - by two stories
                        of dormitories and cloisters. These dormitories extend at right angles to
                        each other from the domed building and each terminates in one of the service
                        buildings, these again set at right angles - a truly magical conception.</p>
                    <p>When we look from the street toward the dome with its dainty lantern and
                        spires we see the two storied dormitories on the opposite side from the
                        cloisters and balconies above. On the opposite side of the dome from the
                        dormitories is in the one case the entrance and in the other, in duplicate
                        form, the kitchen quarters as shown in the photograph. There are no halls in
                        these buildings. The dormitories on the ground floor are reached from the
                        cloister and on the second story</p>
                    <pb n="243"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 243 ====]</p>
                    <p>from the balcony above. These entrances give on either side entrance to a
                        group of four suites of study and bedroom and to one bath and lavatory. The
                        same on both stories. The cloister sweeps around the dome at their internal
                        angle giving entrance to the dining hall and then on down past the other
                        dormitory arm to the recreation rooms in one case and to the laboratories in
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>The domed dining hall is a most beautiful room in color as well as in form
                        for the various surface patterns formed by this unique construction give
                        opportunity for various color patterns. I suppose strictly speaking this is
                        not a dome. The criss-crossing supporting arches cross so as to form a
                        central lantern at the top and determine the light illumination torches at
                        their bases. These indirect lighting fixtures were beyond the belief of the
                        building committee till the oculist among then found that he cold read the
                        finest print on his eye-testing card.</p>
                    <p>At the level of the second floor is the circle of balconies leading to the
                        various surrounding quarters. The whole gives marvelous opportunity for
                        great as well as small occasions and a happy and proud group are the
                        students and all who are centered here.</p>

                        <bibl>HOME BUILDING AS AN ART .<lb/> MAKING A MODEL SUBURB FOR SYDNEY. by
                            "Naphthali"</bibl>
                    </p>
                    <p>City life seems to be inevitable. Man is a gregarious animal and loves his
                        kind. But in this great land of open spaces gregariousness is overdone. One
                        would think there was a limit to Australian soil to judge from our
                        overcrowded and rather ugly cities, products of a tendency to follow in the
                        gouty footsteps of John Bull, and a lack of imagination and artistic
                        temperament which is truly British. When the climate and the open air life,
                        combined with aggressive propaganda by the free spirits of today, have freed
                        this budding Commonwealth from the grip of Mammon and the regime of the
                        Philistine, we will begin to build a new civilization. This, of course, will
                        call for new institutions. But first we must have new ideas. These are the
                        ground-plan of the new Commonwealth, in which life will be lived as a fine
                        art. Sounds Utopian, no doubt, to the matter of fact mind but sooner or
                        later all of us will be Utopians. Even Columbus, who set out in a boat
                        headed due west to seek the East Indies was utopian. But he arrived.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, is kind of Columbus in his
                        way. He has left the beaten track and launched out on the lonely waters,
                        hoping to reach the city of his dreams some fine day. To drop rather a mixed
                        metaphor, he has started to build a suburb by the shores of Sydney Harbor -
                        out of ideas. It is true he will use solid stone and a certain amount or
                        mortar and wood, and things material of that nature, but he depends for his
                        effects on ideas. He is a kind of a landscape architect - a painter of
                        effects, in stone, and lime, and elevations. A British painter of genius was
                        once asked how he mixed his paints. He replied – "With brains, Sir." Mr.
                        Griffin builds his model suburb with ideas. The stone and lime and other
                        matters are of the earth, earthy; but the ideas are Mr. Griffin's own. With
                        ideas he can demonstrate the triumph of mind over matter.</p>
                    <p>To achieve the broad effects he aims at, this landscape architect has a
                        canvas of 700 acres, situate on the foreshores of Middle Harbor, one or the
                        finest effects produced by that greatest of landscape artists, Dame Nature.
                        The combination which has resulted in the suburb of Castlecrag is a
                        combination of Nature and Art. The native flora is a thing of beauty, and
                        can be a joy forever. The aim of our builder of beautiful homes is to make
                        human habitations things of beauty, if not eternal joys; and it is certain</p>
                    <note>"Naphthali" - Naphtali (said to derive from a Hebrew term meaning "to
                        wrestle" or "to struggle") was a son of Jacob and a founder of one of the
                        Twelve Tribes of Israel. A similar essay will be found in Section III, No.
                        9, page 149ff.</note>

                    <p>that he has done something that stands out as unique in Australian history.</p>
                    <p>The dwellings in this new suburb are designed to harmonize with their natural
                        surroundings. The roads of easy grades sweep along the bluffs, and flow in
                        curves which please the eye. The houses are inconspicuous, in keeping with
                        the natural harmonies. As the natural flora is restored the houses will
                        nestle into place, so that the slopes, as they arise from the water's edge,
                        will be as completely garden as they were before being devastated by the
                        hand of the vandal.</p>
                    <p>The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre. When each allotment is
                        built upon, everyone will have a view of the stage and its setting, and in
                        every direction the eye will encounter a garden, instead of a brick wall or
                        an ugly fence. This effect is brought about also by the houses being placed
                        so that they do not occupy a set building line, but are so placed that they
                        conform to the general plan, which does away with all appearance of
                        crowding, and almost entirely conceals the houses by the trees, shrubs and
                        climbers.</p>
                    <p>The flat roofs add to this garden effect. By degrees the splendid blossoming
                        evergreen climbers, hardy in this climate, will cover or embower roofs as
                        well as walls.</p>
                    <p>Viewed as a town planning effort, Castlecrag not only accepts and makes the
                        most of natural surroundings, but meets all the needs of a human community.
                        The homes are planned for the greatest economy for the occupier and the
                        least inconvenience for the housekeeper, with the utmost in the way of aids
                        to home life for old and young.</p>
                    <p>Open spaces are reserved for all time, the interior parks giving safe play
                        space for the little ones still calling for care, yet allowing them the
                        intercourse with other children so useful for development. Park paths
                        connect these reserves, so that delightful walks will be possible even after
                        occupation is complete.</p>
                    <p>Foreshores to the extent of some four or five miles are being dedicated to
                        the public. Would that the community could regain those previously
                        subdivided and sold to the water's edge.</p>
                    <p>A natural acropolis, 300 feet above the water, on the central peninsula, is
                        the civic center; a sports field surrounded by public and semipublic
                        buildings entered from the business thoroughfare through a</p>
                    <pb n="248"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 248 ====]</p>
                    <p>semicircular colonnaded gateway. This center comprises such buildings as
                        churches, clubs, assembly halls, schools, libraries, hotels and theatres.</p>
                    <p>Two natural amphitheatres are located, the Cove theatre on the water
                        frontage, the Glen theatre at the head of a valley. One hundred acres have
                        been allocated to golf links, and a sheltered cove will be used as a
                        yachting club.</p>
                    <p>The citizens of Castlecrag are organized for various community purposes.
                        Committees for publicity, education, recreation, town-planning, and the like
                        have been set up, and steps are being taken for the erection of the
                        Castlecrag Community Clubhouse.</p>
                    <p>It is a great work, but it is only a beginning. It points to a new Australian
                        life, based on a new Australian idea. That idea is that it is absurd for
                        Australians to keep following in the gouty footsteps of old John Bull or to
                        ape Uncle Sam. They must think out a new civilization, and begin to draw up
                        the ground plan of the new institutions. The idea may be summed up in a
                        phrase; Life is a fine art. That is really what all the poets, the seers,
                        the revolutionaries of the ages have seen in their minds' eyes. It was the
                        vision that Moses beheld from the Mount ere he passed behind the veil. Life
                        as a fine art flourished on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in days long
                        fled; in lands where corn and wine abounded; where song and music and drama
                        made life resplendent; where man surpassed himself and became superman - all
                        this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the shores of the Pacific.
                        Castlecrag is a step toward the Australian ideal - a new Civilization, an
                        Australia white in soul.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Modern imperialism arising after the agricultural period of Feudalism is a
                        form of government which arose when the government formed a liaison with the
                        economic life of the mechanical period. It is called the machine age and it
                        does not meet the requirements of the 20th century. It was not an essential
                        unity and the mesalliance has become more and more apparent till now the
                        divorce of these two realms has become an urgent necessity. It expressed
                        itself in the carrying on of relations with conquered and colonial
                        communities and later in dealing with neighboring states. In its later
                        development the same methods are being applied to the citizenry within the
                        boundaries of the central unit and it is now generally designated as
                        totalitarianism>. The word communism no longer has any meaning. It is simply
                        perfected totalitarianism.<note>The last two sentences are
                        handwritten.</note></p>
                    <p>This last step lies in the Government's recognition of its natural advantage
                        over its partner, the business world, which it does everywhere now, and in
                        using its power first in bossing it then in taking business entirely into
                        its own hands. In doing this the community has the strength only of a beam,
                        properly the community should have the strength of a triangle. The
                        government is but one angle of this trinity and fails in its true function
                        which is to maintain Equity which requires that it safeguard the development
                        of individual ability. Failing this the evolution of humanity ends for the
                        aim of evolution is to bring into existence a being who can function in Free
                        Will.</p>
                    <p>It is a saddening spectacle to see great groups of able men sitting back and
                        complaining because someone is doing something they do not like. Why don't
                        they get busy and do something themselves. If they have placed power in
                        someone's hands and find it not pleasant let them not waste time in
                        expecting one not to use it. He is in fact under obligation to use the power

                        remedy such a difficulty by changing the personal. The new individual will
                        use the power the position has been found to supply. Watch any Parliamentary

                    <p>footsteps of its predecessor in increasing the power of the government.</p>
                    <p>Totalitarianism unites business and politics. The government controls the
                        economic affairs whereas its task is to watch over the economic affairs to
                        maintain equity comparable to the task of the traffic policeman. The
                        business men of America could so easily rectify that whole position if they
                        would quit asking the government for monopolies the granting of which simply
                        upsets the whole traffic system. With clean hands they could see to it that
                        the Government limited itself to maintaining equity.</p>
                    <p>So let our American people who really have a genius for organization quit
                        fussing and stewing about the political institution and set the world
                        another example as they did in the 18th century with a political organ to
                        maintain equity, established by our forefathers to maintain certain Soul
                        requirements. Let our generation take on the task of building up another
                        organization to take charge of the needs of the body, an Economic
                        Organization. Its requirements are essentially different from those of the
                        soul. We can't blame the political organ for taking this on if there is no
                        other organ in the community to fulfill this need. Nor have we any right to
                        complain if it makes a mess in its attempts. We ourselves are requiring an
                        impossible thing of it.</p>
                    <p>To build up this organ we in America need ask no favors of the politicians
                        nor bureaucracies. We need no change nor supplements to legislation, simply
                        some subtractions. We simply need, every man jack of us, to take part in
                        constructing this Economic Organ in such a way that our economic life can be
                        healthy and in a position to alter and grow and readjust itself to the
                        changes which necessarily arise in a living, evolving thing — humanity. Now
                        that the American bureaucracy has been to so great an extent reinstated,
                        which has taken a hundred years to a day almost since our great President
                            <note>Andrew</note> Jackson destroyed its power, it will not take long
                        for it to feel its power and use it.</p>

                    <p>said:- "A good idea of the progress of Argentina can be obtained from the
                        census figures. In 1895 the population of Argentina was 3,954,911; that of
                        Australia was 3,491,621. In 1914 the number of people living in Argentina
                        had just about doubled and was 7,885,237. In that year Australia's
                        population was only 4,940,952. That is to say, 25 years ago there were only
                        half a million fewer people in Australia than in Argentina, but seven years
                        ago Argentina had swung almost 3,000,000 ahead and today the population of
                        this progressive South American State is probably twice that of the
                        commonwealth. Not only so, but it is certain to receive vastly more
                        emigrants than we .....Their arrival will inevitably give a tremendous
                        impetus to production, commerce and manufacture." The cause of this
                        difference lies largely in the greater perfection of the Civil Service in
                        Australia which prevents the development of individual initiative and of
                        course has none itself as that is a human and not a state faculty.</p>
                    <p>For an American to comprehend the significance of certain things it is
                        necessary for him to know that so long as a bureaucracy exists at all it has
                        the character of immortality. A permanent officialdom never dies. It acts as
                        a unit and any temporary loss it proceeds to make up for. It does not need
                        to accomplish its results in a life time nor in a generation nor during a
                        particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group during a
                        particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group of individuals
                        who have been stung into activity, nor in a decade nor in a century. The
                        episode of the revolt in the 18th century of the Americans has no look of
                        permanence to the bureaucracy from which it broke away, and bit by bit they
                        prepare the way to remove the influence threatening their organization. This
                        alone is sufficient to bring about a war of Britain or as it now stands a
                        United Europe (Russia is Asiatic) against America, its (bureaucracy's)
                        natural enemy.</p>

                    <p>A couple of absurd incidents really do exhibit this attitude of a government
                        based on a thoroughly entrenched Civil Service, and military too of course.
                        En route to our destination - Australia - we spent a day in Roturua, New
                        Zealand. Among the many interesting experiences there, among the Maoris, was
                        one which included a divorce case in which the whole day was occupied in the
                        conference of the two tribes concerned, with accusations, placations and
                        final adjustment and the conciliation feast. In the evening we went to the
                        theatre for the Maori dancing and singing and were intensely amused with
                        what we later took much more seriously. Over the Proscenium arch was a
                        picture of George, Rex, <note>George V</note> and below a painting of four
                        flags one of them the flag of the United States. (This in 1914.)</p>
                    <p>The second amusing incident was in Melbourne shortly after the outbreak of
                        the war when I went, as required, to the police station to register as an
                        alien. A big husky officer sat at his desk with a huge volume in front of
                        him. I told him what I had come for and to his question as to my
                        nationality, said I was an American. "Oh," he said, pushing the book aside,
                        "Then you are not an alien." "But I am." I said, "If I don't register I'm
                        likely to get into trouble." "But I mean," said he, "What country do you
                        belong to?" "I belong to the United States of America," I said. "Well then
                        you are not an alien," he said settling back in his chair. "But yes, I am an
                        alien," I said. "What country do you belong to: like Italy or France or
                        Germany," he said. "Yes," I said. "The country I belong to is not Italy nor
                        France nor Germany, but the United States of America." "Then you're not an
                        alien," he said. "Yes," I said, "It's this way. The Canadians are Americans
                        too but they still belong to the British Empire so they are not aliens but
                        the United States of America does not belong to the British Empire so they
                        are aliens." And wide eyed and full of astonishment he said, "Ohhhhhhh!" and
                        permitted me to sign the book.</p>
                    <p>An American who lives in a colony, Australia for instance, finds that he has
                        dropped back into the colonial times of his own country</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 254 ====]</p>
                    <p>and gets a totally different perspective on the events that have been
                        transpiring before his eyes in his own country. He sees the menace of the
                        gradual development of the Civil Service System, Civil Service Reform, for
                        which he had been working enthusiastically and which has so nearly reached
                        perfection in the United States that it is becoming safe for the Imperial
                        bureaucracy to take the next step.</p>
                    <p>There has been continuous propaganda carried on in the United States in
                        educational quarters. In the universities it is quite common for professors
                        to advocate the Parliamentary system as versus the Congressional; for
                        students to be impressed with the idea that the British political system,
                        though nominally monarchical, is in reality more democratic more directly
                        sensitive to the people, than the American. Nothing could be farther from
                        the truth. The British is an almost inconceivably perfect bureaucratic
                        system and the Parliamentary form of government is a perfect tool for it,
                        and the politicians are powerless to do anything contrary to the wish of
                        officialdom, even Winston Churchill as instanced in the <note>Sir
                        Stafford</note> Cripps—Indian event, such a clever camouflage with which to
                        deceive the public into thinking it has power and control. But when a civil
                        servant comes to Mr. Churchill and says, "But Mr. Churchill that can't be
                        done." Mr. Churchill sends the cable to India, knowing that he will promptly
                        be thrown out of office if he doesn't. All the major European governments
                        are Fascist Governments. There is no way by which the people can alter that
                        since there is no definite period of office and the initiation of an
                        election does not lie in the hands of the people, nor in a constitutional
                        right. There have been attempts to throw America back into the parliamentary
                        form but as yet the constitution stands - a unique thing in the world, in
                        consequence of which America with 6 per cent of the population of the world
                        consumes 50 per cent of the products of the world.</p>
                    <p>A name is a wonderful screen to hide behind. It is most insidious propaganda
                        to speak of European Empires as democracies and leads to a complete
                        misunderstanding of the facts.</p>
                    <pb n="255"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 255 ====]</p>
                    <p>Thus it is as much to the interest of the British Empire to influence the
                        United States to exclude certain immigrants and to hamper certain trade as
                        it is to force Australia to strangle herself by similar procedure. If we
                        come down to ultimates it is probably a fact that the real reason why the
                        United States has 130,000,000 inhabitants and enormous wealth and Australia
                        only 8,000,000, or only one cityful, and almost no wealth is the
                        independence of the one and the dependence of the other, for the "Mother"
                        country is a leech on the dependent communities and you find the wealth of
                        Australia continuously being dumped into the coffers of London.</p>
                    <p>Again Stead (an Englishman) says:- "Australia found to her cost that when
                        urgent need for wheat arose, Great Britain and France preferred to send
                        ships to Argentina to get it because the journey was so much shorter. For a
                        time it is true Argentine wheat was not shipped to Europe as the Argentines
                        demanded gold and England was not able to send it. Sometime, perhaps, the
                        story of how the needed gold was found and where it came from will be told —
                        it is an interesting episode, and illustrates how excellently the censor was
                        able to assist a government in deceiving its people."</p>
                    <p>We were there. Gold was common currency, was in everyone's pockets. Suddenly
                        nobody was carrying gold, only paper. The gold had all been sent to England
                        to buy Argentine wheat, etc. Result, in Australia there is a technically
                        named "depression," which lasted for years.</p>
                    <p>This was a characteristic use of a colony (and a dominion is no more than
                        that), adopting the policy of forcing her to limit her enterprise to primary
                        products, then when convenient refuses her shipping to carry wheat and trick
                        her through the banks (London controlled) into supplying the gold to buy the
                        wheat of her greatest rival. The Boer War had similarly been financed by
                        stripping Australia of the gold of her early discoveries, free loans to
                        everybody — on short terms — then suddenly foreclosing. The gold had gone to
                        England.</p>
                    <pb n="256"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 256 ====]</p>
                    <p>So driving the gold out of circulation and into London during the 1st World
                        War was not the first time Australia had her gold spirited away to fill the
                        coffers of the magnates of London. Before the Boer War the system followed
                        was to start a land boom, to assist the Australian banks in financing
                        speculators and then pulling the strings, calling in all short term loans,
                        taking all the gold to finance the war and leaving Australia flat as a
                        pancake for a long period of poverty and depression. It also set the
                        population back to primary production. Never would it do to let a colony
                        become sufficiently self-sufficient to feel that it could go alone. The
                        whole system of education is based on training fear and hatred into the
                        souls of the young which forms a chain which few are able to throw off in
                        later years.</p>
                    <p>A member of Parliament who later became Prime Minister was one of those who
                        at the outbreak of the war openly rejoiced that the Germans had been fools
                        enough to go to war (the 1st World War). At that time he doubtless did not
                        know that the initiative had been taken by Russia, assured of the backing of
                        England given it directly by the bureaucracy, i.e., the king, by the Navy,
                        since as Brailsford <note>Henry Noel Brailsford?</note>, an Englishman,
                        says:- that assurance (i.e., that if Russia would mobilize England would
                        back her in the war which would be sure to follow. That mobilization was
                        ordered not by the Czar but by the bureaucracy. The answer was war.) was not
                        given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs nor by the Cabinet nor by
                        Parliament but he assures us it was given. This means of course that England
                        started the war. This member doubtless accepted the idea put over by the
                        manufacturers of news that Germany had started the war. He rejoiced, said
                        they were fools, that if they had kept on with their peaceful methods they
                        would before long have had the trade of the world in their hands but now
                        England could destroy her as a trade rival. That is the European system. It
                        is called Maintaining the Balance of Power. These things were known to the
                        Germans then and should be remembered in judging the Germans now in 1945.

                        was a member of the Labor Party we note his imperialistic view which indeed
                        is quite as characteristic of the Laborites as of the conservatives - the
                        Liberal Party. Here was naturally good material for the use of London.
                        Shortly after this Hughes became Prime Minister (Not by an election by the
                        people). <note>Andrew</note> Fisher was sent to England as High
                        Commissioner. The same thing happened in the 2nd War when <note>John</note>
                        Curtin was called to England. <note>This last sentence is handwritten and
                            has been inserted into the typescript.</note> Soon Hughes went to London
                        and from that time on was supposed to be barracking <note>i.e.,
                        cheering</note> for Australia noisily and even boldly opposing the policies
                        of the "Mother Country" contrary to the fact again. He was throughout merely
                        a smoke screen for Imperial purposes. His loud talk about never trading with
                        Germany served after the war to keep Australia from buying in that market
                        when all the rest of the world, Britain included, was quite ready and most
                        eager to buy and sell. This is entirely contrary to the interests of
                        Australia but according to the interests of Britain since it helps to limit
                        both sales and purchases of Australians to Britain which is made more secure
                        by the recent raising of the tariff to a point almost prohibitive of foreign
                        imports.</p>
                    <p>Hughes undertook to put over conscription and failed because he had not yet
                        realized that the way to do things was to be utterly high handed and he did
                        not realize the strength of certain elements he was up against. One was
                        little Adela Pankhurst, and one was Archbishop Mannix. In this connection it
                        is necessary to remember that conscription in Australia as also in Ireland
                        is a totally different issue from what it is in the United States. The
                        interest of the Mother country is like that of a conqueror, by no means the
                        interest of the dominion, frequently quite the opposite. An instance of this
                        was the ghastly Gallipoli affair where Australian boys were deliberately
                        thrown to the cannon to make a show of conflict where there was no desire
                        nor intention to win, where in fact there was an understanding</p>

                    <p>between England and Russia that neither would conquer Constantinople. Each
                        wanted this for itself but left that point to be settled after Germany had
                        been disposed of. In fact the Australians were not allowed to win. A
                        horrible piece of butchery. Another instance was Singapore in the 2nd World
                        War. <note>This last sentence is handwritten and has been inserted into the

                        CITRUS ORCHARD DISTRICT</p>
                    <p>Idalia, Lee County, Florida lies on sandy palmetto flats and pine hammocks
                        about 5 feet above the high water level of the Caloosahatchee River and with
                        a maximum average variation in elevation represented by that figure. In its
                        layout the problem was to match in salable lots the showing of the
                        preordained conventional treatment. Such amenities as public fronts on the
                        river front and esplanades were permissible only when obtained without
                        encroachment on that assumed maximum of salable space. The site being
                        naturally flat the roads are therefore direct necessarily. The one crossing
                        from east to west is the diverted course of a through roadway. The north and
                        south ways open up the best views of the river's expanse where the water
                        vista is greatest and give access to the water and public park space for the
                        people at the most desirable points. The lagoon terminating the west street
                        is natural. The main esplanade commands the longest sweep of the river.</p>
                    <p>Since at present transportation is mainly from the gulf port of Fort Myer
                            <note>Fort Myers?</note>, 18 miles by water, the dock is the main
                        station for both freight and passengers. It is placed, however, where its
                        clutter will not interfere with the prospect or dignity of the water front.
                        The main esplanade as an approach leads where the maximum of passenger
                        traffic will not cross the freight handling space which is directly
                        connected by alley shipping ways to the rears of all the mercantile and
                        industrial sites. The electric railroad station eventually will co-ordinate
                        with the water station in its position at the other end of the esplanade and
                        in common with the water gate offers the advantage of comprehensive and most
                        attractive aspect of this little community to the new arrival. Facing the
                        esplanade also will be public buildings and hotel as well as stores and
                        shops and the generous allowance for a setting of tropical verdure and
                        flower gardens may well permit this village to utilize the advantages of its
                        southern situation.</p>

                    <p>THE KING</p>
                    <p>The usual assumption in America is that in Britain the King is but a symbol
                        or but a social functionary without real political power. This is no more
                        true of him than of the king of any other country or any time. Always and
                        anywhere a king is more or less powerful according to his personality and
                        almost never has a king much power as an official. But the office of king is
                        all powerful in Britain as elsewhere since it is the stronghold of
                        bureaucracy. The offices of the Kingdom may be held sometimes by one group,
                        sometimes by another but always the organization, with the King as the
                        keystone, is the all powerful political and therefore economic and social
                        element in our totalitarian communities and they are all totalitarian since
                        they all have but one community organization. With a king one can give
                        titles, the cheapest way of bribing. <note>This last sentence is handwritten
                            and has been inserted into the typescript.</note> The bureaucracy is the
                        master and the others the slaves however manifested. This is but the logical
                        consequence of the system and is inescapable though some are more firmly
                        established than others.</p>
                    <p>Of all screens behind which the Bureaucracy hides itself the most effective
                        is the Parliamentary form of government. Let us analyze the executive office
                        in the parliamentary system. During the 1st World War who chose the Prime
                        Minister of Australia? Who chose the Prime Minister of England? Not the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Through the exposure of Russian official documents and even before that we
                        have evidence that the 1st World War was started by the Bureaucracies. The
                        final plunge was taken by the Russian Bureaucracy on the assurance of the
                        support of the British (see Brailsford <note>Henry Noel Brailsford?</note>).
                        The Kaiser sent a messenger to the Czar imploring him not to mobilize. The
                        Czar so instructed the head of his army who reported this forthwith to the
                        British King's emissary, the head of the British navy who spoke with
                        authority. He said, "Mobilize anyway and the British Navy will stand back of
                        you." The Russian army was mobilized which according to the treaties meant
                        war was declared by the Allies, by Britain. <note>Herbert Henry</note>

                    <p>was Prime Minister at the time in England. He was anti-war. But mysteriously,
                        by no act of the people, <note>David</note> Lloyd George became Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>We have seen how even in ordinary times the people have nothing to say in the
                        choice of the national executive in a Parliamentary system. They usually
                        have some idea of who it will be to start with, for the man who is leader of
                        the party (which is not decided by the people) at the time of election as
                        member of Parliament is usually, at least temporarily, made Prime Minister.
                        He is made leader of the party not by the people but by the parliamentary
                        members of his party. Really when anything important is on the Prime
                        Minister is nominated by the King, i.e., the Bureaucracy. The day after the
                        election another member than the leader can be substituted and made the
                        Prime Minister in the name of the King. Coercion is effected by the mild
                        phrase – "It is the King's pleasure" but if one doesn't conform one is a
                        traitor.</p>
                    <p>How was it that Ramsay MacDonald with his party at last a majority agreed to
                        a coalition party to transform the monetary system of Britain? Was it the
                        King's pleasure?</p>
                    <p>The case of <note>William Morris</note> Hughes is one such for shortly after
                        election, <note>Andrew</note> Fisher, the Prime Minister, was sent to
                        England as Commissioner and Hughes was chosen by the members. (This is the
                        method of the Labor Party in Australia.) The people had nothing to say about
                        this. If the step can't be brought about within the party then it is brought
                        about as we recently saw in France with Monsieur <note>Edouard</note>
                        Daladier. Or when the party members think the Ministers have been drawing
                        the larger salary long enough they put them out and others in.</p>
                    <p>Asquith remained Prime Minister for a while after the outbreak of the war and
                        then what happened? Lloyd George became Prime Minister. It was not Asquith's
                        wish nor the choice of the Liberal Party which had been elected by the
                        people. His cabinet was made up largely of the opposing party, so if it was
                        by common consent of the two parties this but removes it one step further
                        from the expressed wish of the people.</p>
                    <pb n="262"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 262 ====]</p>
                    <p>Gradually practically the whole of the government unit with Lloyd George was
                        made up of the Tory Party, so that we have the direct opposite of the will
                        of the people as expressed in the election. Lloyd George and a Tory cabinet
                        suited someone or some power for war purposes and the reins were put in
                        their hands. The power - the Bureaucracy, was satisfied so the arrangement
                        continued. The essence of the bureaucratic system under the parliamentary
                        screen is secrecy. The officials claim no glory. They get their rewards from
                        within.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes visited London and served
                        them there by voicing the "Destroy German Trade" and the economic boycott
                        idea, perhaps the chief cause of the present war. He enabled London to seem
                        mild and open minded at the Paris Conference and very democratic in the "We
                        must grant our dominions some say in Imperial questions." He had returned
                        from his first visit with instructions to put over conscription in
                        Australia. He overestimated his powers of persuasion and so made a fatal
                        error in his first step. This error saved Australia from conscription. We
                        pause to say that conscription in an empire is a totally different thing
                        from in a democracy where Equity is the foundation stone of the Political
                        Organ.</p>
                    <p>Instead of himself announcing conscription and setting the bureaucratic
                        machinery rolling as he could have done, he preferred to get the decision of
                        the Cabinet as authority to act on. He failed to get that by the barest
                        thread, one vote which was held, by one of those curious chances, to the
                        cause of the people (in this case it was the personal influence of Griffin
                        with a minister with whom he was lodging) for just long enough to prevent
                        conscription from becoming an executive measure, the man having this casting
                        vote going over shortly after entirely to the Tory side when a coalition
                        party was formed. Hughes then took the matter to Parliament which refused to
                        authorize conscription but voted that it be referred to the people. So an
                        election was called for votes from former constituents (knowing he could get
                        the Tory vote)</p>

                    <p>by giving out that he would not establish conscription without referring it
                        to the people. He was made by Dr. Mannix of the Catholic Church to make a
                        definite promise to this effect.</p>
                    <p>Now for a few months he was Prime Minister as the choice of the people so far
                        as it can be expressed in the Parliamentary system. This election encouraged
                        him to believe that the majority was with him and he put the conscription
                        issue to the people and in electioneering said it was an absolutely
                        necessary policy which the government must have, that he would refuse to be
                        responsible for the government of Australia without conscription, and he
                        made a definite promise that he would look upon this as a vote of confidence
                        of the people direct and would resign if the vote failed to carry. It failed
                        and the weeks and months passed but no resignation was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The majority of the people were looking for and demanding his resignation and
                        though their feelings were not those with which the press concerned
                        themselves yet, after all, the Australian Tories did not care for Hughes.
                        There were the old issues on which they had fought and condemned him when he
                        was a Labor Member. They would rather have one of their own men as leader of
                        the Party so some of this demand for resignation crept into the press. He
                        finally, no doubt after consultation with the inner circles, the holy of
                        holies, gave his resignation to the Governor General <note>Ronald
                            Munro-Ferguson</note> doubtless knowing in advance what would happen.
                        The Governor General is the direct agent of the London Bureaucracy, in other
                        words of the Crown, so in a final emergency can act and did so here (Just as
                        it is in India really). Hughes was a proved trusty of the Imperial
                        Interests. His resignation was not accepted by the Governor General, of
                        course on the parliamentary basis that he saw no other way of establishing a
                        stable Government with the parties as they stood in Parliament (though the
                        leader of the opposition party went to the governor with the statement that
                        he was convinced that the Labor Party could carry on - in other words could
                        hold a majority of members in</p>
                    <note>"Trusty" can mean a trusted individual as well as a convict deemed
                        trustworthy enough to be granted special privileges.</note>

                    <p>votes put to the house. So Hughes from that time on remained Prime Minister
                        in spite of a majority against him in the community. He was satisfactory to
                        imperial interests and that ended it. Having technically kept his promise
                        Hughes continued to hold his job as Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>We get at this time another glimpse of the method of operation of the
                        Parliamentary system for there was a considerable number of members of his
                        own party who were much dissatisfied with the things Hughes was doing and
                        the way he was doing them, and they were ready and eager to break away and
                        join the Labor members to form a new government but Hughes's threat that he
                        would dissolve Parliament was sufficient to keep them from taking the step
                        since dissolution means a new election which means for every member
                        strenuous electioneering work and risk of losing his seat. This was also
                        coupled with another enlightening element of the system. There was a real
                        danger in the break away if they could get John Forrest, an old and popular
                        politician, to head the Labor Party, so the Imperial forces took the
                        precaution of giving John Forrest the title of Lord (limited to his lifetime
                        to be sure), never before given to an Australian. This satisfied the old
                        man's ambition and he no longer menaced Hughes. Having a King gives this
                        almost irresistible power to the Bureaucracy. The cheapest form of bribery.
                        Tagore learned this and handed back his title saying he had not understood
                        its significance when he accepted it.</p>
                    <p>This is not democratic government. It is Bureaucratic government pure and
                        simple but not an open and honest Bureaucratic government such as the
                        Russian. In fact at present there are no governments anywhere that are not
                        bureaucratic. It cannot be otherwise with totalitarian governments (i.e.,
                        one organ for three functions - i.e., liberty, equity, fraternity) and there
                        is no other form of government at present. It is time there was. With the
                        present system, having a King makes bribery the simplest and cheapest thing
                        in the world. The possibility even, of a title, is sufficient to keep most
                        in line. Hughes never got his. <note>This last sentence is

                        awarded a knighthood in 1915. He repudiated it in 1919 in protest to the
                        Massacre of Amritsar when British troops had fired on a crowd of unarmed

                        otherwise in so unwholesome an arrangement. One method that can be used was
                        explained to us by a member of Parliament. With the secret ballot and the
                        printing in the hands of the <hi rend="ul">bureaucrats</hi> one ballot form
                        is enough to buy and secure a whole line of votes. The one ballot paper is
                        made out as desired, given to a voter, he gets his blank form at the voting
                        place and brings out the blank form after having deposited the form given to
                        him and brings it back to the boss, which checks his having voted as desired
                        or not at all and the chain goes on. Naturally all the advantages in this
                        game would be on the side of the officials as the forms are printed in
                        Government offices. You see the King is a power in exactly the same sense
                        that Parliament is a power. Both are perfect instruments for Bureaucracy. In
                        America one flaw is the two thirds requirement in the Senate which caused
                        the catastrophe of <note>President Woodrow</note> Wilson's so called failure
                        in Paris. <note>Georges</note> Clemenceau and <note>David</note> Lloyd
                        George knew that Wilson had no "power" so they utterly ignored him after
                        they had attained secrecy of sessions.</p>
                    <p>As <note>Antonio de Oliveira</note> Salazar of Portugal said in 1923 –
                        "Politics must bring economics into line with moral interests." That is its
                        one function - to maintain Equity. There is at present a hopeful sign in the
                        World Organization which speaks not only of Security (Equity) but also of an
                        Economic Organ and a Social Organ (Abilities) It is our job - America's job
                        - to see to it that it works out that way.</p>
                    <p>Russia is the least to be feared of all European governments since it is an
                        honest and open Bureaucratic government. There is a strong possibility
                        through the changes going on in Russia that it will be the first to build up
                        an Economic Organization and to add a Political Organ limited to maintaining
                        Equity. America's task is to facilitate this trend in Russia and to join
                        with her in making it a World Economic Organization and to clean our own
                        house by limiting our government to maintaining Equity.</p>

                    <p>Railroads in Australia</p>
                    <p>The Canberra plan had been gazetted which means no change can be made in it
                        without an Act of Parliament, and the dragon eyed Mr. <note>James
                        Alexander</note> Smith got questions asked in Parliament as to who had been
                        authorized to change levels established by the designer.</p>
                    <p>And now the matter of Railroads should be brought before the public. As you
                        travel over the mountains going from Sydney to Melbourne you look down below
                        to the old wagon road making the crossing at a much better grade.
                        Governments quite deliberately always choose the wrong way first. People
                        gradually realize that another way is better so it becomes easy to scrap the
                        old and do another way, thus maintaining their force, still not choosing the
                        right way if it can be avoided as in the Railway to Canberra where Griffin,
                        learning that a change was contemplated, laid out a route with a comfortable
                        gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old road thus keeping
                        the way open for another tear down and rebuild.</p>
                    <p>Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the railroads in the
                        control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America
                        shows the consequences for individual initiative has brought about
                        continental development in the United States. The railroads have been
                        undertaken and pushed far and wide ahead of and encouraging settlement and
                        development. The government control in Australia has made that impossible
                        from the beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escape from a
                        system firmly established where the preponderating vote of the city
                        population makes it always to the advantage of the population to cater to
                        the apparent advantage of urban interests rather than the advantage of the
                        whole and the need of the future.</p>
                    <p>So on the whole, the railroads are simply links connecting the established
                        cities which continually frustrates any hopes or plans of increasing the
                        population of the rural districts. The problem of decentralization will
                        probably never be solved until the radical step has been taken of breaking
                        the liaison between political <note>"and economic" inserted in the N-YHS

                    <p>the establishment of an Economic Organ. This is the more difficult perhaps
                        because in Australia the Labor party is by no means a Labor party but an
                        industrial organization whose interests are with the manufacturing element
                        as versus the primary producers. Professor Meyers <note>Hugo Richard
                        Meyer?</note>, a student of railroading, has shown that the history of the
                        railroads is the history of Australia. From the other angle, Mr. Valentine,
                        an official of the Railroad Department but one of those whose mentality had
                        not been perverted through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally
                        owned and privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a
                        definite time required 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the
                        government owned railroad it took 247. Our own experience would lead us to
                        take this as a typical example in the expense to the community of the
                        Government owned utilities. <note>written by?</note>Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>An electrician in chinning <note>i.e., talking, chatting</note> with Griffin
                        on their personal experiences told the following tale:- As sometimes
                        happens, though rarely, and only as a Temporary Official, he had been called
                        to take charge of the undergrounding of the wires of the center district of
                        Sydney. As the work approached completion he called the attention of his
                        superior officer to the necessity of placing the men in some other work as
                        of course it is practically impossible to dismiss Civil Servants. The chief,
                        not wanting to bother, told him to find something for them to do. He replied
                        that he couldn't and got the answer, "Well, then tear out the work and do it
                        over again."</p>
                    <p>Of course in Australia there is always the added pressure from England's
                        wanting to lend money and never wanting the principal to be repaid. In the
                        tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable, miserable things
                        imaginable. In Melbourne they ran the buses off by increasing the taxation.
                        In Sydney the case is worse yet for with constant and often very steep
                        slopes the grinding noise of the cable trams is unendurable and the old
                        board seats intolerable.</p>
                    <p>The buses came in, on the whole simply supplementing the trams</p>
                    <pb n="265d"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 265d ====]</p>
                    <p>in districts where trams were often more than a mile away. For why should a
                        bureaucracy bother to meet the needs of a community? Much better to hold
                        back as much of the income as possible for munition makers and other pals
                        who will help to pull off a war any time the Imperial Center wants one as it
                        does every time an economic rival appears on the horizon, the present rival
                        of course being the United States.</p>
                    <p>The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to curbs for
                        passengers). When the tramway department began the fight against them they
                        offered to buy the tramways and pay off the whole indebtedness in 15 years
                        (and they could easily have done so) but no, the government bit by bit
                        increased the tax till they could no longer meet the expense and had to
                        quit. In some cases the tram fares were then increased and the years roll on
                        with no decrease in their very heavy rates. In the course of time however
                        with increasing popular demands for buses they put on a few but first,
                        seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old tram cars with
                        new heavily built ones, still uncomfortable and noisy and dangerous, so that
                        they could spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable
                        transportation for hilly Sydney — the buses.</p>
                    <p>Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and
                        urgently required service helps maintain the "morale," helps to keep the
                        people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in
                        the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in
                        Australia, but it keeps the people busy and feeling important. I thought a
                        pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the
                        women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part of
                        their efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in
                        something they had at heart, which seemed shocking business to me who had
                        been accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for any
                        sort of charity or for assistance in any personal undertakings.</p>

                    <p>This hillside opens out to charming views of Mount Chocorua and the
                        surrounding ranges. The hill slopes from a level of 800 to 1100 feet above
                        sea level.</p>
                    <p>The streets follow the natural contours so will be nearly level roads with a

                        interior reserves facilitate attaining this end. And yet the whole has a
                        formality which makes it comprehensible and gives it distinction.</p>
                    <p>The Fellowship will retain ownership of its organization center on the North
                        extremity of the Estate.</p>
                    <p>The three roads coming into the thoroughfare, Route 16, will naturally
                        establish a business center at this halfway location between two established
                        towns. The estate should retain ownership of this business area renting it
                        at land values rate to business occupants thus facilitating its growth.</p>
                    <p>The interior park of the Community Social Center, midway on the slopes, is so
                        lovely and so interesting that especial pains should be taken to reserve it
                        in its natural state to inspire all the children of the community through
                        the coming generations. The allotments surrounding it are of sufficient area
                        for the educational and other social buildings and for the</p>

                        line. In this park is the lovely haunted pool and the precipitous bluff to
                        the East of it. Of course the idea is to keep the whole property as natural
                        as possible. It should be a magnet for nature lovers.</p>
                    <p>This circuit is removed from all the speedways thus safe for the children,
                        and when evening comes it will be much pleasanter for the elders who in the
                        morning have to use the highway. So here are located all the cultural
                        activities, schools, libraries, churches, club houses, little theatres,
                        music halls, bowling alleys, etc.</p>

                    <p>For Mrs. Lola Lloyd – Winnetka, Illinois<lb/> Marion M. Griffin – Architect,
                        Landscape Architect</p>
                    <p>The planning of a district requires the investigation of its surroundings.
                        The location of streets must be established so that proper connections will
                        be made not only with the present road systems but with such roads as can be
                        most advantageously laid out in the future in the adjacent properties, for
                        circulation with easy grades and for occupation. Therefore the location of
                        the future streets on adjoining properties has been suggested. In every case
                        they follow the natural contours so will be nearly level roads with minimum
                        grading.</p>
                    <p>On the hill side the roads wind around following the contours so that the
                        climb even to the top offers no steep grades, cheapening the construction
                        and making motor access easy and safe. The interior reserves facilitate
                        attaining this end. And yet the whole has a formality which makes it
                        comprehensible and gives it distinction. The road system is not dependent on
                        any of the roads suggested in adjoining estates but in the end
                        intercommunication will be desirable for both parties. It would probably be
                        years before the residential district is completed. That is of no importance
                        so long as each thing is done correctly.</p>
                    <p>The district between Old Road and Route 16 has been suggested on correct Town
                        Planning principles for a flat region between two radial thoroughfares, the
                        distributive residential roads coming in at right angles to the
                        thoroughfares so that there will be no acute lots. This is important for
                        both economy and appearance. A portion of the Route 16 frontage belongs to
                        the National Forest Reserve whose chief extent is on the other side of the
                        road. It contains the head of a valley and is ideal for the location of an
                        open air theatre</p>
                    <note>Lola Maverick Lloyd (1875-1944) was a noted peace activist, suffragist and
                        advocate for world government.</note>
                    <pb n="270"/>

                    <p>permission for which could doubtless be obtained as the community grows. It
                        would of course undertake not to injure the natural loveliness of the
                        reservation. The proximity of this reserve and its trails to the top of
                        Mount Chocorua again make this location a natural center for development.</p>
                    <p>For many years it would probably not be desirable to develop the property to
                        the N.W. of Old Road (to the south of the Lodge) any more intensely than
                        shown. If a time comes when the district takes on a more urban character the
                        transverse polygonal roads starting from Route 16 could be extended across
                        the circular arc, diverting on an angle in the center to come in
                        perpendicular to Old Road. The depth of the allotments could then be reduced
                        to the normal 200' to make a sufficient interior park. The price to be paid
                        for such repurchase at price originally paid per acre should be written into
                        the original covenanted contract. This repurchase would not decrease the
                        open parklike spaciousness of the allotments themselves but would ultimately
                        prevent its being used for farm purposes.</p>
                    <p>Different functions call for different handling. The requirements of this
                        property are threefold –</p>
                    <p><hi rend="ul">First</hi>:- A sufficient area should be retained in absolute
                        ownership by the Estate to meet present and future requirements for
                        conventions, management, housing, parking of cars, etc. for the World Center
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>The area to the North West of the Old Road is sufficient for these needs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="ul">Second</hi>:- The area to the South of Old Road and East of
                        Route 16 is sufficient and is advantageously located for a business center
                        with roads already constructed on 3 sides. The Estate should retain the
                        ownership of this district developing and renting it for business purposes.
                        It is in such a district that land values rise and it</p>
                    <pb n="271"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 271 ====]</p>
                    <p>should be controlled so that the business shall not be hampered by excessive
                        prices and so that the unearned increment can be used to the benefit of the
                        Organization or for the whole community.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="ul">Third</hi>:- The greater part or the acreage is on the slopes
                        of the hill facing toward the fine view of Mt. Chocorua. The northern
                        boundary skirts the shores of Whitten Pond, a charming lake big enough for
                        boating and lending itself to all the water sports-fishing, swimming, etc.
                        All this is ideal for residential purposes where land values do not become
                        excessive. It is beautifully forested with giant pines interspersed with
                        maples, birch and beech, so it is wonderful in its Autumn display as well as
                        in its all the year round impressiveness and charm.</p>
                    <p>1st – Convention Center has sufficient area to have a permanent parklike
                        district around the Lodge, its present charming domicile, or any future
                        building erected for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>In addition there is acreage enough for an outer driveway with a dozen or
                        more allotments permanently held for world Fellowship purposes. All of these
                        open out to Chocorua views. The Lodge, a spacious and beautiful assembly
                        house, equipped with all the modern conveniences, is already located and
                        functioning here. No more beautiful spot could be found for a summer
                        vacation.</p>
                    <p>There would be no objection to building for rental purposes on the outer
                        drive for uses of not so permanent a nature as those developing in the
                        business center.</p>
                    <p>2nd – The Business center is at the junction of the North South thoroughfare,
                        Route 16, and of the Old Road coming in from the North East – a short cut
                        traffic route likely to develop more intensely later on as it connects with
                        Iona Lake where a group of summer outing cottages is already established.</p>
                    <p>A third side of this is bounded by a road running South East.</p>
                    <pb n="272"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 272 ====]</p>
                    <p>This district would ultimately include not only commercial business but
                        Hotel, Town Hall, Post Office, Police Station and the housing of such public
                        and semi-public functions as are of a less domestic character. A hostel and
                        an assembly building are already established here.</p>
                    <p>The converging of 3 routes already constructed foreshadows the development of
                        a considerable business center here especially as Chocorua Mountain trail
                        along the Chocorua River and to the peak come in close to this junction. For
                        the present and for some time to come everything east of the Route 16 street
                        frontage allotments may well be used as a farm as its neighbors to the north
                        are doing. It could even be rented out at reasonable rates for this purpose,
                        but title should be retained.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the business area the unit of 60 feet has been used as it is a
                        practical one for building construction as well as for occupancy. Half of it
                        – 30 feet is a good unit for shop frontage construction. The first shop for
                        rent should be built with the intention of an ultimate group around an
                        interior court. As it grows the residential quarters could be built across
                        the court, opening up to the Plaza to the East.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that in the course of time the water of the stream be
                        impounded to form a pool in the Plaza, which in the course of time could
                        become surrounded by attractive and unique shops, restaurants, etc., a
                        wayside drop-in for tourists, with band-stand on the center island.</p>
                    <p>That the property is not on a railroad becomes less and less important for
                        residential centers with the expansion of motor services, surface and air
                        transportation. This property is strategically located for a village which
                        can be self-sufficient and yet retain its character. The finished
                        thoroughfare, Route 16, connects it</p>
                    <pb n="273"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 273 ====]</p>
                    <p>with Conway a railroad station 7 miles to the North East. A good road
                        furnishes a short cut for a considerable part of the way and comes into
                        Route 16 only a short distance from an East West road which goes to Madison,
                        railroad station 4 miles to the East. These converging roads determine a
                        natural business district sufficient in area to meet the requirements of
                        World Center and the properties adjacent to it on all sides. The
                        establishing of a shop here at the earliest possible moment would be an
                        important move.</p>
                    <p>3rd – The Residential area.</p>
                    <p>The placing of the houses on the South East side of Old Road well back on the
                        lot would be no disadvantage as they would have the open space of the park
                        back of them. If the same were done with the houses on the North West side
                        of Old Road the same advantage would apply and this would prevent these two
                        groups of houses from interfering with each others' views. This would be one
                        of the advantages of control by the Estate of both sides of Old Road.</p>
                    <p>All the houses on the Estate should be placed parallel to the Old Road. This
                        orientation is ideal for getting the sunlight on all 4 sides of the house.
                        It also gives maximum view of Mt. Chocorua. Maintaining this orientation
                        throughout the Residential area gives orderliness and dignity to the
                        district.</p>
                    <p>The whole area from the shores of Lake Whitten to the top of Fellowship Hill
                        is enchanting. All parts of it can be made easily accessible by circling
                        roads of easy grade, facilitated by each block's having its interior park
                        reserve. The terraces' rising from 700' to 1100' above sea level means that
                        the view of no residence need be blocked out by any other.</p>
                    <p>The streets are wide enough to provide ample space for grand avenues of
                        trees. The width also provides for a certain amount of diversion to avoid
                        special land or rock formations. Final surveys</p>
                    <pb n="274"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 274 ====]</p>
                    <p>will of course establish diversions to meet more important scenic features.</p>
                    <p>The lower Shore Drive, 175' wide, is ample for a two-way road with central
                        park and considerable parking space for convention times or other community
                        events.</p>
                    <p>Ample spaces for parks can be set aside at no cost since they are placed in
                        the interior of blocks and so occupy no street frontage. These reserves will
                        considerably increase the values of the lots which surround them since they
                        give a feeling of elegance to the whole district. When every block has its
                        own reserve they do not become the nuisance that they might be if only one
                        park served a larger district.</p>
                    <p>There are 115 allotments of 200' frontage. This should be sold as a
                        covenanted estate which increases its value as each owner knows that others
                        will be required to safeguard the natural beauty and so will have the
                        incentive to safeguard his own portion. Each citizen thus becomes a part of
                        a total police force watching out for the protection of the whole from fires
                        and other forms of devastation.</p>
                    <p>The beauty of this hillside lies not only in its outlook to Mount Chocorua,
                        the Fujiyama <note>Fuji-san</note> of the White Mountains, with its ever
                        changing moods through quiet mist to gorgeous sunsets, but quite as much if
                        not more in its majestic forestry. The charm of the view is enhanced if the
                        element of surprise is retained so that clearance for outlook should be
                        local and not general. The covenant should therefore require that no tree
                        more than 6 inches in diameter, say 6 feet above ground, could be cut
                        without permission of the Corporation or its architect.</p>
                    <p>Other interesting and charming features should be similarly safeguarded,
                        island reserves, etc., being set aside and approaches to them as they are
                        discovered, for the property is rich in such charms.</p>

                    <p>This requires the company's consent for the location of buildings on the
                        allotments. This is important for giving all residents maximum advantage and
                        assurance of vistas.</p>
                    <p>The 200' frontage of allotments facilitates this as well as the general slope
                        though 100' could be permitted in various places without endangering the
                        value of adjoining properties.</p>
                    <p>LAKE SHORE RESERVE</p>
                    <p>The wide flat land at the Western extremity of the Lake Shore Reserve seems a
                        strategic location for the large sports fields. The whole of the Lake shores
                        are reserved and the picturesque Eastern portion can be charmingly treated
                        with terraced community buildings for water sports, music hall, little
                        theatre in connection with a valley open air theatre, and other such
                        functions in the early stages of development before the citizenry has
                        occupied the higher terraces. Flat roofs on these structures would prevent
                        their being any obstruction to views later on and could be constructed for
                        use.</p>
                    <p>COMMUNITY CENTER RESERVE</p>
                    <p>The interior park of the Community Center is so lovely and so interesting
                        that special pains should be taken to reserve it in its natural state to
                        inspire all the children of the community through the coming generations.
                        The allotments surrounding it are of sufficient area for the buildings and
                        ordinary sports fields without going beyond the 225 feet from the street
                        lines. In this park is the lovely Haunted Pool and the precipitous bluff to
                        the East of it. Of course the idea is to keep the whole property as natural
                        as possible. It should be a magnet for nature lovers.</p>
                    <p>This circuit is removed from all speedways so safe for the children and when
                        evening comes it will be much pleasanter for the elders who in the morning
                        have to use the highway. So here are located all the cultural activities –
                        schools, libraries, museums, club-houses, little theatres, music halls,
                        churches, bowling alleys, etc.,</p>

                    <p>The Eastern half of the Circuit may suffice for these public and semi-public
                        structures and the Western half used for residential purposes for there is
                        the outlook to Chocorua.</p>
                    <p>The entrances and exits to all reserves give several ways for pedestrians to
                        take the steeper climbs than the roads afford, to the Peak Reserve. They
                        make charming walks with a thrill at the top where in course of time a Tower
                        Cafe might be established as a community service. The center height of Pine
                        Peak could be named Fellowship Peak.</p>
                    <p>The something over 100 allotments for sale will provide a fund for
                        construction of country roads and other expenses and functions of the World
                        Center Organization. 100 allotments each with 200 feet frontage makes 20,000
                        feet of salable frontage. The price could be low to start with and increase
                        as the development takes place.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="ul">FEDERAL CAPITAL AS AN ESSENTIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT</hi><lb/>
                        by WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN</p>
                    <p>I want to lay stress on two points:- the need for decentralization to insure
                        equal opportunity to all Australians - and on the menace to democracy of
                        bureaucracy. It is necessary that I should explain my point of view on
                        matters of political principles as that of an American. The American
                        political system differs from the British in that its elements are unified
                        in the form of a federation which means that no one of its units is in any
                        respect superior in authority to another.</p>
                    <p>From the American point of view, the absolute equality of all the units is
                        the fundamental necessity for democracy. Any other system is aristocracy,
                        the essential point of which latter system is that certain individuals or
                        groups are in a position to take advantage of the others. It is easy to see
                        that the Americans might feel that in the early period after the war for
                        independence it might have been considered in England that the close
                        organization of the various States would increase their strength and from
                        her point of view be undesirable since at that time the theory of business
                        was, and is even up to the present time, that strength and prosperity in
                        another community creates a rival and that this is a disadvantage and a
                        danger. This point of view is, of course, quite contrary to the belief of
                        democrats. Otherwise democracy becomes impossible.</p>
                    <p>Americans have always felt that a most vital step in the unifying of the
                        States was the location of its capital city in a district of its own
                        entirely removed from any of the established cities with their individual
                        State traditions.</p>
                    <p>It may be interesting to consider for a moment what would have been the
                        consequences of control at long distance on national and commercial
                        undertakings at the time of the federation of the United States into a
                        nation. What would have been the prospects of the speedy growth and
                        prosperity of that community if the United States had had to defer to Europe
                        as to the establishment of the city of Washington</p>
                    <pb n="278"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 278 ====]</p>
                    <p>or as to the building of its Parliament House. It seems obvious that existing
                        jealousies between New York and Philadelphia might have been used, where
                        direct control could not be enforced, to obstruct and delay the unification
                        of the States.</p>
                    <p>If the question of the manufacture of munitions was a question to be decided
                        from without, it would certainly have been prevented, or certainly
                        obstructed. Were commercial undertakings of a nature to rival those of the
                        supreme authority in Europe they would naturally have been obstructed. To an
                        American that is the meaning of the word "colony" - a community restricted
                        in the lines of development by the supposed interests of its imperial head.</p>
                    <p>From the democratic point of view, federation, eliminating entirely the
                        ascendance of any particular group, is the only system tolerable, as the
                        only one based on justice. In the theory of the United States organization
                        there is no possible excuse for the supremacy of New York because of its
                        wealth or population, or Texas <note>"Massachusetts" has been crossed
                        out.</note> because of its great extent, or for their having any advantage
                        whatsoever or any control whatsoever over any other unit. With this theory
                        inculcated in him from youth, an American naturally feels that the removal
                        of the National capital of Australia to quarters of its own would be a great
                        step toward loosening the bonds which <hi rend="ul">rendered ministers and
                            parliaments and the people impotent</hi>, as they seem to be at the
                        present time, and that its establishment in a district of its own would
                        quickly wipe out community jealousies and develop the broad national spirit.
                        A United Nation is not easy to exploit.</p>
                    <p>It is generally supposed that the reason why progress at the Federal Capital
                        is being opposed is because of the war or because it is an extravagance.
                        This we feel is not the case. The extravagance is in keeping the capital in
                        an established industrial city which necessitates buying very expensive land
                        if new buildings are to be erected. The whole site of Canberra cost only
                        what the land for one big</p>
                    <pb n="279"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 279 ====]</p>
                    <p>building such as Parliament House would cost in Melbourne or Sydney - or
                        paying very high rents as is now being done all over Melbourne for the
                        housing of the various departments. The Government of a country, especially
                        when run on a socialistic plan as it is in Australia, is a very big
                        business. When it is brought forth as an objection to Canberra that it is
                        not advantageously located for the development of industries, that fact is
                        forgotten. The same is true of Berlin which, as well as Washington, offers
                        an example of sufficiency of the Government, with the addition of its
                        social, scientific and aesthetic appeal, to form a unit quite large and
                        important enough to be an individual city.</p>
                    <p>If someone would gather the facts as to the running cost of the Government
                        rentals and capitalize it - for the Government of the nation is under no
                        necessity of paying constant interest and rent as an individual without
                        capital might be forced to do - we would be made to realize what an enormous
                        extravagance it is to permit the national capital to remain in Melbourne.
                        Single Taxers will understand that, in fact, the whole expense of the
                        construction of Canberra can be met without any taxation of Australia
                        because of the splendid stand taken in the initial steps in nationalizing
                        the land. It is dimly fell that it is to the interest of Melbourne to keep
                        the capital here, again Single Taxers will realize that that means simply
                        that it is to the interest of the land owners, for the crowding of business
                        into one center greatly increases the rent and that is not to the interest
                        of anyone else, but the contrary. The rest of the people have to pay the
                        high rents along with the Government which means that they pay twice over,
                        once in rent, again in taxation.</p>
                    <p>It is only a stupid misuse of the word loyalty - loyalty to your city -
                        loyalty to your state - that blinds the people to their own interests. We
                        are so reluctant to demand explicit statements. Why is it to my interest
                        because I am an inhabitant of Melbourne to keep the</p>

                    <p>capital here? In what way do I reap advantage? Very few people realize what a
                        big business a Government is and how it is housed all over Melbourne putting
                        rents into the pockets of private individuals. Big industries are learning,
                        when they have to expand, to get out into virgin country where they can get
                        cheap land. The Government organization has no such pressure on it today
                        because it is not spending its own money but the tax payers'. Why should
                        they bother to watch out for economies?</p>
                    <p>And why is it that other businesses are coming into Melbourne instead of
                        going out into the smaller towns and the country districts? Well, the
                        inhabitants of Bendigo can tell you, and of Geelong. It is because the big
                        interests of Melbourne, with the government close at hand, have been able to
                        put sufficient pressure on it to get the Railroads to grant discriminatory
                        rates in favor of Melbourne. We are accustomed to think this system is one
                        of the evils distinctive of privately owned railroads and in the United
                        States the chief reason for advocating Government ownership is to overcome
                        this evil, but we find the same thing is done in Australia and when the
                        Government is the instrument where can we look for redress?</p>
                    <p>One might say if we cannot control our agents when they are directly managing
                        a business how can we when they are merely a court of appeal and a police
                        organ? That brings us to the root of the difficulties, which is the
                        necessity for removing the incentives and for keeping the organization of
                        Governments simple enough to control. If a Government carries on businesses
                        outside the maintenance of equity it must have a tremendous organization
                        which forms a huge mass of voters who can easily hold in their hands the
                        destiny of any politician. Private ownership can never form so huge a
                        monopoly as that of a bureaucracy which also has the power not only of
                        collecting the profits of its business but can pour into the business the
                        huge sums gathered by taxation in general, thus increasing the number of its</p>

                    <p>employees indefinitely without increasing the amount of work done or the
                        service rendered to the public.</p>

                        decentralizing nature of the Federal Capital enterprise in the Town Planning
                        so called convention in Adelaide. The outer district delegates were strong
                        and even bitter in their desire for decentralization though they had no
                        concrete suggestions to make. But when it came to the question of pressing
                        on with the Federal Capital they either had no conception of it as the first
                        necessary step to accomplish the ends they were futilely struggling for or,
                        as is more probable, were blinded by their long training in the idea that
                        they must be loyal to Victoria. A strange idea that what will benefit
                        another state must therefore injure one's own. It is a big story I have
                        started on so I can only touch on these points hoping you will be led to
                        investigate how, for example, higher rates are charged for raw material sent
                        to Bendigo than brought to Melbourne and on the other hand lower rates on
                        manufactured goods sent from Melbourne than brought into it.</p>
                    <p>This process of centralization which is pressed and determined by selfish
                        individual interests whose foresight extends at the utmost to the length of
                        those individuals' life time is gradually choking the development of the
                        country, destroying the rural development immediately and will ultimately
                        destroy the development of the few big cities none of which is
                        self-supporting nor reproductive. If it continues much longer the country
                        will indeed fall into the hands of some other peoples who have a more
                        rational social policy. It is of prime importance that the control of these
                        private individuals over the government should be stopped and that the
                        bureaucratic system which has grown up should be scrapped.</p>
                    <p>To make clear the significance of what is to follow I am going to say that
                        the great enemy of liberty and justice in this country</p>

                    <p>as in every European country including America is the established
                        bureaucracy. That bureaucracy is as autocratic in Australia as it was in
                        Russia before the revolution with the exception that before the war its
                        military branch was not so highly developed. Whoever may be the apparent
                        mischief makers, whether it be a journalist here or a Town Planning
                        Organization somewhere else, they are usually but instruments, often
                        unwittingly, and would in any case be powerless for any great evil were it
                        not for the backing of the bureaucracy which is permanent and continuous and
                        over whom the community has no control whatever.</p>
                    <p>The definition of a <hi rend="ul">bureaucracy</hi> is a Civil Service
                        organization, with permanent officers.</p>
                    <p>The establishment of that system in Australia was probably an easy matter
                        since the members of the early parliaments, being ignorant of the insidious
                        evils of the system, through pressure from Europe and the pressure of a
                        public opinion (which can easily be blinded by a highly developed publicity
                        organization to think that the Civil Service means civil service) can fail
                        to realize that Civil Servant means despotic autocrat. The abolishing of the
                        system is extremely difficult. Its existence forms a line of direct control
                        of Australia by England since all the ultimate rewards of officials -
                        titles, etc., emanate from London.</p>
                    <p>The importance of the Federal Capital as a basic issue in the development of
                        the Commonwealth is not generally recognized and has been obscured by the
                        fact that the jealousy of a little group of architects has made the getting
                        rid of a rival paramount to all national issues, so easy is it for a few
                        noisy ones to obscure the issues from the general public. The grim joke back
                        of this is that even were the rival eliminated the work would not fall to
                        the profession for the main obstacle to progress lies in the bureaucracy
                        which permits no interference with its monopoly whether Australian</p>

                    <p>or non-Australian. In fact at the present time I believe the Federal Capital
                        director is the only outside expert who has not been driven out and the
                        Federal Capital Royal Commission I think will be found to be the only one
                        that has given a judgment in favor of an outsider.</p>
                    <p>The powerlessness of Parliament and of the Ministry and the absolute power of
                        the bureaucracy is illustrated once again by the fact that the officers
                        found guilty in the serious charges investigated by the Royal Commission
                        were none of them dismissed, but some on the contrary have received increase
                        of salary or promotion. That it is typical of such organizations is
                        illustrated in Lord Northcliffe's <note>Alfred Charles William
                        Harmsworth's</note> recent letter refusing to accept the position of
                        Minister of the Air in which he states that he is not willing to put himself
                        in a position which would require loyalty to officers for some of whom he
                        can have no such feeling, stating that there are cases where officers who
                        should have been punished have been retained and even promoted. On the other
                        hand Ministers who in the interests of the Nation opposed themselves to the
                        bureaucracy are thrown out of office as in the case of Mr. <note>King</note>
                        O'Malley and Mr. <note>William</note> Webster. The officials' confidence in
                        their power to do this has been illustrated within the last few days.
                        Speaking of the new party in the State of Victoria which contains men
                        sincerely determined to try to achieve some measure of efficiency and
                        economy, an officer - a bureaucrat - said:- "It doesn't make any difference
                        who are made Ministers. They won't be in more than two months."</p>
                    <p>The pernicious power of the bureaucracy in England is suggested also by the
                        recent speech by <note>David</note> Lloyd George who used adjectives of such
                        a nature in describing policies followed during his own administration as
                        Minister as it is inconceivable that a man in any way responsible should use
                        if he has not, in fact, found it impossible to fulfill the functions of his
                        position. An exposure of similar conditions in France recently was made by
                        the head of the chamber. Monsieur Duschanel <note>Paul Deschanel?</note> who
                        placarded France with an appeal to the people in the</p>

                    <p>controversy between the parliament and the military bureaucracy. This placard
                        stated that Parliament which was held responsible by the people was being
                        kept in ignorance of facts by the generals and could not, of course, be
                        responsible if it had to act without knowledge; that the truth was that
                        whatever efficiency or promptness there had been in meeting the necessities
                        of the war had been brought about by the Parliament in opposition to and
                        only by breaking down the routine of the Civil Service. In this emergency
                        when one General after another was refusing to accept the post of Head of
                        the Army he appealed to the people for patience with Parliament since, in
                        fact, Parliament was, he said, the best instrument yet devised to oppose
                        bureaucracy. How this contest resulted, whether in victory of Parliament or
                        of the Bureaucracy, is difficult to know at this distance. Apparently the
                        appeal of Lloyd George in his speech arose from similar circumstances. (In
                        fact the congressional form of government is the only one that can be
                        successful.)</p>
                    <p>We find that the opposition to the Federal Capital, aside from private
                        interests such as landlords of Melbourne, etc., comes from two sources,
                        England and the Bureaucracy of Australia. One of the methods used to
                        obstruct the development of the Federal Capital was the tremendous effort
                        made to establish the Arsenal within its boundaries or, when foiled in that,
                        as close as possible to it. The menace to popular government of the
                        juxtaposition of a great military establishment with the Capital is too
                        familiar in history to need comment. The instance of the destruction of
                        Washington is but one among many.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the military danger, the surrounding of Parliament by such an
                        influence would be as disastrous in its way as the surrounding of it by the
                        great financial interests of industrial cities. The fact that the
                        manufacture of munitions for which Australia has ample facilities was
                        stopped in the early stages of the war, is by</p>
                    <pb n="287"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 287 ====]</p>
                    <p>no means countered by the encouragement to establish such an arsenal city. In
                        the first place the arsenal committee, taken seriously by some, was not
                        permitted by the British authorities to go to England but was sent to India
                        where its investigations of an antiquated arsenal could not but be an utter
                        waste of time. Should the arsenal be built on such lines it would be no
                        competitor of European plants but a total waste of the money invested.
                        Further than this the establishment of such an industry at Canberra or
                        anywhere within the Federal District with its entire lack of industrial
                        facilities, even if the design were in accordance with the most modern
                        developments would, because of the high cost of materials and
                        transportation, prevent its output from ever competing in the World's
                        markets and, if continued, could be a huge burden to Australia. The fact
                        that the Federal District is but a short distance from the coast means also
                        that in case of attack the aeroplane <note>airplane</note> offensive
                        naturally directed against the arsenal would easily result in its
                        destruction and in the destruction of the Capital. Persistence in such a
                        method cannot be attributed to ignorance.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these considerations is the fact that the temporary loss of
                        control of the Federal Capital enterprise by the bureaucracy which was
                        accomplished by the efficient management of Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Webster
                        could be made a negligible thing if they were permitted to build up within
                        the city's boundaries, or within a short distance of it, an enormous
                        industry and the community it would necessitate, backed by the huge funds at
                        their disposal while their tremendous publicity organization was preventing
                        any expenditure on the capital city as such; for were such a city, without
                        the boundary of the capital site, once established it would be easy to plead
                        folly in starting a second one so close at hand and consequently the capital
                        would find itself located on the new, the arsenal, site instead of the
                        original site determined by Parliament. Thus can the</p>
                    <pb n="288"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 288 ====]</p>
                    <p>decisions of Parliament be rendered void. The brief summary of the
                        bureaucracy's control of the Federal Capital as made public in the Royal
                        Commission is illuminating. The carrying out of such an undertaking opens
                        the way naturally to jealousies, ambitions and intrigue, and the spending of
                        huge sums upon it would not be at all objectionable to England since the
                        taxpayers of Australia alone have to foot the bill, and the officers could
                        well look forward to distinctions to be granted, such rewards as often
                        accruing to futile as to useful services rendered, and in the case of the
                        Capital the more futile the more acceptable to England.</p>
                    <p>The British member of the international jury for the adjudication of the
                        Parliament House, after two hundred architects had in all good faith been
                        working for months and spending hundreds of dollars, many having practically
                        completed their drawings, writes out to the Australian Minister that the war
                        offers a good opportunity to break the contract with these competitors which
                        breach of faith would make it possible to put the work in the hands of some
                        British architect. This was not the breaking of contract with competitors in
                        enemy countries for that had already been provided for, but with those of
                        neutral and allied countries, and even perhaps with those of Australia
                        itself. It is incredible that an individual or private institution with a
                        reputation to guard could make a suggestion of such a nature if he were not
                        conscious of support of an organization which could protect him from
                        consequences. A Minister of Australia when deputized by a number of members
                        of Parliament to press on with the work, most important if we are looking
                        for development in Australia, entailing an expenditure absolutely negligible
                        if the truth were told, says he will cable to the architects of England to
                        see if they think it advisable to go on. That such suggestions are not made
                        in good faith is illustrated by the first abandonment of the competition on
                        the advice of the bureaucracy on the plea that the war made it inadvisable</p>
                    <pb n="289"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 289 ====]</p>
                    <p>that such expenditure should be made. A week after the Minister acted on
                        their advice they were advising him to launch a competition of their own
                        devising. The exposure of such proceedings has been the Federal Director's
                        chief work during the past three years, and they have been stopped only by
                        their exposure.</p>
                    <p>A permanent officialdom means a monopoly. It means autocracy utterly
                        uncontrolled and uncontrollable. It means subordination of all the rest of
                        the community's need to its own interests. It is both inefficient and
                        tyrannical. A single autocrat may be efficient, a bureaucracy never.
                        Efficiency within its ranks threatens it as much as efficiency outside so
                        will not be tolerated and if by any chance it exists it will never be
                        allowed promotion.</p>
                    <p>It is apparent that the existence, if continued, of such an organization is
                        imperiled by the presence within its fold, or even in the country, of
                        experienced technical or scientific men. The whole strength therefore of the
                        Civil Service would naturally be exerted to minimize education in the
                        country (and therefore we cannot look for proper development of the schools)
                        and to prevent anyone coming in from the outside world. The driving out of
                        any such is of first importance to them and much of their time and of the
                        money of the taxpayers is spent in accomplishing that end. Since they are
                        permanent, there is no limit to the amount of time they can so spend. Once
                        rid of such experts as are occasionally brought in by some Minister who
                        hopes to accomplish something, they are free again to pour untold sums of
                        money no one knows where. The million pounds which has been utterly wasted
                        at Canberra, finally put a stop to by an independent practitioner whose
                        future career is dependent on his successfully and economically carrying out
                        the undertaking he is entrusted with can, as soon as he is gotten rid of, be
                        doubled and trebled without interference. The policy of stopping expenditure
                        on the Federal Capital at present being followed would doubtless be
                        immediately reversed could he be gotten rid of,</p>

                    <p>for if a minister should oppose - he in his turn could be gotten rid of.
                        England would not object to this since futile and wasteful expenditure would
                        ultimately of itself choke the undertaking to death.</p>
                    <p>At any rate since the Federal Capital was stipulated in the Federation of the
                        States the bureaucracies naturally determined to keep control of it.</p>
                    <p>Their first lost battle was when the Minister, Mr. O'Malley, with his
                        foresight and broad vision, insisted that there should be an international
                        competition to determine the plan. Mr. O'Malley considered that the best the
                        world could offer was none too good for Australia. The bureaucracies laid
                        out a program for competition and presented it to the Minister. Their second
                        failure to obtain their ends was when in accepting the program for
                        competition, the Minister crossed out the names of the three judges whom
                        they had selected and determined upon the selection of three outside of the
                        direct control of the bureaucracy. This provoked great opposition, with
                        backing from England and through the Institute of Architects. After the
                        prize had been awarded in this competition the department officials
                        suggested to the Minister that a board of themselves should be authorized by
                        him to work out a plan for the city, using such ideas as they saw fit from
                        the premiated plans. Not being a town planner or technical expert as
                        obviously a Minister cannot be, he did not recognize the absurdity from a
                        technical point of view of such a procedure. His officers were supposed to
                        be technical men although the civil service requirements in fact make it
                        impossible that the permanent officials should contain any experts, the
                        requirements that any man beyond a certain age - 21 years - cannot enter the
                        service makes it impossible for any member to have had technical training
                        and experience without both of which a man is not an expert. He accepted the
                        suggestion that a board should gather suggestions from other than the first
                        plan to include in it but stipulated that the design of the city must be
                        that of the</p>
                    <pb n="291"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 291 ====]</p>
                    <p>first prize plan. When the Department plan was brought to him he asked if
                        that were the case, and seeing that he was set on that point they said yes
                        although, in fact, it was not in any respect based on the first prize plan.
                        It was, in fact, ridiculed as an absurdity when it came to the attention of
                        the technical press. However, as a consequence of this by no means
                        disinterested advice of the department officers, the work of the competitors
                        and of the judges, themselves technical men, was thrown into the scrap heap.
                        The Minister cabled the King that work was to begin on the Federal Capital
                        in accordance with the premiated plan, and work was begun but on the
                        departmental lines.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after, the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime
                        Minister - the opposite party now being in power - was brought to this
                        matter and they invited the designer of the premiated plan to come to
                        consult with them which he did, the result of which consultation was that
                        the Departmental Board was disbanded and the designer put in charge of the
                        execution of the work.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the departmental heads has been published in the course of
                        the evidence of the Royal Commission. Mr. Griffin being greeted when he took
                        the first step to fulfill his duties which was a request for data, with -
                        "I'll be damned if I'll take orders from you." When the Minister attempted
                        to bring about a working basis he was told he would precipitate the greatest
                        rumpus the Department had ever known if he persisted. His political future
                        was also threatened by them. He did not discontinue his efforts and shortly
                        after his party was thrown out of office. The case with which the Civil
                        Service organization can throw any politician out of power becomes very
                        apparent when we realize that one in every 12 of the population, men, women
                        and children is a civil servant, so that in fact every two men in the
                        community have a civil servant to carry on their backs. The voting power of
                        such a body of men is obvious. Also their indirect</p>
                    <pb n="292"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 292 ====]</p>
                    <p>power through a publicity organization which can flood the press at the
                        expense of the taxpayers is enormous.</p>
                    <p>The next minister in office accepted the advice of the Bureaucracy, at no
                        time consulting the Federal Capital Director, but the fearful extravagance
                        indulged in at this time, and since exposed by the Royal Commission, was
                        brought to an end through the exposure of the methods being followed, by a
                        movement within the party itself which again changed the personnel of the
                        Home Affairs ministry.</p>
                    <p>The power of the bureaucracy over the career of politicians may perhaps be
                        illustrated by the fact that this Minister who stopped extravagance, placed
                        authority where it belonged by the contract entered into by the Government,
                        and actually started movement along lines determined by both parties, was
                        soon afterward driven out of Parliament. The politician ambitious for
                        advancement does well not to oppose himself to the bureaucracy. Their power,
                        almost incredible did we not realize that an absolute monopoly is in fact
                        all powerful, is illustrated by the fact that all of the men exposed by the
                        Royal Commission as outrageously extravagant, spending millions of pounds in
                        utterly extravagant or useless ways, keeping books in such fashion as to
                        make it impossible for anyone to know how moneys have been spent,
                        misinforming ministers as to facts and ignoring and even going contrary to
                        definite instructions of the Ministers, still retain their positions and in
                        some instances, as I have said, have had salaries raised or rank advanced.
                        In fact no one can dismiss a permanent official no matter what he does.</p>
                    <p>As an illustration of the stand they took, I will cite the amazing statement
                        of the head of these Departments:- When questioned by the Royal Commissioner
                        he said words to this effect that he did not feel called upon to acquiesce
                        in the Minister's decision to put certain work in the hands of an expert
                        employed for a particular</p>
                    <pb n="293"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 293 ====]</p>
                    <p>purpose. He had been made head of the Home Affairs Department by appointment
                        of the Executive, that is the Governor General, and therefore did not
                        consider that any of the other rules of Parliament need be heeded. His
                        authority from the crown gave him a monopoly of government work in the Home
                        Affairs Department of Australia and took precedence of any further acts of
                        Parliament however authorized. In other words the provision of the Civil
                        Service Act for employment of temporary men for special purposes the
                        permanent officials do not intend to heed. If this assumption were granted
                        it would mean Parliament would have no power. In fact that is the case
                        though not openly understood.</p>
                    <p>I have wished to place before you a few of the facts that have come within
                        our experience. It becomes constantly more evident that if we desire results
                        either in the way of war or of peace our communities at home or abroad must
                        find a substitute for the bureaucratic system which is at present universal
                        in white communities.</p>
                    <p>The control of the government of Australia by the cities has limited the
                        transportation to the coastal districts. This alone is sufficient to
                        manifest the necessity of the Capital's standing on its own foundations
                        since, as the Governor General puts it, "A country population is so
                        essential to the present prospects and future safety of Australia."</p>

                    <p>The general formation of the land hereabouts in Texas gives a unique problem
                        to the occupancy designer. It forms a series of almost flat terraces with
                        quite sudden drops to the terraces below. Hence the form of the layout is
                        the reverse of rectangular, but adjusted to the succession of hilltops and
                        the series of terraces encircling them down to the river flats.</p>
                    <p>The present thoroughfare from San Antonio to Boerne establishes the location
                        of the business center. The details are laid out only for the property
                        unified under a single ownership.</p>
                    <p>For the most part park reserves follow the rivers. The School Group and
                        encircling grounds however are practically flat.</p>

                    <p>A basic principle in Community planning is to reverence and preserve nature,
                        fixing the development which may continue through time in such a way as to
                        retain the character of the district, enhancing but never destroying, so
                        that the generations to come may be surrounded by the charms that the
                        creative nature Beings have spent the millenniums in bringing about.</p>
                    <p>In the water molded hills of this lovely spot we find in miniature, but no
                        less effective, the perpetually varying effects of mountain scenery -
                        heights and valleys, plains and gullies, intimate charms and wide views over
                        the hills to the picturesque horizon. The whole district, which is
                        cretaceous, is already naturally terraced as if by a formal mind to preserve
                        a feeling of grandeur. Let us hope each individual citizen will treat these
                        terraces reverently. They make it easy to set houses so that one tier
                        overlooks another giving all the citizenry unobstructed wide views. Proper
                        consideration for one's neighbor would, in general, keep the roofs flat
                        which gives the occupant an added terrace for use in any of innumerable ways
                        - for landing places for the gyroscope planes of the near future, for water
                        reservoirs which would help keep the home cool in the hot season, or for
                        choice gardens so that from the sky the whole will be lovely nature as it is
                        now, or for general outdoor living.</p>
                    <p>An example could be set here which if followed would transform Texas, "the
                        most important thing which its citizens could do" for the state in which
                        they take such pride - preserve the water</p>

                    <p>of the rainfall - which has been tested and found practicable - by
                        establishing a series of dams small or large along every stream. The lay of
                        the land which has been cut into deep gullies by the volumes of rushing
                        torrents lends itself perfectly to this treatment and would add an
                        innumerable variety of lovely features for the delight and education of all
                        its citizenry - pools, caves, open fields, steep precipices, waterfalls,
                        streams flowing throughout the year - to accomplish which the fairies need
                        human help. The water supply is adequate but wasted at present. After all it
                        is high time humans changed their policy of destroying nature because of the
                        greed of one generation and made it their task and their joy to save and
                        enhance. Indeed only so can the children of the future be healthy in body
                        and soul or secure an education which will enable them to develop creative
                        thinking which is the essence of spirit.</p>
                    <p>The plan of this community provides its citizenry with all urban advantages
                        and at the same time retains all the rural advantages. The long and varied
                        walks will still be there when occupation has been completed, and the system
                        of parks interfacing with allotment groups makes all the distinctive
                        features permanently available to everybody. Every allotment has its street
                        frontage and its park frontage so one park will not be overcrowded because
                        other districts lack similar advantages. The whole boundary of the property
                        is retained for the community, and park paths connect all the larger open
                        spaces. Adventure will always be there, hill climbing, waterside rambles,
                        wide open views and the wild life that can be encouraged to take domicile
                        here. The whole gamut of natural features is there and calls for the
                        romantic type of plan. In fact it would be impossible to build the deadly
                        gridiron plan for there are hills and steep gullies, flats and precipices,
                        so there is a touch of gaiety in what formality</p>

                    <p>has been achieved.</p>
                    <p>The general lay of the land of the whole district round about has established
                        main roads on a diagonal to the North and South of the compass, which means
                        that the ideal orientation for residences - at 45 degrees to East West so
                        that all the rooms get the sun and all get the shade - is practically
                        parallel to the main thoroughfares which facilitates the establishment of
                        this bit of formality which becomes important as the building increases and
                        adds a pleasant element of the comprehensible especially when viewed from
                        the air.</p>
                    <p>The property, about 2 square miles, cuts diagonally across a 2 mile square
                        district. It is an especially picturesque district the adjoining areas being
                        wide flat ranches with hills and mountains in the distance. Its destiny as a
                        residential center is written in its richly varied topography.</p>
                    <p>The type of development shown here could be followed to advantage by the
                        immediately adjoining properties by extending radial thoroughfares and the
                        town might become a city. San Antonio is about three quarters of an hour's
                        drive to the South East and the town of Boerne some twenty minutes to the
                        North West. That is enough for rail service. It would not be desirable to
                        have this lovely district industrialized.</p>
                    <p>The thoroughfare between these two cities crosses a corner of the estate thus
                        establishing the location of the Civic Center. Other radial avenues will be
                        directed to the point where the present road - Lloyd Drive - comes into
                        Boerne Road. Another radial avenue is directed from this center to the South
                        West to meet Old Boerne Road, an established thoroughfare. Another radial
                        Avenue - Bersodi <note>Borsodi?</note> Drive - could be established to
                        complete service to the surrounding districts. Along these thoroughfares the
                        business would naturally</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 299 ====]</p>
                    <p>gradually develop. The more secluded space between these thoroughfares
                        becomes the residential area. We thus establish the Thoroughfares and the
                        Distributive streets. Such foresight prevents the occurrence later on of
                        blighted districts for it is obvious that business could not maintain itself
                        on the devious roads of the residential areas. The thoroughfares provide
                        indefinity <note>indefinite?, infinite?</note> opportunity for the expansion
                        of business. The spaces between the radii offer permanent residential
                        advantages.</p>
                    <p>The junction of Lloyd Drive with Boerne Road having established the location
                        of the Civic Center, we take advantage of being on a thoroughfare to
                        establish there a business district for the pioneer days, the buildings
                        there being on a rental basis so as not to interfere with its transformation
                        later on to some important monumental building such as a Town Hall. At the
                        moment Boerne Road could be widened on the property to form a circle
                        sufficient for 6 shops - A,B,C,D,E,F - 3 on either side of the road. The
                        shops radiate back to a wider frontage on the great circle to be constructed
                        later. The next step in the years to come would be to get the Council to
                        permit the development of Boerne Road into this circle deviating the traffic
                        to encircle these shops forming a plaza. These shops would then make this
                        larger circle their frontage the small inner circle becoming their court -
                        and later on the court of the Town Hall. At present and for some time to
                        come there would be no widening of the road but simply a fixing of the line
                        or the inner circle, to fix the frontage of the shops, and a drive around
                        the future front for present loading.</p>
                    <p>Later on, as the community grows, these primitive shops could be abandoned
                        and the space used for its ultimate purpose - Town Hall, Opera House or what
                        you will. General business would then take its</p>

                    <p>place on the outer circle and gradually extend along the radial
                        Thoroughfares.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that a water reservoir and power could be developed on the
                        somewhat higher level of the North East corner of the Civic Center to make
                        water, plumbing and power available for the initial buildings. There is a
                        bit of a stream near by in Mr. Borsodi's <note>Bersodi's?</note>property.
                        Arrangements might be made with him for the use of this water in return for
                        entrance for the Borsodi <note>Bersodi?</note>radial thoroughfare to the
                        Civic Center.</p>
                    <p>ROSARY CRYSTALS</p>
                    <p>A second thoroughfare is already established - Lloyd Drive - extending to the
                        suburb ROSARY CRYSTALS. A little settlement is already established here and
                        here doubtless a suburban community will first develop, purely residential,
                        social and educational, depending on a bit of commuting for its general
                        services though certain services and crafts might well be initiated here and
                        become permanent, a home bakery, craft shops for weaving, modeling, etc., a
                        community laundry and other such homey services as well as kindergarten,
                        craft schools, library, etc. Services are already established - power,
                        electricity, water. The initial settlement might well be a close one and is
                        so indicated on the plan. To the East of the buildings already established
                        are quite lovely terraces for homesites and below them flat fields which
                        might well be used as small farms - nut groves, vegetable gardens chicken or
                        rabbit raising, etc., and on the terraces above, on Lolaberg way, are fine
                        building sites and a charming terraced spot for an open air theatre the open
                        fields below offering ample space for a good sized audience.</p>
                    <p>The broken country and the beautiful wide views which make thoroughfares
                        undesirable will establish Rosary Crystals as the spacious residential
                        district. The Northwestern part of this suburb has</p>
                    <pb n="301"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 301 ====]</p>
                    <p>extensive wide flats for the Air Plane field whose connection with the inner
                        park system - Crystal Park - offers fine opportunities for the Golf Links.</p>
                    <p>The gentle slopes have been made use of for roads giving access to the high
                        spots, the hill tops, around which the groups of allotments are swung so as
                        to give fine wide views to everybody. The crystalline groups of this suburb
                        district hang like beads on the main circuits of the Rosary. Here fancy is
                        tempted to run a bit wild. Wide and distant views, steep gullies, lovely
                        natural terraces - as if parked by a civilization of long ago - the work of
                        gnomes and undines and sylphs everywhere in evidence, the nature folk at
                        work and at play, ideal homesites for the children of today and tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The general characteristics of these Rosary Crystals is that their street
                        frontage is minimized, though ample for building dwellings on these high
                        spots, and then the lots widen as they extend over terrace after terrace so
                        that most of them contain picturesque natural features and all of them have
                        frontages on the reserves surrounding the crystals.</p>
                    <p>On the South West corner of Rosary Crystals are a group of lots with grand
                        views on an already established thoroughfare and a group of some 35
                        allotments on this highest terrace connect with this Old Boerne Road and so
                        have a short out to Boerne. The opening of an old country road along the
                        South boundary would give the rest of the Rosary Crystals district access to
                        this drive to Boerne.</p>
                    <p>It might be advisable to use the Crystal center parks on the high points as
                        reservoirs from which water could be piped down to each dwelling. This might
                        be a welcome supplementary supply if not sufficient to meet all needs.</p>

                    <p>HILL CRYSTALS</p>
                    <p>Let us return to the South Western area.</p>
                    <p>The two basic principles of Town Planning are communication and occupation.
                        The radial thoroughfares from one center to another establish the location
                        and development of business. If such are not established to begin with the
                        time comes when they have to be driven through at great expense. Since the
                        realtor wants rectangular blocks he gives no consideration to the need for
                        direct communication from point to point and even if such have been
                        established he plunks a gridiron system on top of them, even if he is laying
                        it out on a drawing board. The two problems should be solved at one and the
                        same time. This is done by establishing the radii and then bringing in the
                        distributive streets perpendicular to them. This makes all lots either
                        rectangular or obtuse which is just as satisfactory for building purposes,
                        just as economical. Therefore in the Civic Center we bring in the
                        distributive streets at right angles to the radial streets. Such a system,
                        as it extends further and further from the center, gives greater and greater
                        space for interior parks as should be the case as land becomes cheaper the
                        further it is removed from the closely occupied centers. These parks cost
                        nothing since they take up no street frontage.</p>
                    <p>Terrace Drive illustrates this point. Here just South of the Center are
                        lovely terraces for residential purposes sufficiently high to give all the
                        homes beautiful views of Park Mountain across the River especially if they
                        are built with flat roofs. The terrace drive is kept narrow to make this
                        possible for every house. The whole river and its banks are so interesting
                        and so varied that they have been dedicated as permanent park with one drive
                        along its western side open to this park - the Park Drive. It could be made
                        narrow and winding if nature calls for that treatment. It is the one park
                        drive. It skirts the River Park with its charming natural</p>
                    <pb n="303"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 303 ====]</p>
                    <p>features, - springs, waterfalls, pools, caves. On the other side of the River
                        we climb the mountain.</p>
                    <p>The Valley of the River's Western branch forms a grandiose amphitheatre for
                        play and pageant, with a mountain on either side. Park Drive and Mountain
                        View Drive skirting this theatre form a natural congregation point for Cafe,
                        Museum, Library, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Western half of this section which, being close to the Civic Center, will
                        naturally develop with a somewhat closer occupation than Rosary Crystals, is
                        the ultimate School Center. Maverick Circuit offers allotments with park as
                        well as street frontages. Its terraced allotments give fine opportunities
                        for terraced houses whose flat roofs become a charming part of the living
                        quarters.</p>
                    <p>There are 2 street and 2 parkway entrances to the school group in the center,
                        its buildings staggered so as to get the maximum outlook from all sides.
                        This method should be followed in the location of all the residences. The
                        schools surround an interior park or pool with a bandstand in the center,
                        and the school circuit is surrounded by playfields for supervised sports,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Connecting Hill Crystals and Rosary Crystals is a region of flat land which
                        lends itself to sports fields and larger allotments to be used as small
                        farms. Some of these skirt the river on up to the Spring.</p>
                    <p>The structures so far as possible should be of the local stone, a fine
                        building material. Nothing can give such a feeling of dignity and permanence
                        as stone or concrete.</p>
                    <p>There are approximately 200 residential and 40 business allotments.</p>

                    <p>AMERICA THE LAND OF ADVENTURERS &amp; AUSTRALIA BEFORE MR.
                        <note>John</note> CURTIN</p>
                    <p>Most of the adventurers of the world have come to America. Only here have the
                        doors been open to all who would come. Out of this difference of policy
                        America has developed a different type of character from Australia which has
                        an almost equal area, except for Alaska, of inexhaustible resources, for
                        this talk about desert in Australia is nonsense. She has no more than her
                        share if we speak continentally but like the rest of us she is increasing
                        aridity as fast as possible.</p>
                    <p>I nearly threw a riot in a group of my beloved friends in Casa Bonita when I
                        announced my conclusion that there was this marked difference in the ideals
                        of Australians and Americans; the Australian's ideal aristocracy, the
                        American's democracy; the Australian interest in getting out of doing, the
                        American's in doing. The difference has been encouraged by the fact that on
                        the whole no one has been assisted in coming to the United States. Each one
                        has taken on his own adventure and no one has helped him after he got over
                        here. He has had his own battle to fight and win, whereas to a large extent
                        Australian immigration has been assisted (even to the remittance men who in
                        a way are paid to stay away from Britain) and after arrival they look for
                        and demand assistance. They feel the world owes them a living. They have yet
                        to learn that they not only determined their circumstances before birth but
                        even chose their parents and brought them together before their birth. As a
                        consequence in Australia there is little kindliness outside of one's own
                        circle. So little of this is there in Australia that practically everyone
                        who moves digs up the plants he has planted and takes them along to the next
                        place. Usually they die but that is better than leaving them for the other
                        fellow. I remember the surprised look in a man's face - a highly cultured
                        and nice man too - when I suggested he go ahead with building on a homesite
                        he owned though he might have to leave it later, that he make of it another
                        paradise as he had of one before. "What for someone else," he said. And I
                        said, "Yes, why not go on making paradises for other people."</p>
                    <pb n="305"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 305 ====]</p>
                    <p>Of our own experience with young folks we have known, when they come to
                        America they are welcomed, given hospitality, given jobs even in preference
                        to home folks out of the feeling that they are "a long ways from home."
                        Quite the contrary in Australia. This is definitely the result of the
                        differences of the social systems under which they live. Even if immigration
                        lasted for a while, they swiftly put up the barriers against further
                        incomers. This is carried to an absurdity in Australia where the population
                        of a good sized city lays claim to a whole continent nearly as big as the
                        United States. Social relations may be very pleasant but when one enters the
                        economic realm he finds everyone, individually and collectively against him
                        tooth and claw. The reaction on themselves of this spirit is that within the
                        community itself ability or excellence in any direction is hindered,
                        opposed, prevented from functioning.</p>
                    <p>Brought up with the notion that the farther west one goes the more advanced
                        democracy one will find, and having been inclined to accept Australian
                        propaganda at its face value, an American gets a painful shock on arriving
                        there where he finds himself in Europe with a vengeance. One suddenly finds
                        out all about Colonial America stripped of the glamour of the distance of a
                        hundred and fifty years. Suddenly he understands why the American revolution
                        took place and begins to comprehend the significance of the American
                        constitution. And gradually one becomes terrified at America's ignorance of
                        European affairs and systems. A transient traveler cannot see inner truths
                        but when one undertakes to live in (I do not mean retire to) a European
                        community he begins to know. Also he begins to lose that joyousness so
                        characteristic of America, for everything he has been in the habit of
                        hanging his hopes to for bettering the future soon shows itself to be
                        futile. Reform movements even fundamental reforms he begins to realize offer
                        no help. And finally be sees that though purporting to be democratic or to
                        be tending toward democracy there has not in</p>

                    <p>reality been the slightest movement in that direction nor in fact the
                        slightest desire to move in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Americans have seen one community after another in Europe forced for one
                        reason or another to alter its form of government, seen them investigate
                        American and European systems and then adopt the parliamentary form. They
                        have been inclined to assume that this was because it was a better, a more
                        democratic, system than the congressional. The contrary of the fact.
                        Autocracies that have tormented their lower classes to desperation have
                        assumed this form because they can hide behind it in full strength and the
                        distracted community is like a new visitor to Sydney who searches in vain
                        for the flea that is sucking and poisoning his blood filling his whole body
                        with loathsome disease.</p>
                    <p>We have had the American system analyzed by Europeans. It is high time we had
                        the European system analyzed by Americans. To do this it is necessary to get
                        behind the curtain - no easy matter for all the portals and most cleverly
                        guarded, but for years Griffin was an observer from within the cabinet one
                        might almost say. We must remember that the Americans who wrote the
                        constitution were fresh from their experiences with the evils of the
                        parliamentary system and we should be thankful indeed that they made their
                        great effort center not entirely on escaping from a power over them but also
                        in solving the evils of the system under which they had been living.</p>
                    <p>In taking the stand that corruption was less in Europe either before the war
                        or now, there is a very important element that has been overlooked.
                        Corruption as commonly understood arises only when the underprivileged begin
                        to contest the claims of the privileged. Until that time the generally
                        accepted standard gives a propriety to the lack of fairness necessarily
                        involved in privilege which makes the use of the word corrupt
                        incomprehensible to the general community. This still obtains when the
                        underprivileged begin to object but still have no power to make their point
                        of view effective which is still the case</p>

                    <p>in Europe. The Labor Party now in office in England will be able to increase
                        the power of the bureaucracy but that is but removing them one step further
                        from democracy. The privileged element still has full power. It may grant
                        some philanthropy as much or as little as it wishes, but that is not of the
                        nature of justice. As the belief grows that privilege means unfairness
                        favors are granted from caution as well as philanthropy but when the
                        underprivileged reach a point where they have the power to enforce fairness
                        then privilege takes to hiding and corruption begins. In spite of the ugly
                        name this latter stage is far preferable to the earlier and indicates a
                        higher standard of morality and intelligence in the community. We might say
                        that is where America stood in 1930.</p>
                    <p>The next stage is to clear away all the mental confusions and realize that
                        there is nothing to gain by attacking corruption, which is a result, but
                        only by attacking the cause - privilege - and wiping it out of existence.
                        When that is done attention can then be turned to corruption (which in more
                        personal forms may still exist) and to minimize it by opening the doors to
                        opportunity for constructive use of ability through a triune organization of
                        the community with an Abilities Organ whose function is to give every
                        opportunity to ability. The cause of corruption has its stronghold in the
                        union of the Political and Economic systems. We should be able to recognize
                        it in its modern guises. It is most encouraging to find the present world
                        movements recognizing the necessity of building up Economical and Social
                        (Ability) organs as well as the Security (Equity) Organ, which is
                        essentially a police (military) organ.</p>
                    <p>The following was written by me in those early days. It has a note of
                        bitterness. That is gone now that I know the way out and know that Americans
                        are the ones who should effect it. No one anywhere has had the chances they
                        have had. There are certain terms whose meanings are unknown in the United
                        States though they are used there more or less freely. Among these are
                        "foreigner," "class," "government," </p>
                    <pb n="309"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 309 ====]</p>
                    <p>"Civil Servant." These words when understood eat into your soul and destroy
                        spiritual development. They turn men into beasts. They make then stupid,
                        callous, fiendish. They turn one's mind inward on oneself which as
                        physicians know is the process which develops insanity. They belong to
                        servile communities whose ideals are to cringe to the higher ups, to spit on
                        the lower downs, to get something for nothing, the greatest reverence being
                        offered to the one who has the most and serves the least - the ideals of the
                        dog in the manger. Achievement loses its meaning and stagnation takes its
                        place.</p>
                    <p>A foreigner is a person to be feared, to be hated, to be despised. In the
                        eyes of the law he has no rights, either to collect debts due him nor to sue
                        for libel. But he can be sued for libel whether he says anything or nothing
                        since speaking the truth is considered quite as libelous as speaking
                        falsely. A foreigner is one whose honesty, intelligence, industry are things
                        to be deadened as establishing bases of comparison threatening established
                        methods of muddling and monopoly. The whole community unites to hound, to
                        cheat, to defame the foreigner wheresoever he may come from. These methods
                        are common to business, professions and unions.</p>
                    <p>The classes divide simply according to self interest. Each class is filled
                        with hatred of the other especially the "liberals" who speak with the
                        greatest venom of the "lower class" and who can't get away from the subject.
                        From their point of view the laborer is not a human being but a creature
                        with no rights, created solely to work for the upper class and who should be
                        forced to serve his superior class by whatever means are necessary,
                        starvation being the favorite. If they can't be forced to work, as is the
                        case with the aboriginals, then poison them. Privilege is divine and anyone
                        attempting to tamper with it is a traitor. The upper class consequently does
                        not pay its bills. This is not considered dishonest. It is one of their
                        privileges always to be in arrears. It accords with the ideal of getting
                        something for nothing. To work for money as they do in the U.S. so</p>
                    <pb n="310"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 310 ====]</p>
                    <p>as to be able to pay your bills is degrading - "so materialistic." </p>
                    <p>"Government" is a supreme divine thing which when once determined, by no
                        matter what means, has a right to do whatever it divinely - or devilishly -
                        pleases. If at any time it happens that a certain group of "subjects," for
                        there is no such a thing as a citizen, attempts to urge its
                        "representative," it's a scandalous thing talked about ad nauseam in the
                        papers and the community generally and no "self respecting" member will pay
                        the slightest attention to the wishes of these constituents - nor do they
                        even in the matters on the platform, for of course a supreme power cannot be
                        bound by platform statements which are merely used as dust in the eyes. The
                        human creature will talk so give him a platform to talk about if he is a
                        laborer. The Liberals sleeping comfortably, don't require any platform. They
                        merely squirm with disgust when the Laborites talk about theirs.</p>
                    <p>The Civil Servant is the instrument by which Royalty maintains itself and its
                        powers and vice versa. It is a perfect instrument for its purpose and a
                        Civil Servant doesn't hesitate to tell parliament, as
                        <note>Lieutenant</note> Colonel <note>Percy Thomas</note> Owen did - "I was
                        chosen by the "Executive Council" - the direct agent of the King -
                        "therefore my powers transcend those of Parliament" - (chosen merely by the
                        people) - "and I shall not allow any act of Parliament to interfere with my
                        doing as I see fit." Their rewards for flaunting <note>flouting?</note> the
                        people and their agents are power and titles and promotions. The more brazen
                        they are the greater the reward. And no one not even a laborite would dream
                        of lessening the power of the Civil Service. Indeed the whole effort of all
                        parties is to increase the strength of this despotic organization. The whole
                        community believes in despotism. The idea of democracy is beyond the reach
                        of the imagination. They have heard the word but it has no meaning. The
                        Bureaucracy strangles the community. Heavy debts are forced on them,
                        education is perverted and prevented. Out of a class of 40 or 50 children
                        only 5 or 6 will be allowed to pass the examinations and so be able to take
                        higher education. On the boat on which I was</p>

                    <p>returning from India in 1938 was the wife of the <hi rend="ul">Londoner</hi>
                        who had been made the head of the Police Department of <hi rend="ul"

                            the N-YHS copy.</note> She was joining him there. I read in the
                        newspaper today - in the year 1945 - that England is arranging to <hi
                            rend="ul">permit</hi> a few "lower class" young folks to go to the
                        higher schools. This is called democracy in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Australia is under the absolute domination of an established bureaucracy
                        which controls not only major but even petty affairs of its citizens. Under
                        its sway talent can't develop. It permeates all fields from the lad who
                        enters a factory to the professional man. The former finds that if he works
                        efficiently he has put himself wrong with the supervisor and that no
                        promotions will come his way and that he will be one of the first to lose
                        his job when slack times come. A good example is a certain youth we know who
                        was a real mechanical genius. He had made a beautiful full sized motor boat
                        as perfect in its woodwork as any that comes from the shops. The only part
                        he had to buy was the engine. He got a job in a manufacturing establishment
                        and, having the habit of work, worked well turning out considerably more
                        than his fellow workers. This promptly put him in bad with the foreman who
                        presently made life unendurable for him and he is now working on a farm. So
                        this young man's particular abilities are lost to the community. This was
                        Unions. Yes, but a reflection of uppers.</p>
                    <p>The architect, for instance, discovers that to design is impossible, that
                        specifications for buildings laid down in ancient times are required, with a
                        few supplements such as requiring window sills 2'6" from the floor. Early in
                        his practice in Melbourne Griffin designed an office building - the Leonard
                        Chambers - for which he made drawings, at much cost to the office of course,
                        over and over for two solid years and which he finally threw back
                        practically as they were in the beginning and the Council passed them.
                        Probably they got tired of seeing "the damned Yankee" around. The building
                        had no window sills for its whole front, between its two outside piers was
                        glass in pattern with steel bars from the first floor to the top floor. When</p>
                    <pb n="312"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 312 ====]</p>
                    <p>it was completed the architects stood around and gasped with astonishment.
                        "How could he do that? It's against the law!" They had been cured of the
                        impulse to design by the squelching of any such pernicious efforts in their
                        early youth.</p>
                    <p>Within officialdom the pressure is still greater. A lad came to us from a
                        government office because his moral nature had not yet been broken down and
                        his parents did not exert the usual domination over him to hold onto a life
                        job. He had a permanent job with a raise of salary at certain fixed periods
                        of his life if he played the game but he didn't enjoy being obliged <hi
                            rend="ul">not</hi> to work. It didn't take him long to learn that if he
                        had finished the task given him by his superior officer he had only annoyed
                        him if he told him he was ready for the next. If he wanted to keep in his
                        good graces he must, when the supervisor came around, push his pencil around
                        and look busy. Only so can a Civil Servant attain those positions which
                        bring them honor and glory, though of course if they outlive all their
                        contemporaries they will come into them through pure priority.</p>
                    <p>While I was in America I, like all the pious people, was working for Civil
                        Service reform. It took but a short experience under a perfected officialdom
                        to realize the folly of such a movement. It is however one of those things
                        that really cannot be grasped by the rational method of thinking. It is so
                        reasonable, so subtly appealing. It can be comprehended only through
                        experience or through creative, inspirational thinking through which we can
                        perceive that this mixing of the economic with the political can end only in
                        dictatorship which ultimately can have no efficiency. We must realize
                        however that separation is no good if the political organ continues to grant
                        special privileges such as monopolies, ownership of land or tolerance of

                        Australia I followed a story then unfolding,</p>

                    <p>with intense interest. Who else, I wonder, saw that tale unfold? In the very
                        early days of the 1st World War I noticed a small paragraph in an obscure
                        part of the paper saying that President Duschanel <note>Paul Deschanel?;
                            "Poincare" crossed out</note> (and we must remember that he had no such
                        authority as our Congressional President) had placarded the whole of France
                        with an appeal to the people to support the Parliament as against the
                        Military Bureaucracy, saying that Parliament and the President were the
                        executives selected by the people and it was not possible for them to
                        function in this capacity unless they were informed as to facts and the
                        Military department was refusing to supply them with facts. He recognized
                        the objection of placing necessarily secret information in too many hands,
                        such as Parliament or even the Cabinet. But this objection could not hold in
                        the case of the President. He stated that in the early days the French
                        soldiers at the front would have starved, such were the delays through the
                        red tape of officialdom, if Parliament hadn't taken into its own hands the
                        forwarding of provisions.</p>
                    <p>Weeks, sometimes years elapsed in my gathering of information on the sequence
                        of events. The generalissimo of the army refused to give this information
                        and was dismissed by the President. Each general asked refused to accept the
                        conditions. Ultimately Duschanel <note>Deschanel?; "Poincare" crossed
                        out</note> called upon a general in the Saar district where both Germans and
                        French saw to it that there should be no fighting for without those supplies
                        the war couldn't continue, and General <note>Ferdinand</note> Foch accepted
                        the position as head of the French Army. He was a Catholic. Now I am not a
                        Catholic. For a long time I was very anti-Catholic. Australia cured me of
                        that. The bureaucracies are Masonic. When Generalissimo Foch issued his
                        instructions no general obeyed them. The movements of the Allied armies
                        stopped, British as well as French. The Germans were welcome to walk into
                        Paris if they wanted to so far as the Allied armies were concerned, but
                        curiously enough the German activities ceased too (Bureaucrats of course).
                        From a high officer in the Australian army who was there we learned
                        personally that there was no battle and defeat at Amiens (if</p>

                        front, the subordinate officers followed them and the soldiers, seeing them
                        going, followed after. From an article in the Saturday Evening Post after
                        the war I read that, having volunteered in the early days, an American
                        Aviator - and other aviators in Northern France all ready to go to the front
                        and knowing the urgency of the situation could not conceive why they were
                        not sent forward. Finally they were sent and they saw this, to them, still
                        incomprehensible thing, happening. There were three orderly lines of march;
                        no fear, no excitement. Two were coming away from the front, one marching
                        in. Those coming out were the people of the district carrying their goods;
                        and the soldiers. The one going in was the last reserves of France, the old
                        men. They were the only ones who responded to Foch's appeal to save France.</p>
                    <p>Having found a group who would take his orders Duschanel
                        <note>Deschanel?</note> court-marshaled several generals for disobeying the
                        orders of their superior and the battle was on again. The British officers
                        were never punished though Roberts was recalled to England, Gish was
                        rewarded later by being given charge of the Army in Russia fighting the
                        revolutionists. Some time after the war was over <note>Georges</note>
                        Clemenceau was entertained in London by the higher-ups, official and
                        otherwise, who were astounded and looked at him with incredulous amazement
                        when he said that the President of France had selected the General of the
                        military forces (a defiance of Parliamentary, that is of bureaucratic
                        procedure).</p>
                    <p>We arrived in Australia in May, 1914. Six months before Mr. James Alexander
                        Smith, a great man and a renowned engineer, had advised Griffin against
                        coming to Australia. He had told him that a war would break out in Europe in
                        1914. He was like Mr. Henry Stead <note>Henry Wickham Steed?</note>, the
                        greatest editor of those years, who also foretold - out of his knowledge of
                        underlying things - practically everything that happened during the war even
                        to the failure of President <note>Woodrow</note> Wilson at Versailles. We,
                        ourselves, wept tears of anguish when President Wilson yielded to the
                        pressure for secret conferences knowing that meant the end of his power and
                        influence.</p>

                    <p>Leeton already had a small population when Griffin first arrived in
                        Australia. Mr. Wade <note>L.A.B. Wade?</note>, whose death shortly after was
                        a great loss to Australia, put the planning of this hillsite in Griffin's
                        hands and had him design a crown feature for the water tower already under
                        construction. Griffin advised and Mr. Wade agreed to making this one of an
                        ultimate pair to form a gateway to the Central Plaza of the city. He made
                        the drawings for this on shipboard and sent it back when he landed in
                        America. Mr. Wade's death was WBG's first heartbreak in Australia.</p>

                        direction (Commissioner) with wide latitude of regulation based on
                        socialized land and socialized public street services, together with an
                        ethic and hygienic authority considerably wider than police power as
                        ordinarily construed. To encourage continuity there is provided in the
                        organization, antecedent to the usual function of the City Surveyor, a
                        permanent Landscape Gardener to bring to bear on the continual development

                        Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and starts with inexpensive land occupying a
                        definitely limited site, non-irrigable because slightly elevated, but for
                        the same reason easily drained and commanding the breezes as well as the
                        views.</p>
                    <p>This low-lying elongated hill extends in a north-north-easterly
                        south-south-westerly direction for a length of two miles with its highest
                        and broadest portion at the northern end gently rising from a level plain to
                        60' elevation and with two off-shoots of just perceptible rise - one
                        extending for a mile to the south and one for a quarter of a mile westward.

                    </p>
                    <p>Of the whole town site 40 percent is allotted to private purposes and 40 per
                        cent to communal purposes:- Public buildings, parks, etc., exclusive of the
                        general communication ways.</p>
                    <p>The general lie of the hill facilitates an ideal orientation for the major
                        portion of the town with angles of thirty and sixty degrees about the
                        meridian assuring all sunlit frontages, maintaining however a preponderance
                        of shade on one side or the other of each street at the hottest period of
                        the day.</p>
                    <p>In a community of the size of Leeton where the domestic character
                        predominates the limitations and simplicity of the whole organization permit
                        considerable freedom and informality for a homely coziness and
                        picturesqueness. Flexibility and convertibility in a small place are but
                        minor requirements. Great care has been taken however to avoid confusion or
                        monotony in the cumulative effect by definite subordination of the numerous
                        elements to the few important ones and by restricting the variation of
                        orientation to a very few fixed directions. The intersections between
                        various building groups of diverse directions are concealed or mitigated by
                        special measures in parking or court group arrangements with only obtuse
                        angles in evidence.</p>

                    <p>The retail shopping industry may be expected to continue to serve largely a
                        constituency outside the town (an area of intensive culture in small
                        irrigated farms) requiring therefore a maximum of accessibility by rail and
                        external roads. The shops comprising essentially an aggregation of private
                        enterprises in small units are arranged to be defined so far as possible by
                        larger units of nearest analogous use to serve as terminals of the grouping
                        for effective architectural composition.</p>
                    <note>In the New-York Historical Society copy the illustration "Central Plaza of
                        Leeton" appears on a separate page at this point.</note>
                    <p>Railway passenger and goods stations confine thus the extension on
                        <note>the</note> west. Two public garages, convenient to the greatest
                        highway traffic at the east, are given a rather exceptional degree of public
                        control in order, eventually, to effect a strong "gateway" impression with
                        their severely plain masses free of awnings.</p>
                    <p>The most general and largest unit of merchandising, The Town Market, is
                        availed of for the central dominant element coupled with a combined store
                        and office building in the other protruding southern corner in the trade
                        route to complete this strong structural frame for more or less
                        heterogeneous minor commercial buildings.</p>

                        Stock Yards, and for Feed Fuel and Building Materials is made contributory
                        to the Mercantile thoroughfare as well as the Railway, at the same time
                        lying beyond the stations, shut off by special screening parkways and
                        removed from the other activities of the town by the intervening railway
                        right of way. For noonday use especially this flat district is furnished
                        with a local sports field and picnic park. Additional factory space also
                        facing this park and screened and served in exactly the same way as the one
                        provided can be established on the other side <note>of</note> the crossing

                    <p>The administrative phase of business as compared with handling and
                        manipulating merchandise requires a somewhat different degree and kind of
                        traffic accommodation, the heavy traffic being relatively a minor element in
                        the case of the former though easy accessibility is equally imperative. The
                        central square of the town is here arranged to accommodate the Post Office,
                        Banks, Town Hall, Court House and buildings for private offices adjoining
                        the Mercantile Axis to which it is a transverse axis providing amenities not

                        of the hill serve at the same time to stop and define the upper ends of the
                        miscellaneous mercantile group on the northern side of the commercial
                        highway in a way corresponding with the most important of the business

                        with sheltering plantings and open fields is ample to allow the visiting

                        of Ancient Greece.</p>
                    <p>The contiguous location of the show grounds for the exhibits of stock,
                        produce and agricultural and horticultural facilities makes it possible to

                    <p>Spanish Towns may be revived here where the environment a well as the
                        temperament of the people are as well suited. The northern end of this
                        esplanade which is the actual summit of Leeton Hill is to be marked by two
                        concrete water towers, plain masses 70 feet high, crested with perforated
                        enrichment. One of these is completed and its twin is arranged to combine
                        with it as a high portal giving on to the Town Square. Between these massive
                        gate posts a glimpse of a facade of a church at the bend of the approach

                    <p>Facing the plaza is the State Hotel, the sole place where liquors are
                        dispensed or served for drinking, and with meals only. This policy will
                        naturally induce private hostelries and accommodation houses to be
                        contiguous, establishing as it were a transients' centre. Here then is the
                        strategic location for theatres, clubs and lodges for which general purpose
                        the main esplanade frontage is reserved and is to be restricted to an
                        harmonious arrangement; preferably fully carried out by the authorities.</p>
                    <p>Adjoining the central square an existent quarry on the brow of the hill, with
                        view of the distant blue ranges to the north east offers a chance to create
                        inexpensively a picturesque general park or natural history garden of 4
                        acres to be treated informally and to simulate wild nature with profusion of
                        varied flora and native fauna. At least one local school and one club house
                        are to be assured frontage on this choice spot.</p>

                        accommodate a large variety of games and exercises with a minimum of

                        neighborhoods where the large general parks are least available and where
                        the gentler slopes obviate expense in constructing fields for sports.</p>

                    <p>The community requires one general educational institution at the least,
                        namely, the academy or high school where the general secondary and the lower
                        technical, particularly domestic and agricultural sciences are taught.
                        Previously one reservation for the State School had been located which is
                        retained in the Extension and accorded a commanding position with reference
                        to one of the main avenues of approach to town. Adjoining it a site similar
                        in all respects is allotted to the Girls' School which is its complement and
                        may utilize much of a common staff and equipment. Another Institute or
                        educational building for reference purposes and adult use, terminating the
                        avenue leading into the main square and allowing for future incorporation of
                        Library, Museums, Art Collections, etc., completes the dominant features of
                        a General Educational Centre, which contributes directly - architecturally

                    <p>A community of ultimately fifteen hundred families can economically be
                        supplied with from five to eight school districts, the smaller divisions
                        being advantageous in handiness to the homes. The sites indicated are evenly
                        distributed and the lines of segregation are the main avenues so that the
                        paths of the children may be clear and safe. Each site of course requires a
                        large playground area which is cheaply furnished by the largest of the local
                        internal parks. Points giving on to these parks and also commanding
                        approaching streets for accessibility and architectural interest are given
                        the preference and there are many such sites that may be added to those so

                        especially to be conserved to the fullest because they usually contribute
                        the richest and most effective features to the local architectural ensemble.

                    <p>Mr. <note>L.A.B.?</note> Wade, whose death a year later broke our hearts,
                        made contact with Griffin on that first visit to Australia. The occupation
                        of this irrigation location had already begun and a water tower was partly
                        built. Mr. Wade asked Griffin to design the city and showed him the water
                        tower. Griffin suggested that there should ultimately be a pair of towers as
                        a formal gateway to the city.</p>
                    <p>Griffin made the drawings for the crown of the towers on shipboard and sent

                    <p>It is to be hoped that the general character of Leeton may be distinguished
                        ultimately by a preponderance of shrub plantings naturally and informally
                        massed and grouped for harmonies of texture and color of foliage and flower.
                        The native flora, almost exclusively ligneous, indicated the line of least
                        resistance under conditions of strong sunlight and irregular moisture as
                        compared with the countries whence our habits of great lawns and herbaceous
                        borders are inherited. The unambiguous scale of Leeton suggested the general
                        informal arrangement which can only be brought out in execution by
                        thoughtful avoidance of hardness or stiffness in the general landscape

                        road leading south from the east side directly to Yanco; the railway to be
                        built correspondingly on the west side will largely supersede this in
                        activity. Interurban tram lines radiating into the irrigated fields may also
                        be expected to pass through here ultimately. The railway line is made to
                        intersect the hill slopes twice in the short length that is in contact with
                        the Town Site, to afford cheapest overhead continuity of the entrance

                    <p>The United States has the soundest basis for democracy that the world has
                        known and we owe it to the great geniuses who conceived it to pass the word
                        along.</p>
                    <p>A democracy defined:- It is a community whose political function is to
                        maintain EQUITY (which is not identical with equality), whose standard of
                        equity is determined by the majority of its citizens and which is equipped
                        with power to safeguard minorities in the exercise of their rights of life,
                        of liberty of thought and the development of their abilities, and of access
                        to nature.</p>
                    <p>A quarter of a century of adult life under the Congressional rule and another
                        quarter of a century under Parliamentary government have revealed to me
                        personally what was called to my attention by an article in one of the
                        American monthlies shortly before Griffin was called to Australia in 1914 as
                        Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction of Canberra. That
                        article spoke of Parliamentary government as the most successful smoke
                        screen ever devised for concealing the fact that the complete control of
                        affairs was in the hands of the Powers that be as versus the People. This is
                        implemented by a perfected Civil Service from which America was fortunately
                        rescued by <note>President</note> Andrew Jackson. It is better to have the
                        Service in the bag of the politicians than to have the politicians in the
                        bag of the bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>It is not only that the officials have the spending of the funds and so can
                        delay indefinitely whatever they object to, as this article stated, but that
                        in a system of more or less indefinite tenure a party in power can always be
                        thrown out by the officials by a manipulation of the votes of the Members.
                        The ways and means are subtle and so the people mystified (really by
                        threatening loss of jobs of Members' relatives placed on temporary rolls). I
                        have found in my speaking of this matter only one person who was fully
                        conscious of the futility of voting. It was an Australian to whom I was
                        speaking. She said, "Oh, I know. I can't</p>

                        into the booth and just write on the voting paper — "Have it your own way,
                        dearie."</p>
                    <p><note>Eamon</note> De Valera knew this when treating with England after the
                        last war but Congressional government had to be cancelled out of his plans
                        when terms were arranged for a new deal for Ireland. The unique conditions
                        there have altered the usual methods but the conditions are not wholesome,
                        not democratic.</p>
                    <p>In Parliamentary government the Executive is not determined by the people —
                        only the Members. The leader of the Party may or may not become the Prime
                        Minister. For instance at the beginning of the First world war — who made
                            <note>David</note> Lloyd George Prime Minister instead of
                        <note>Herbert</note> Asquith or, in Australia, William Hughes instead of Mr.
                            <note>Andrew</note> Fisher? Not the people. Nor do the people decide
                        when an Executive's term shall end or a party be thrown out of power though
                        they are supposed to be elected for a particular length of time. It is
                        determined by a manipulation of the votes in Parliament behind the scenes by
                        the powers of the officialdom. The same with the extension of term of
                        office. The officials have all the favors to grant. They can appoint
                        temporary officers and throw them out when they choose, brothers or cousins,
                        etc., of Members. Of course sometimes Members change their opinions and vote
                        against their party but it is not usually so, the case is utterly different
                        from the American where voting against one's party does not throw the party
                        out of power. One does not wish to put oneself out of a job. It is usually
                        pressure; seldom that a Member would vote his party out of control and
                        consequently have to go to the bother, time, expense and risk of a new
                        election.</p>
                    <p>In our experience there was a private citizen who was determined to have the
                        Federal Capital carried through successfully. He was one of those who got it
                        written into the constitution that the site for the Capital must be
                        determined within ten years. Of course, </p>

                    <p>in any country there may be a great man who will arise to force through some
                        great undertaking but this often means great struggles and even wars. Why
                        make it unnecessarily difficult? None of the influential ones wanted the
                        Capital to become a fact, not the Empire, not the States, not the officials
                        nor the business men. But Mr. James Alexander Smith pressed on. He persuaded
                        the Minister of Home Affairs, an Irishman, Mr. <note>King</note> O'Malley,
                        to put out conditions for an international competition which Griffin won.
                        For this, the Labor Party was thrown out of office.</p>
                    <p>This was about the time of the outbreak of the First World War. The Liberal
                        Party was now in power. There was an Associate Prime Minister. He was also
                        an Irishman, Mr. <note>W.H.</note> Kelley. Mr. J. A. Smith persuaded him to
                        invite Griffin to Australia. He did so and he was appointed Federal Capital
                        Director of Design and Construction. So then the Liberal Party was thrown
                        out of power. Since there are but two parties in Australia, it is not so
                        easy for the Bureaucracy as when there are several parties and specially in
                        Australia where the Labor Party has established the method of voting their
                        Ministers into office. Each member having ambitions would vote for himself
                        first then second for the one he considered the least likely to win. The
                        unanimity of opinion on this brought the "Wombat" <note>William Oliver
                            Archibald</note> into the post of Ministers of Home Affairs. He was very
                        subservient to the officialdom so it was a hard year for Griffin. But the
                        Party felt he was not a credit to them so they held another election among
                        the Members and O'Malley again came into the Home Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Now the war was on between Smith, O'Malley and Griffin on the one side and
                        the whole Bureaucracy on the other. Every possible obstruction, every delay,
                        for another year till finally an amazing thing happened. Great individuals
                        are not determined by race. Indeed it is now true that nothing can be found
                        that distinguishes one race from another. A great man may arise anywhere.
                        This was one of the</p>

                    <p>great Englishmen, Mr. <note>William</note> Webster, a member of the Cabinet,
                        who with the consent of Mr. O'Malley called for a Royal Commission which
                        after nine months of testimony condemned on all accounts the head officials
                        of the Home Affairs Department. Such a thing had happened only once before
                        in British history which goes to show that although nothing is impossible,
                        it is certainly wise to choose a form of government which does not make
                        things that are important to the people almost impossible.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the Prime Minister and the whole Cabinet are selected from the
                        Legislative body means that there is almost never anyone of <hi rend="ul"
                            >executive</hi> capacity or experience, which again makes them dependent
                        and subservient to the officials of their various departments. They have no
                        knowledge nor experience to enable them to hold out against official advice.</p>
                    <p>The Legislative temperament considers and reconsiders. The Executive
                        temperament decides and acts on his decisions. The head Executive must have
                        the <hi rend="ul">power to choose his assistants and to dismiss them</hi>,
                        otherwise he cannot be held responsible. This applies to his Cabinet and to
                        the officials. The remedy for complications should be met by limiting the
                        functions of the Political Organ, ultimately, to maintaining Equity.</p>
                    <p>There is much talk about "the democracies" but in fact there is, at least
                        among the considerable groups of humanity, but one democracy an organization
                        that has the maintenance of Equity written into its constitution and whose
                        people choose their Executive. That is the United States whose citizens in
                        consequence, though but one sixth of humanity, consume fifty percent of the
                        products of the world. In the other so-called democracies the people have no
                        power at all. They get very discouraged but don't know why.</p>
                    <p>If in the conferences to come America realizes the basic reason for her
                        uniqueness among the people of the world and insists on even</p>

                    <p>one thing — that Germany (and if possible the liberated countries, certainly
                        Italy) shall be reconstructed on the basis of a Congressional form of
                        government with the maintenance of Equity as its function, the example of a
                        peaceful and successful Germany might wake up the other countries to alter
                        their power controlled communities on the same lines. Then with a World
                        Economic Organization established there would be no wars for Economics is
                        based on <hi rend="ul">Mutual</hi> Advantage.</p>
                    <p>There are but two natural political divisions — the continent and the
                        municipality, the latter being really a business organization. The American
                        Senate is a hang-over. The power of the States as states is but serving to
                        move the United States backward from being the greatest free trade region in
                        the world to quarreling protective tariff districts. A second house but
                        causes confusion and delay and uncertainty. It is a hang-over from the
                        infancy of democracy when full confidence was lacking.</p>
                    <p>America should use her influence, not power, to bring about the Congressional
                        form of government in China and in every other part of the world. It is the
                        soundest basis for democracy that the world has known and we owe it to the
                        great geniuses who conceived it for us, to pass the word along.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>You might say that the one moment of pure romance in our lives was that
                        moment spent in Pholiota (the Mushroom) — pure romance focused for a moment
                        in the battle of a lifetime.</p>
                    <p>When we went to Australia they were still doing things as they did in the
                        time of Victoria.</p>
                    <p>HOW WE SAW THE HEAD OF THE RIVER RACE<lb/> by Lillian Hamilton Moore,
                        Lyndhurst Crescent, Auburn<lb/> The boat race on the Yarra, Melbourne</p>
                    <p>The day is over and all the sections of the community that I come across are
                        pleased. I wore different colors for myself but except for a momentary
                        disappointment felt pleased. The best crew won and good sports got the cup.
                        We went early to pick our places. At 12:30 we owned the river. The East side
                        of the Judge's box we argued was the best. By standing on the edge of the
                        embankment we could get a good view of the approaching boats and decide the
                        finish with the judge, as it were. Having settled this we had our lunch.
                        There were thirteen of us — no doubt that was the mistake. The day was
                        glorious, warm sunshine and no wind. The lunch was a great success; a man
                        snapped us "The First Comers." A little after one o'clock two or three
                        people came along so we got into position. We spread out the rug corner-wise
                        and sat in a row, feet dangling; another two had a cushion and one of the
                        party sat on a little camp stool. Father and the little boys went off to get
                        a boat we had engaged. Everything possible was done to make the day a
                        success. We, the women folk, preferred to sit where we were; it would be
                        more "fun" and our country cousins and the friends from America would enjoy
                        the boys' corner.</p>
                    <p>Right up to 2:30 we congratulated ourselves upon our maneuvers, but presently
                        the "camper" had to decamp to the lower level, she not being strong and the
                        crowd beginning to press. She took up her seat and stood below. Another two
                        minutes and we others decided to stand for fear our backs might get broken
                        and we got up one at a time to</p>
                    <pb n="339"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 339 ====]</p>
                    <p>maintain our positions, because by this time there was a great press and we
                        guessed there was a crowd behind. We got up and saw and then we knew we were
                        in for it. Our folks came over from Scotland in the early days and stuck,
                        and we had it in us. The country cousin was pushed down the embankment
                        twice. She rolled right over but came up again smiling and brave. But it was
                        all right till I was suddenly pulled back and a burley form twisted me about
                        and got in front. It was a policeman, and all at once there were six of
                        them. The first one who was now in front of me doubled his body and butted
                        into me. I felt myself falling and clutched something. It was another
                        policeman who threw off my hands and shouted, "Don't you hold on to me, move
                        back. Don't push — her Excellency is here." It was all over in a moment — I
                        mean the parting up with our stand. Our party was pushed back into the
                        swaying, seething mass. To and fro, backwards and forwards, up and down we
                        swayed and ran. Policemen backed and shouted and boys pushed forward. Never
                        did I know anything like it. Once I saw my husband and the little boys
                        looking anxiously our way and I wished I had not been chosen to be right in
                        the "fun." My hat was ruined, my coat torn, colors gone, best boots beyond
                        description. Then their Excellencies were got into a boat (not having six
                        policemen to guide us we could not get into ours) and things eased a moment.
                        My fight was over though and I fell back and the boats came in and I didn't
                        see. Arrived at 12:30 and didn't see.</p>
                    <p>Now being a sport though 40 (odd) I didn't mind. "All in the day," but I
                        would like to suggest that some other arrangements be made for the policemen
                        next time. No one would mind Their Excellencies' having the best place, and
                        we would not ask them to picnic at 12:30 to get it, but couldn't an
                        enclosure be made in readiness? A railing say 4 feet square would perhaps
                        suffice. Everyone would respect this and be pleased to welcome the occupants
                        at the last minute. I try to</p>

                        were booked and no policeman to butt. — The early bird that didn't catch the

                    <p>Anyway Walt decided it was time he investigated the Yarra. At about 12
                        o'clock we started off for our jaunt. We took a train to a slight distance
                        out of Melbourne, got a boat, and of course there was no stopping Walter
                        till we had rowed 26 miles, 13 up against the swift current of the Yarra
                        River and 13 back getting back after 10 and finding the boat-house people
                        quite perturbed for fear something had happened to us. They do not know
                        Walter but they did know he was the Federal Capital Director and apparently
                        could not be classed among our "favorites" who would have been glad to have
                        his career brought to an end by any means the Lord might provide.</p>
                    <p>Of course he decided on all the locations for dams to hold the waters of a
                        series of lakes to take the place of the swamp reaches the rains bring to
                        large districts making them completely useless. It would make a wonderful
                        park system for Melbourne and outlying municipalities. One such lake would
                        be at the foot of Mt. Eagle Estate the laying out of which was one of his
                        early jobs over here and where his sister's home and our Doll House were
                        built.</p>
                    <p>This Mount Eagle district had been a sort of Mecca for the artists of
                        Australia who for years had holidayed and sketched here-abouts. This whole
                        river bottom, impossible for occupation should be made into a park system —
                        a lovely outing place for all of the lesser and greater municipalities.</p>
                    <p>MOUNT EAGLE ESTATE</p>
                    <p>In Heidelberg, Victoria, we had the universal experience for</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 342 ====]</p>
                    <p>everywhere in Australia too was the gridiron plan being imposed no matter
                        what the nature of the landscape. Griffin had been prepared for what Town
                        Planning was up against by his experience with the Fairy Harbor Estate on
                        the coast of Manly — steep bluffs, craggy rocks, for which impossible roads,
                        gradients no auto could master, had been determined upon by the conventional
                        subdivider. The client brought his problem to Griffin who suggested the sort
                        of thing he later accomplished in Castlecrag. But before a municipal council
                        would pass a subdivision it had to be okayed by a licensed surveyor and no
                        surveyor would stamp with his approval what, though it conformed to the laws
                        of nature and the needs of men, defied the established custom of the empire.
                        There is a sort of lese majesty in doing something so different. So that
                        lovely bit was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Prepared by this experience Griffin used new tactics. He laid out the streets
                        on easy gradients with provision for interior and River Bank parks
                        calculating all the streets and allotments and paid the surveyors as if they
                        had done the work.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="ul">PHOLIOTA</hi><lb/> The mushroom sprang up in the night.</p>
                    <p>When Griffin, always an adventurer, finally succumbed to the homing instinct
                        which he had tried for so many years to break down in his wife, we started
                        to build the doll house on the second lot within the same enclosure as his
                        sister's home on the Mount Eagle estate which he had laid out several years
                        before in Heidelberg, a municipality some 14 miles from Melbourne. He took
                        for granted that no municipal council in the British Empire (patterned on
                        the Roman Empire down to the details of specifications of buildings) would
                        pass the design he was contemplating. So as doll house it was passed by the
                        Council and him and me and a chicken farmer built it — the cheapest, the
                        most perfect and charming home in the empire. In those first years in
                        Melbourne where they had no good building stone, sending</p>
                    <pb n="343"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 343 ====]</p>
                    <p>to Sydney for the stone for important buildings; and where the bricks as
                        everywhere in Australia were ugly in size, shape, texture and color, he
                        invented a new type of construction, an interlocking, concrete tile, the
                        last word in economy for permanent fireproof residential construction. The
                        structural columns consist of two or four interlocking quadrants spaced on
                        units based on the width required for openings, giving a charming fluted
                        exterior wall and round corners in the interior. The walls between are two
                        and a quarter inches thick with hollow space in which a coating of bitumen
                        or Aquella can be placed. The tiles are one foot square and are staggered
                        horizontally and vertically so there are no through joints. The hollow space
                        between is enough for warmth and sound proofing. The economy in the
                        thickness of the walls gives the space of an extra bed room in an ordinary
                        two bed room house so that in a house covering the same area one gets three
                        bed rooms instead of two.</p>
                    <p>The surfacing of the tiles can be of different colored sands used while
                        manufacturing them so that the house looks like cut stone and in the
                        sunshine like marble; and in the interior there is no need for plaster nor
                        for decoration though many rich and varied color effects can be obtained by
                        staining the tiles to pattern or otherwise. Thus the knitlock construction
                        undercuts the cost of the cheapest brick buildings, and makes windows as
                        cheap as walls since the tile as laid up form finished sills, heads and
                        jambs so far as the masonry is concerned. Griffin had not yet worked out the
                        knitlock roof tiles when Pholiota was built.</p>
                    <p>So here in the suburb of Heidelberg on the bank of the Yarra River we built
                        this first home of our own, we two doing most of the erection of the walls
                        which was like building with children's building blocks for no mortar is
                        required, the farmer coming along when the chickens would let him. We
                        ourselves were lucky if we got an occasional week end free, but in a very
                        short time we had the</p>

                    <p>cheapest and the most perfect fireproof home in any city anywhere. Like any
                        home it was designed to meet our personal requirements. The floor was brick
                        laid solid on the ground, so cool in summer and warm in winter.</p>
                    <p>Father and Mother Griffin were visiting the Lippincotts when the time came
                        for the windows. For the time of their visit we were all living together
                        with sister Genevieve's family. One day I saw father prowling around and
                        talking something over with the carpenter farmer and, listening in, I found
                        they had decided that the windows wouldn't work. Of course it was another
                        invention of W.B.G.'s, a pivoted window which wouldn't slam in the wind,
                        with the simplest device in the world for opening and shutting without
                        opening the screen. Of course our very elegant father didn't at all like to
                        see his distinguished son doing day labor and on a house which was to become
                        a one room home, and he was equally disgruntled by having a tom-boy
                        daughter-in-law who delighted in taking part in such rough work.</p>
                    <p>Then son-in-law Roy came home — he also an architect — and there was another
                        consultation re the windows which the farmer had discontinued installing,
                        and I heard them say — "Of course it won't work." The pivot was some four
                        inches from the window jamb so you see of course it wouldn't work. I
                        secretly reported this conference to my senor <note>Walter Burley
                        Griffin</note> who disgustedly said, "Of course it will work," and out he
                        went and put in a window. Of course it worked. Nobody said anything to
                        anybody, but I kept an eye on the house and presently saw father go out and
                        look and try. It opened!! And later on I saw Roy go out. Same answer. Nobody
                        said anything to anybody.</p>
                    <p>Soon it was finished. The house had been put to the Council as a doll house
                        (for the little ones for it was in the same yard, a fenced enclosure, as
                        theirs) and so it was for it was never locked and Aunt and Uncle were
                        usually gone early in the morning, and homing</p>

                    <p>hours were often late, and the children could take possession during the day
                        so long as they promised not to eat the sugar. But our home it was and no
                        one ever had a more perfect house. In the two years we were there before we
                        had to go up to Sydney. I am sure we entertained more people than anyone in
                        Australia except perhaps the Governor General. Everyone wanted to see it and
                        everyone had to show it to their friends. So they found entertainment there
                        whether we were at home or not. On our return we might find embers still hot
                        in the fireplace, or a bead from a dress on the floor, or a jar of jam on
                        the table.</p>
                    <p>We always taught the young people in the office that they must never be
                        satisfied with anything short of perfection, the correct answer. They all
                        came to Pholiota for a Christmas party, the young folks supplying the
                        eatables. Everyone brought sweets! Such a party! One of our head draftsmen
                        told me he had never been able to comprehend what I meant by saying even the
                        least thing must be perfect, but now he understood. Here this, one might
                        say, costless house and furniture was perfect. The most conservative man I
                        ever know, whose wife and children wanted us to build a house for them, was
                        finally persuaded by his son to come out and see us. He wandered about the
                        little home, twenty-one feet square all told, smiling and laughing, and
                        finally said — "It's too pretty to use." Practically it was perfect too a
                        place for everything and everything just naturally dropping into its place.
                        In Pholiota the interior tiles were subdivided by a groove into six inch
                        squares which were colored alternately gold and henna.</p>
                    <p>The room was a cross within a square which when the burlap curtains were
                        extended (from the corners where they usually hung screening the specialized
                        corners) to screen the two divan alcoves or sleeping quarters, became an
                        interior fourteen foot square plus a five by seven piano alcove on one sided
                        and a fire place alcove on the other</p>
                    <pb n="347"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 347 ====]</p>
                    <p>side, a circular table in the center which could always accommodate anyone
                        else who came in during a meal by the simple device of each one's pushing
                        back his chair and so increasing the circumference. Over it hung, from the
                        peak of the sloped ceiling, a beautiful fretwork plaster lantern designed
                        for and stolen from the Palais de Dance. By thus drawing the curtains the
                        two alcoves became two private bed rooms. The four corners usually partly
                        screened from the center, each seven by seven, were the entrance and
                        library; the dressing room with its two dressing tables with a window beside
                        each and hanging space; the bathroom arrangements; and the kitchen from
                        which the hostess, if by chance domestic duties compelled her, could always
                        enter into conversation and arguments taking place in other parts of the
                        room. This was the sine-qua-non for a home for Mrs. W.B.G.</p>
                    <p>Well presently some man was called to book by the municipal council for not
                        having complied with the municipal requirements. Such perpetual petty
                        dictatorship in all details of life! No wonder the spirit of the European
                        peoples is so completely broken. And venom being a natural result of
                        frustration this gent reported to the council that the Griffins were living
                        in the doll house. This came near resulting in an international scandal. We
                        were promptly ordered to bring our house into conformity. Now as it happened
                        our house met all their requirements but not in their way. It was larger but
                        it did not have three separate rooms, its average height was greater but its
                        minimum height was less than 9 feet, it had enormously more ventilation but
                        it didn't have dinky little ventilators in the wall above the window height.
                        There was no wall above the windows. The kitchen was compact and completely
                        equipped but that kitchen corner wasn't the required area. There was no
                        possible way of making the house conform except by tearing it down and
                        building it over again, making it ugly in proportions, impossible for
                        entertainment, wasteful of space, etc., etc.</p>

                    <p>on the part of the Director of Design and Construction of the Federal
                        Capital, we received a notification that if the house were not made to
                        conform in two weeks they would proceed to pull it down. Whereupon Mrs. G.
                        said to Mr. G. — "Well let them pull it down and we'll live in a canvas bag
                        (as we had done in our canoe trips and which in fact would not have been
                        against the law) and cook our meals over a bonfire. We own this lot. We'll
                        see what they do about that." And there it stood. We concerned ourselves no
                        more about it though we know that a townsman had recently been evicted from
                        his home. He was a builder who had taken on a contract for a house and
                        forgotten to include the cost of the roof. The client refused to pay for the
                        roof so he was left without enough money to carry on the construction of his
                        own house. The whole of his house was framed and roofed and most of the
                        exterior walls completed but only the kitchen, dining room and bath
                        completely finished, the rest like an open veranda which in that climate is
                        perfectly comfortable to sleep on, which a large part of the people do the
                        year around. But it didn't conform to the requirements so he and his wife
                        were thrown out onto the street. Such is government in the economic realm.
                        When will we wake up to the fact that a human community needs three complete
                        organizations to fulfill the three necessities of human beings in a
                        community.</p>
                    <p>One day our neighbor brought a guest of theirs in to see us. We had a
                        pleasant hour together. That's the trouble, these imperialists are so
                        pleasant one can't believe their system is the last word of ingenuity of
                        Satan himself. However nothing fatal happened. We found out later that this
                        gentleman was the State Architect who had been called upon by the Council
                        and who had advised the Council, under the circumstances, to call it an
                        experimental house and drop the matter, which they did.</p>

                    <p>discomfort comes not only from the cold during the four months of winter when
                        the whole community, rich and poor, suffer intense discomfort in the houses,
                        but frequently during other seasons. With one voice all who come from other
                        climates say they have never suffered with the cold in their lives as they
                        do in Australia. The solution to this, removing all the discomfort of the
                        climate is the simple device used by the aboriginals — to take advantage of
                        the much lesser range of temperature of the ground, at least 20 degrees less
                        than that of the air. This is practically all that is needed in this
                        wonderful climate to make living comfortable summer or winter. With doors
                        and windows closed on nippy days and a solid floor the warmth of the earth
                        comes up and fills the whole house and on coldest days a bit of a fire in
                        the fireplace with the warm floor and the whole house is all right. Such a
                        little thing and a whole civilization can be transformed, but do you suppose
                        a Municipal Council would permit it? By no means. Our brick floor met the
                        issue in Pholiota. Of course we had rugs as well, the aesthetic helping out
                        the practical.</p>
                    <p>Interiors are things unknown to practicing architects because their training
                        in the universities is from pictures and you really can't photograph
                        interiors. Anyway their training consists only in the study of individual
                        expensive buildings. In other fields how could the poor dears make a living.
                        So we moderns live in packing boxes and the genius of our children dies from
                        starvation in their early years. The story of a friend's child is typical.
                        She was sent to a music teacher to learn music. She wept all the time she
                        was there. When afterward her mother asked her why she didn't sing she said
                        she couldn't, it was so ugly — the room.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to the general idea of our intelligentsia, the residences are the
                        most important buildings. The very mass of them makes them the dominating
                        factor in every community. This one room house was one of the most perfect
                        houses ever built although it was the least</p>
                    <pb n="351"/>

                    <p>costly. It nestled far back on its allotment under the spreading branches of
                        two giant gums and was so lovely in the midst of its everblooming garden
                        that Mr. G. and I used to walk backward every morning as we went off to the
                        office so as to delight our hungry eyes as long as possible.</p>
                    <p>A German friend was visiting us, Mr. Hugo Meyer <note>Hugo Richard
                        Meyer?</note>, formerly a Harvard professor, then writing a history of the
                        Railways of Australia which he said he found to be the history of Australia
                        and its lack of development. As we sat before the fireplace he said Pholiota
                        reminded him of a castle in Germany. The bringing of the exterior permanent
                        material completely into the interior would do this. And yet with this
                        material and its formal units we were continually getting the most exquisite
                        pictures with the changing lights of the day and the changing floral
                        displays of the seasons framed by our windows. The brass candlesticks which
                        looked silly on the piano were yanked off and looked handsome on the
                        fire-breast giving it an altar like effect when the morning sun struck
                        across the room giving brilliance and sharp shadows to the great clusters of
                        flowers which stood in a corner of the fireplace alcove.</p>
                    <p>There were so many ancient gum trees on this hill sloped river bank, some in
                        groups, some isolated, that for over half a century the artists of Melbourne
                        had gathered there for their camping outings to enjoy and paint their
                        loveliness. Many were five feet and more in diameter, most of them white
                        barked, not the tall towering species but broad spreading and very
                        picturesque. The owners finally decided to subdivide. They put the work in
                        Griffin's hands. In laying out this Mount Eagle Estate which consists of a
                        beautiful hillside and the flats below extending to the Yarra River, he took
                        great pains to arrange for permanent preservation of these trees arranging
                        the streets and allotments so that almost all of them were in interior
                        reserves. Such reserves cost practically nothing as they take up no street
                        selling frontage which also meant that they never could</p>
                    <pb n="352"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 352 ====]</p>
                    <p>be sold. The ownership had to be placed with the municipality otherwise they
                        could be taxed indefinitely and as heavily as the officials wished without
                        the owner's having any possibility of selling.</p>
                    <p>Two of these superb kings of that kingdom which alone can transform rocks
                        into living matter and upon which all other living things are therefore
                        dependent for their sustenance, he had not been able to secure in this way.
                        These worshippers of the Christ, the Sun Being, (for they like men can stand
                        erect and reach up to the Sun) stood in two adjacent allotments. So we
                        bought these two at the original sale. Such a joy they were. And fun too for
                        the small birds had taken possession of one of them. The large birds settled
                        in the other. And if any large bird ever presumed to alight on the small
                        birds' tree there was a prompt gathering of the clans and, with much clatter
                        and indignation, off he was driven. Our one room house looked like a toy
                        indeed at the foot of our great trees.</p>
                    <p>After our work had taken us to Sydney and some years had passed we saw a
                        paragraph in one of the publications saying that Griffin would be interested
                        to know that the ancient Eucalypts <note>Eucalyptus</note> he had taken such
                        pains to preserve had been sold by the Council to a man for a pound apiece
                        to be cut down for firewood. Such is Government ownership. This however
                        forewarned us to make different provision for the interior parks in
                        Castlecrag, Sydney.</p>
                    <p>Community functions which became so broad in their nature in Castlecrag were
                        already begun in Pholiota. Every Sunday became meeting day for a group who
                        individually had concluded decisions must be made as to a proper basis for
                        human communities. That meant we were radicals all, weren't satisfied unless
                        we got to the roots. So wild times were had but in the end even the extreme
                        anarchists agreed that a community must take upon itself the task of
                        maintaining Equity and only that. Only in Castlecrag in the later years did
                        we learn that communities require two other organizations, each limited in
                        its functions, one for Mutuality and one for Liberty which, naturally</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 353 ====]</p>
                    <p>would require totally different types of organization, as different in their
                        nature as the human body's head, heart and stomach organizations.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Some three years ago an article of mine appeared in the Sunday Times dealing
                        with the condition of affairs at Canberra. I pointed out that a Departmental
                        Board of disappointed competitors had obtained control of the carrying out
                        of Burley Griffin's splendid plan and while pretending to preserve the
                        "dominating conception" of that plan, were really imposing their own crude
                        plan upon his. I took the stand that as Griffin's plan had won the first
                        prize in a worldwide competition in which all the great expert town-planners
                        had taken part, if any modification of that plan were necessary it should be
                        carried out not by strangers but by the man whose brain had conceived the
                        original design.</p>
                    <p>At that time there were rapid changes in the personnel of the Ministers who
                        had to deal with Canberra. Of these Mr. W.H. Kelly, in a brief interval of
                        office, appeared to be the only one who rose to the true appreciation of the
                        importance of the plan. His successor — Mr. <note>William Oliver</note>
                        Archibald, a weak man, fell into the hands of this Departmental Board and
                        the whole of the blunders which have followed, and which have been exposed
                        in the masterly report of Mr. Wilfred Blacket, K.C. are the inevitable
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>AN AMAZING DECISION</p>
                    <p>What struck me as a citizen of the Commonwealth at the time was that public
                        buildings were being erected encroaching on the alignment of main avenues as
                        laid down in the plan of Mr. Griffin. When Mr. Austin Chapman, who deserves
                        great credit in this matter, demanded an explanation of this, he was
                        answered in words which created amazement at the time (but which we were to
                        appreciate better since Mr. Blacket's report) that "these buildings could
                        easily be pulled down when the final allotment of the streets became
                        necessary."</p>

                    <p>The Cotter River and Dam — source of the city's water supply, and a most
                        delightful picnic spot, must be included in your tours when you visit
                        Canberra. Here there is all the enchantment of the bushland, besides the
                        unforgettable spectacle of the waters falling 60 feet over the wallface of
                        the Cotter Weir — flashing, scintillating, crashing — into a rocky cauldron
                        below, like a miniature Niagara Falls. Here also are crystal-clear trout
                        streams, picturesque walks and shady swimming pools. Rustic shelter is
                        provided for picnic parties, and there are fireplaces and luncheon huts. The
                        Cotter River and Weir is 15 miles from the city, and is approached by
                        excellent roads through magnificent scenery.</p>

                    <p>The fatuousness of this was manifested to all those who had visited
                        Washington (U.S.A.) and become conversant with the series of muddles which
                        were associated with the great United States political center. It is strange
                        how history repeats itself. One of the features of the history of the
                        magnificent Washington plan is the conflict with stupidity which nearly
                        drove the great French engineer, <note>Pierre Charles</note> L'Enfant, who
                        planned Washington in conjunction with George Washington (himself a
                        surveyor) out of his mind and embittered his whole life. One of his
                        successors, <note>Alexander "Boss"?</note> Shepherd, was also treated in the
                        same way and he too succumbed in the battle with stupidity. To make a long
                        story short, when the people of the United States came to their senses it
                        cost a later generation $15,000,000 to restore the plan of L'Enfant. That
                        was the price that was paid by the people of the United States for the
                        bungling which proceeded in regard to their Capital for nearly a century.
                        Such bungling has happily, I hope, been stopped in the bud by the inquiry
                        now concluded and the report of Mr. Blacket.</p>
                    <p>AUSTRALIA'S CHANCE</p>
                    <p>We understand better now the noble ideals of the town-planner. He is a great
                        artist, a super-architect, super-engineer, super-surveyor. From his brain
                        springs the noble design of a city, not the mere tracings on the ground of
                        what direction the future streets and avenues, parks, playgrounds and
                        trackways shall take; but also it <note>is?</note> his to determine what
                        will be the design of its architecture, the convenience of its commercial
                        side, the completeness of its communication, the comfort of its habitable
                        areas and the general relation of all these parts to the whole and to each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>I have seen many planned cities, such as Paris, the new Rome, Dalny <note>now
                            Dalian in Liaoning Province, China</note> at Port Arthur, but of these
                        only Dalny <note>Dalian</note> was a pre-planned city. The others were
                        carved out of old congested streets and houses. The noble idea of designing
                        a city in advance, such as inspired Kitchner <note>Horatio Herbert
                            Kitchener?</note> in the new Omdurman, or those who dreamt of a new
                        Indian Capital,</p>

                        intentions of the big minds of the first crop of Commonwealth statesmen, and
                        an insult to their grandiose ideas, to allow any paltering with the plan of
                        the beautiful design of Burley Griffin.</p>
                    <p>I now suggest that we look to the future. Let us close the book of
                        incompetence and impudent presumptuousness and look to the future, keeping
                        steadily in mind the noble opportunity of creating a magnificent city from
                        this point of view. I want to deal with certain suggestions made as to the
                        future control of the plan.</p>
                    <p>THE MAN FOR THE TASK</p>
                    <p>A suggestion is made by Mr. <note>John</note> Sulman, President of the New
                        South Wales Town Planning Association, that the future control should be by
                        a Commission. In my opinion, and with all respect to Mr. Sulman, the public
                        reposes the utmost confidence in the man at present, though only
                        imperfectly, in charge — Mr. Walter Burley Griffin. Those who know any of
                        the work that has been done, and have followed the whole history of this
                        great enterprise with interest, know that no more competent man could be
                        found to place in control of this work than Mr. Griffin. He should be the
                        sole Commissioner.</p>
                    <p>We now realize, on the personal report of Mr. Blacket, the mighty wall of
                        incompetence and stupidity against which Mr. Griffin has had to struggle. It
                        is to be hoped that the struggle is over now. Mr. Griffin has gained his
                        experience inch by inch; he has confounded his detractors he has vindicated
                        his own capacity, and by that means he has proved himself to be the one and
                        only fit man to be entrusted with the task of carrying out his own design.
                        All that remains to be said is to express the hope that the experience of
                        the incompetency of the last few years will inspire the statesmen in charge
                        of the affairs of the Commonwealth to make up their minds to take the advice
                        of the one man in Australia who is competent to advise them upon the design
                        of a great city built upon a virgin site.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="ul">ARCHITECTURE</hi> ; Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>We take up now a problem that frequently comes before our big municipal
                        centers. This is not an actual project but an abstract problem taken up for
                        discussion in the City Club of Chicago. A number of solutions were
                        considered and are being considered in various districts for actual
                        execution. Chicago's plan like that of so many of our modern cities consists
                        of a quadrilateral plan superimposed on a radial one. It is laid out in
                        quarter mile sections and one such Section was the problem for solution. The
                        method of general layout means that everywhere in Chicago these streets at
                        half mile intervals become the lines of through traffic with trams, and the
                        consequent development into business streets. It also means that there is no
                        occasion for through traffic between them and that no business will develop
                        within them because of the advantage of the boundary streets in being most
                        convenient of access to the stream of people coming home from the city
                        center. Therefore such a Section encircled by neighborhood stores, shops,
                        offices, public service equipment such as fire engine houses, etc., offers
                        opportunity for a complete and secluded domestic unit. The first step
                        therefore is to destroy the temptation of using it as a thoroughfare for
                        which there is no need by blocking the center so that it no longer offers a
                        short cut. At last we have the chance to give a fair chance to the domestic
                        life which has suffered so terribly in the rapid development of out great
                        cities. How necessary this is we can get a notion of if we compare the
                        organism humanity to the organism tree. If a tree fails in the perfect
                        development of the blossom — the reproductive organ — the tree will soon
                        disappear, or at least degenerate. So with our human communities. The
                        industrial and transportation elements form the root and trunk branching out
                        from the centers, but the domestic element is the blossom complete in itself
                        perfect in form, and every community should bear abundantly these beautiful
                        blossoms. This example promises a Town Planning requirement which in this
                        zone shall limit the occupation to</p>
                    <pb n="361c"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361c ====]</p>
                    <p>8 families to the acre. The blocks have their interior open spaces where
                        little children can play with their companions and still be under the
                        Mother's eye and within easy call, where the older children can have their
                        sports without going a half mile or more frequently away from home, where
                        older people can enjoy out door entertainments without such effort and waste
                        of time as is usually necessary and where all have at all times the joy of
                        looking out on open spaces and beautiful shrubbery.</p>
                    <p>No one has more than 3 blocks to go to reach the community buildings grouped
                        about the center, schools, clubs, theatres, music pavilion, gymnasia, etc.
                        Even little children can go to the center without the danger of crossing a
                        rapid transit rout. In addition there is one of the most peculiar and
                        valuable elements in the uplift of human beings, a neighborhood unit with
                        its own prides, its own standards to maintain, and to compare with other
                        units, and that greatest of all beneficial restraints the knowledge that the
                        eye of your own people is on you to feel pride or shame in your individual
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>In the playgrounds about the schools games can be carried on under direction
                        and pools are provided for aquatic sports. Such an arrangement as this lends
                        itself to an industrial community with factory located in one quarter next
                        to transportation facilities.</p>
                    <p>LEETON</p>
                    <p>Next we will take up the general problem of laying out an entire new
                        community. Here the industrial elements must also be taken into
                        consideration. Leeton from the nature of its location and railroad
                        facilities will undoubtedly remain village like in character. Surrounded by
                        irregular farms it is itself located on a slight rise in the ground which
                        makes it useless for irrigation but very desirable for residence, with the
                        slopes catching the breezes and good for drainage, with such industries as
                        creameries, fruit packing houses, etc. on its railroad, and the axis for
                        retail business serving the outlying farms as well as the town. Providing
                        also common play space and Show Grounds and </p>
                    <pb n="361d"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361d ====]</p>
                    <p>education facilities for the whole district. The ultimate population is
                        placed at 7000 or about 2 families of 5 to the acre.</p>
                    <p>GRIFFITH &amp; MOSSMAIN</p>
                    <p>Griffith to be the Capital of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation District and
                        Mossmain, Montana, a railroad center of an orchard region, offer as does the
                        Federal Capital of Australia examples of complete civic units.</p>
                    <p>In laying out a city all the elements such as we have been discussing will of
                        course be considered but they must be taken up now not as adjustments to
                        other civic elements already established but with the opportunity of the
                        best possible location of each element for itself and its relation to the
                        other elements.</p>
                    <p>First of course must be considered climate conditions, desirable orientation
                        for utmost advantage of sunlight and shade; character and direction of
                        prevailing winds for refreshment and protection; topography of surface and
                        nature of water supply; natural beauties to be preserved and taken utmost
                        advantage of.</p>
                    <p>Next the nature of the problem itself — a human community. This when reduced
                        to its simplest elements we find has just two elements — habitation and
                        communication, and the reason why most of our communities are so
                        unsatisfactory in their general arrangement is because one or the other of
                        these has been given consideration to the detriment of the other.</p>
                    <p>Those centers which have gradually developed through the concentration of
                        interests of the outlying regions show a markedly radial basis through the
                        transformation of country roads into city streets. Here the element of
                        convenient transportation has predominated. Where an owner of property has
                        rapidly built up a community by subdivision of land and disposal of it we
                        find the rectangular or gridiron plan. Here occupation has been given
                        consideration and no weight to convenience of intercommunication.</p>
                    <p>As such communities develop we find the one method superimposed upon the
                        other with awkward acute angles resulting and often entailing</p>
                    <pb n="361e"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361e ====]</p>
                    <p>great expense. Often in the layout of new cities we find that there has been
                        no attempt to reconcile these two elements but that the results we have
                        grown familiar with in old cities are copied in plans for new. This is a
                        waste of an opportunity, as a radial system is the best solution of direct
                        access from outlying regions to a center of common interest, and the right
                        angle forms the best shape for building purposes the solution is to use the
                        radial system and bring in the cross streets at right angles to them. This
                        forms no acute angles and the obtuse angles formed at the junction of cross
                        streets are perfectly satisfactory for building and offer advantages for
                        community purposes. With this abstract solution of the municipal problem we
                        have now to adapt it to the local conditions and the individual requirements
                        of the city.</p>
                    <p>A photograph of the model of the site gives an idea of the general
                        topographical conditions though the fact that the vertical dimension is four
                        times that of the horizontal makes it appear much more rugged than it is in
                        reality, the slopes as a whole being very gentle. The flood basin of the
                        Molonglo River which crosses the site suggests the advisability of using it
                        to the utmost possible extent for water surface. The dry season sometimes
                        very severe makes the storage of water imperative and the modifying
                        influence of a considerable water surface much to be desired. There is much
                        talk about proper provision for disposal of storm water but in Australia the
                        first consideration should be its preservation. The problem is very simple
                        when one looks at it directly with open eyes. Nature records her maximum
                        floods and all one has to do is to provide channels for that maximum. If in
                        the main channel we arrange to use the whole flood basin for no other
                        purpose but the storage of water the flood water is taken care of. There is
                        ample rainfall to maintain the level of these lakes as guaranteed by the
                        original competition and borne out by experience since even this year, the
                        worst drought Australia has ever known, there has been excessive flow in the
                        Molonglo. The upper of these lakes originally intended to permit variation
                        of level with circumstances, can with reservoirs in the upper</p>
                    <pb n="361f"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361f ====]</p>
                    <p>reaches of the river be maintained constant. The probabilities moreover are
                        that in the course of time Australia will build another such dam as is just
                        completing at Burrinjuck which will hold back too waters to form a lake
                        continuous with these of the Capital and extend some 50 miles length to the
                        West which will place the Federal Capital on another such body of water as
                        the Sydney Harbor and make it unsurpassed in natural beauties and advantages
                        by any city in the world.</p>
                    <p>Since the special requirement of this city is the housing of the Government
                        one looks for the most desirable location of the group of Government
                        buildings which shall best meet present requirements and offer ample
                        facility for expansion in the future. The site conditions of this valley are
                        a somewhat extensive level stretch on the north bank of the river enclosed
                        by hills and mountains those in the distance to the South West rising to the
                        summit Bimberri often snow covered. Touching the boundaries of the area
                        determined for the city site are three minor mountains. The most conspicuous
                        peak is the conical Ainslie to the North East. To the North West is Black
                        Mountain, and to the South East is Mugga Mugga with the foothills clustered
                        about it opposite from the mountains to the South West.</p>
                    <p>The plain recommends itself for the business district of the city. There are
                        two possibilities for the location of the Government group, the slopes of
                        Black Mountain looking up the river, or the terraces on the Southern bank
                        rising from the level to Kurrajong, to Red Hill, to Mugga Mugga, to
                        Bimberri. A line drawn from the peak of Ainslie to Red Hill passes through
                        the peak of Kurrajong, is perpendicular to the river bed and is at an angle
                        of some 15 degrees to the North and South line hence most desirable for
                        orientation of the streets, giving throughout the day good shade on one or
                        the other side and giving sun to all rooms of the buildings. This line was
                        determined upon as the main axis of the city and all the public buildings
                        throughout the city are set on this axis. The importance of such an orderly
                        arrangement is always very great and can be especially appreciated in a city
                        surrounded by heights so</p>

                    <p>that from a bird's eye view one is repeatedly presented with the a spectacle
                        of the whole city. One of the chief pleasures we get in the contemplation of
                        any work of man is the consciousness that results were intentional. We
                        rejoice in evidence of intelligence.</p>
                    <p>With the local conditions well in hand we turn to the opposite side of the
                        equation, the requirements or this special city. We have to take care not
                        only of the Federal Government group. There is the Municipal group. Also the
                        National University and the Military establishment in addition to the usual
                        municipal requirements of any city.</p>
                    <p>The result of the solving of this equation we will express first
                        diagrammatically. The schedule summarizes the elements. In Town Planning as
                        in Architecture there must be a vision. There must be a scheme which the
                        mind can grasp, and it must be expressed in the simplest terms possible.
                        Just as music depends on simple mathematical relations so do Architecture
                        and Town Planning. In other words it must be comprehensible and the reason
                        for everything done must be clear. In this plan the land axis is made the
                        garden frontage of the city. At its extremity opposite the peak of Ainslie
                        is placed the Capital Building each offering and impressive terminal to the
                        other. Transversely and parallel to the water axis is the retail business
                        district extending a mile on the level stretch between Mt. Vernon, a low
                        hill on one side on which are placed the municipal buildings and an equal
                        eminence to the East where the railroad station is located. Between this and
                        the water are the Play Grounds of the city of easy access and offering to
                        the population of the whole city the spectacle or the Government group. At
                        the western extremity of the water axis at the foot of Black Mountain lies
                        the University group and at the Eastern is the Military establishment.</p>
                    <p>The Government buildings are arranged according to the functions they
                        fulfill, the capitol at the top is the monumental feature serving for
                        functions for the preservation of national records, the Westminster of
                        Australia. The Parliament House below with the various connected
                        departments.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361h ====]</p>
                    <p>Translating diagram into plan, the Parliamentary group, the Municipal group,
                        and the main Railway Station become the chief centers for radiating avenues
                        all of them so located as to give fine vistas with marked terminal. These
                        avenues are all 200' wide, a magnificent system and at the same time a
                        necessity because of the high speed traffic unknown 50 years ago. This
                        insures safety for with a double parkway the trams and high speedway in the
                        center can be somewhat depressed so that crossings can be made with a slight
                        ramp. This is the system followed in the Railroads. In colder climates the
                        occasional filling of these trenches with snow is a difficulty but in
                        Australia there is no difficulty, and the method has the added advantage of
                        making the tracks very inconspicuous overcoming the ugliness of this feature
                        which is such an eyesore in most of our communities. The Avenues develop
                        into business lines as through routes always do and will serve the local
                        needs of the districts they traverse. It also means that none of the other
                        streets will undergo the transformation from residence to business so common
                        and troublesome in many of our cities, for the other streets are all
                        indirect and a business enterprise located on them would be too greatly
                        handicapped in its competition with those of easier access. Therefore the
                        intraradial spaces become strictly domestic, and can develop in quiet and
                        security counting on the future as securely as the present, the spaces
                        formed by the obtuse angle in the center of these domestic spaces form a
                        natural location for a system of small parks increasing in size with the
                        increased distance from the centers and the consequent decrease in land
                        values.</p>
                    <p>This matter of land values which has been so disastrous to the orderly
                        development of most cities will be entirely an advantage in Canberra for the
                        Nation has taken the precaution to resume the land of not only the city site
                        but of the whole Federal District so that instead of going into the pockets
                        or private individuals for the enrichment of a few it is retained by the
                        community and will pay for the whole development of the city eliminating the
                        necessity of taxing for that purpose.</p>
                    <pb n="361i"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361i ====]</p>
                    <p>The building of the Federal Capital becomes therefore not an expense to the
                        people of Australia but a paying business bringing increased profits as the
                        population increases.</p>
                    <p>How great is such a source of income in such an enterprise is illustrated by
                        a lost opportunity in Chicago. Here the section one mile square set aside
                        for school use for this district is now the business center of the city. If
                        the schools had retained the ownership of this land the income from it would
                        be sufficient to support the schools of the whole state. Unfortunately most
                        of it was sold to individuals who rent it to those who wish to build and the
                        princely income now goes into the pockets of a handful of individuals who
                        absorb the community earnings of the whole district.</p>
                    <p>In the city of Washington as a result of withholding of land for speculative
                        purposes the whole city grew in the exact reverse of the plan laid down, the
                        part determined upon for the business being held at such prohibitive prices
                        as to make it impossible. After 75 years of this topsy-turvydom steps were
                        taken to remedy the consequences so far as possible though at great expense.
                        Many of the consequences can never be overcome.</p>
                    <p>Since the Barracks and the University do not call for central positions but a
                        certain isolation rather, they are placed on the outskirts, the barracks on
                        the heights beyond the station commanding the city, the incoming railroad,
                        the business avenue, and the avenue to the Federal Group, the slopes beyond
                        to be used for soldiers quarters and the plains to the North East for
                        maneuver.</p>
                    <p>The University, with its buildings also parallel to the main axes of the city
                        is arranged in accordance with the scheme of natural development, the
                        Technical Departments being carefully adjusted to the site conditions. The
                        Legal and Sociological branches being brought into close connection with the
                        Municipal Center with its Court House, banks, etc., the Physiological
                        expending into the Gymnasia and Athletic fields and river sports along the
                        water frontage, and into the medical hospitals located on the peninsula
                        extending into the West Central Lake, where</p>
                    <pb n="361j"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361j ====]</p>
                    <p>though directly accessible it still has utmost quiet. The Engineering and
                        Mining Colleges lie at the root of Black Mountain which can thus be used as
                        experiment station. And the Agricultural College expands into the open
                        fields to the North West.</p>
                    <p>Now we shall take up the occupation of the main elements of the city. The
                        Railroad comes into the main station through a subway of a few blocks in
                        length which entirely disposes of it as an obstacle and gives it utmost
                        convenience. Octagonal in shape, it can be used both as a terminal and for
                        through traffic without conflict of either with the other, thus enabling
                        trains to be piled up on the terminal tracks for the crowded hours and to
                        run in onto the through tracks in continuous succession. There can of course
                        be any number of intermediate stations as along the line and a branch can be
                        sent in a subway to the Parliament House. With lifts to the street level the
                        stranger even can immediately determine his way for the Town Hall caps the
                        hill at the further end of the main business street with the chief retail
                        stores and down the other avenue is the conspicuous Federal group. About
                        this center are the markets. The station itself is conspicuous from other
                        parts of the city. Backed by the Barracks in one direction and by the
                        cathedral high on the slopes in the other it forms an impressive terminal to
                        the two avenues which come into it.</p>
                    <p>The residence districts spread out from the various centers the most strictly
                        residence district arising from the attractions of the presence of the
                        National Government is located on the lovely slopes of the hills to the
                        South and West. The more industrial groups will develop in the other
                        directions and the suburban centers will increase indefinitely in these
                        directions with increasing population. The Railroad yards are placed in the
                        Northern suburb which natural conditions determine as the industrial
                        district. The first question of this nature which has come up is the
                        location of small arms factory. If placed to the East as suggested by the
                        Works Department the prevailing winds would carry the smoke and odors over
                        the most of the city including the</p>
                    <pb n="361k"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361k ====]</p>
                    <p>Government Group during the greater part of the year, 29% of the winds being
                        from the East during three seasons, 50% during one season, the windiest
                        season, and the major portion of the night winds. A crime in any case, the
                        preciousness of water in Australia would make the location of a factory
                        along the river bank as suggested such an outrage on the community as it is
                        hard to conceive any but a private monopoly utterly indifferent to the
                        welfare of the people considering. We have an instance of the perpetration
                        of such an outrage in one of the outlying districts of Chicago, where the
                        Union Steel Works have occupied the whole lake frontage cutting the town of
                        Gary <note>Indiana</note> entirely off from access to the shore and turning
                        the delightful lake breezes into an ill smelling and filth bearing scourge.
                        The development of the various districts is worked out in line with the
                        methods suggested in the early part of this talk. An illustration is the
                        University residence group in convenient juxtaposition to the grounds on
                        slopes of the foothills of Black Mountain forming a series of terraces, the
                        streets following the valleys and the homes on the higher levels. In
                        addition to the small park system and those in the interior of blocks we
                        have the great park system and a lovelier one no city can boast. The three
                        mountains are retained as natural reserves for the preservation of the
                        native fauna and flora. On Ainslie alone are buildings to be placed,
                        memorial buildings to commemorate great deeds and great achievements and
                        always so located and so constructed as to emphasize and not to injure the
                        natural beauties. At its feet begins the great midway garden. Since all art
                        depends on proper consideration of terminals the origin of this great way is
                        marked by the Casino and park accommodation house from which radiate the
                        paths to the commemoration grounds. From this point the midway extends right
                        through the city opening up the whole to the Government Group on the slopes.
                        When it reaches the river it spreads out into the play grounds of the City.
                        Here parallel to and one block from the retail business district of the city
                        consequently immediately accessible to the whole population are provided
                        recreation of all sorts,</p>
                    <pb n="361l"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361l ====]</p>
                    <p>the entrance to it marked by theatre and opera, its slope in the center cut
                        into to form a great stadium which at the same time shall not obstruct the
                        view across, enclosed by such buildings as library, museum, natural history
                        building, and at either end on the water's edge the Zoological Garden and
                        the aviary and natatorium. This Play ground is connected with the other side
                        of the water by a boulevard which sweeps under the main bridge on the other
                        forming a high speed promenade commanding but not obstructing the central
                        district of the city. While the upper and lower of the chain of lakes are
                        left informal the banks of the lower lake at the University being used for
                        the Botanical Gardens, the three center lakes have been made formal the
                        shape of the flood banks making this surprisingly easy requiring almost no
                        cutting or filling. This formality adds a touch of dignity to the majestic
                        Federal Group, and offers a mirror for its reflection. The water way is
                        sufficient for aquatic sports, the center basin being exactly one mile long,
                        and for pageant in time of festival. The city presents itself as an
                        amphitheater the Play Grounds providing gathering place for the audience,
                        the Parliamentary buildings occupying the stage, giving the impression of
                        one great building like some of the superb structures of Indo-China
                        presenting a facade one mile in length and piling up terrace on terrace, the
                        water gate in the center with the judiciary buildings on the lower level
                        flanking the forum formed by bringing the level of the first terrace out
                        over the roof of the Water Gate; the next level occupied by various
                        departmental buildings grouped about a central court with its pool giving a
                        stately and charming out door resort to the members of the government.
                        Terminating the court is the Parliament House set on a level 40 feet above
                        that of the court at its feet. This whole garden frontage of the main
                        buildings of the city starting with the peak of Ainslie to the North is
                        terminated by the Capitol building itself on the top of Kurrajong some 60
                        feet above the Parliament House.</p>
                    <p>Thus this stage with its lovely setting of hills and mountains in the
                        distance, the whole reflected in the lakes in the foreground makes of the
                        city itself a National Monument.</p>

                    <p>Just as the distinguishing characteristic of animals is wisdom (unconscious
                        but perfect) so is the distinguishing quality of man foresight through the
                        use of which he can attain free will. His course is not determined by the
                        law of cause and effect which rules in nature. He forms a purpose. The
                        effect precedes the cause.</p>
                    <p>When Griffin landed in Australia he immediately started on his quest. He
                        presently made up his mind to two things of preeminent importance;— 1st the
                        ultimate, since it was the correct, location of the Federal Capital. This
                        ultimate can be attained only when the railroads (all continental
                        communication) have been taken out of the hands of the government. Since the
                        voters are all, practically, in the coastal cities it is thumbs down to any
                        politician who suggests spending tax money on any other extensions. The
                        bureaucracy gets its revenge by placing the railroads in the wrong place
                        each time — climbing high over mountains though better grades are evident as
                        the wagon routes show. When that becomes obvious to too many they rebuild at
                        a better grade still reserving better ones for a later time.</p>
                    <p>2nd — The location of the eastern port of Australia as New York is <hi
                            rend="ul">the</hi> Eastern Port of the United States. Like New York,
                        Port Stephens has sea level entrance to the interior of the continent. It is
                        in close contact with vital mineral supplies and Newcastle is an already
                        established industrial center near by.</p>
                    <p>During that first year in Australia Griffin advised clients of the nature of
                        this district between Sydney and Brisbane and they purchased this strategic
                        promontory. He designed the city. It was surveyed, the allotments staked out
                        and the whole was sold from the plan in the Sydney real estate office. This
                        meant contour surveys were made in the course of which he became personally
                        acquainted with Aboriginals.</p>

                    <p>Port Stephens as the natural Eastern Continental Sea Port of Australia can
                        stand as the keystone for metropolitan, urban, suburban and rural
                        development or Australia for some time to come — as a pattern.</p>
                    <p>If the Town Planner had been consulted before the decisions were made by the
                        political organism, the Federal Capital would have been placed centrally in
                        the beautiful McDonald ranges — a vertical city since vertical
                        transportation is now as simple as horizontal. There it will doubtless be
                        placed ultimately as Washington in the U.S. will be placed in the
                        Mississippi Valley.</p>
                    <p>The other matters treated in this study would then apply to matters within
                        and without the urban limits. There would be Industrial Centers and
                        Agricultural Centers placed in accordance with the continental conditions
                        and the communication system could be laid out without destroying nature.
                        There would be other ports as at Portsmouth in Victoria located not by
                        pressure on politicians by land owners but scientifically placed and to the
                        mutual advantage of all. A Threefold organization would develop. When we are
                        dealing with continents we are dealing with ultimates.</p>

                    <p>THE BLUE VALLEYS</p>
                    <p>Just as the beauties of the Haven Valley are common to all the Australian
                        coasts, the flats above on this continental plateau may well serve for all
                        sorts of intense occupation, but the unique beauty of the foreshores, their
                        valleys and promontories, should be preserved for all time and residential
                        occupancy can use them but need not destroy any of their beauty. Thus
                        charming and spectacular sites for dwellings are to be found all along the
                        coasts. The flats above them sometimes extend to mountain valleys of equally
                        strange and unique charms. The blueness of the Blue Mountains can be
                        explained I think only by supersensible knowledge for in this land where we
                        find the Paradise people, and the pre-solid vegetation recorded in the now
                        material forms of nature, so in the blueness or these valleys we find the
                        pre-liquid conditions visible to the ordinary eye though no material name
                        can express it. For the blueness that fills the valleys is no mist. It can
                        be explained as the manifestation without materialization of the 3rd of the
                        4 Ethers — the chemical Ether which manifests materially as water.</p>
                    <p>Let us face the future of Port Stephens as the New York of Australia and look
                        at the spectacle of a city completely beautiful, correct in its location, in
                        its design and in its solution of its various types of buildings. There is
                        no reason why the earliest buildings as well as the later ones should not be
                        correct and correctly placed and all beautiful for as we have seen in our
                        preceding studies beauty is not an expense but calls simply for the
                        expenditure of mind and spirit which are not depleted by use but the
                        contrary. In other words it calls for the use of human faculties — thinking,
                        feeling and will (doing). Along the foreshore reserves would appear
                        dwellings for nothing but artificial land values caused by private ownership
                        of land would keep people from homing in the midst of such beauty. Town
                        Planning includes a Zoning system.</p>

                    <p>INITIAL . PORT STEVENS<lb/> [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of
                        this chapter.]</p>
                    <p>PORT STEPHENS - A PROPHESY OF THE FUTURE NEW YORK OF AUSTRALIA</p>
                    <p>Port Stephens is an illustration of what the Military department of the
                        bureaucracy can do with the interests of a nation. On arrival in Australia,
                        Burley Griffin immediately made the continent of Australia his concern and
                        found that the Western coast had two natural seaports. Eastern United States
                        has but one which has made New York city the inevitable seaport of the
                        Atlantic coast and the important city that it is.</p>
                    <p>At each of these points there is a splendid harbor and a sea-level entrance
                        to the interior of the continent. In his innocence he interested a client,
                        who was carrying on a considerable real estate business, in the opportunity
                        offered at Port Stephens which must become the seaport of New South Wales,
                        for Sydney which has a fine harbor has to transport all goods going in or
                        coming out over the mountains. If the railroads had not been nationally
                        owned, the settlement of Port Stephens would have taken place long ago for
                        the Port Stephens district not only has these primary necessities for a
                        seaport but is surrounded by a district rich in a great variety of natural
                        resources — coal, iron, and so on, as well as the magnificent agricultural
                        resources of the district back of it. But National ownership gives the
                        cities control of the politicians and officials through their preponderating
                        vote so Sydney has been able to maintain its interests versus the interests
                        of the continent.</p>
                    <p>Griffin had come from America where the privately made roads had brought
                        about a continental development and was enthusiastic about this opportunity.
                        His client bought this land, a magnificent promontory on this a finer harbor
                        than that of Sydney, and Griffin laid out the plans for a city. It was
                        surveyed and staked out and the allotments rapidly sold — but the story ends
                        there. For officialdom had its eye on this harbor and the Military</p>

                    <p>Bureaucracy was keeping it out of use so that they retain it for purely
                        military purposes. This destructive power won in the conflict of interests
                        over the constructive interests of a continent. Griffin had expected to take
                        up the development of Portland later as a seaport for that is the other
                        opportunity, a harbor with a sea level entrance in Victoria. But since Port
                        Stephens really proved to be a hoax he would not lend his name to another
                        such.</p>
                    <p>Now what is the ultimate consequence of Bureaucratic government? Suppose we
                        accept that truth is stranger than fiction and summarize the events since
                        the first war against Germany. What methods could an ingenuity beyond the
                        belief of the unsophisticated be used to maintain the Balance of Power in
                        the world from the British point of view, i.e., preventing any other nation
                        from becoming as powerful as themselves?</p>
                    <p>How did the world stand at the close of the 1st World War and in the decades
                        following? Who was the chief economic rival of Britain? I think that no one
                        will deny that it was the United States. Then what power could Britain bring
                        into war, for no matter with whom it was Britain could secretly or openly
                        back this opponent of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Now what has been the sequence of events internationally? First in the
                        Dominions the habit of hatred was directed against America and before the
                        war was over it was far stronger, at least in Australia, and more bitter
                        than the hatred of the Germans. Then the Japanese began to work up a case
                        against the United States regarding the treatment of her citizens. Here was
                        a chance and a secret understanding could be entered into. The idea of
                        Japan's initiating a war against the United States was, on the surface, an
                        absurdity but Japan was piling up war supplies, etc. No absurdity if she had
                        Britain back of her. But among other setbacks, the</p>
                    <pb n="373"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 373 ====]</p>
                    <p>earthquake came and burned up her supply of gasoline, which ki-boshed
                            <note>i.e., checked or stopped</note> war for the time being.</p>
                    <p>The next thing cooked up was the attack of Japan on China. America's sympathy
                        for China was well known. Of course America's treatment of the indemnities
                        after the Boxer Rebellion was an affront to all the imperialisms of Europe.
                        (We must remember that all Parliamentary governments are imperialisms.
                        Officialdom controls affairs as versus the people.) If only America could be
                        caught in any warlike act the trick would be turned and another World War
                        would be on. America's naval vessels were hanging around. Hoover's personal
                        (mining) interests coincided with Britain's, but fortunately the cabinet got
                        wind of the situation and gathered in the middle of the night to confer with
                        the president and insisted that a wireless be sent to the navy not under any
                        circumstances to fire a shot no matter what the provocation. So America kept
                        out and the Chinese drove the Japanese out. In that first attack China won.
                        So Japan backed by Britain, secretly of course, started the war on China. It
                        is nonsense to think Japan would have done this if she hadn't known England
                        wouldn't object. But again America was a disappointment. She took no overt
                        act to support China so another good chance for a World War and the
                        gathering of the clans to "Maintain the Balance of Power" was lost.</p>
                    <p>So then what? Well then the whisperings with Germany began. To be sure
                        Germany had a good many grouches and couldn't be handled quite so easily and
                        brought about a good many complications but yet the main thing was being
                        accomplished. A revived Germany was a threat to Britain if she went into
                        India. So she makes an agreement with her that she can have all central and
                        Eastern Europe if she will keep out of India. So the imperial game goes on
                        with endless twists and turns. Germany was again</p>

                        <note>Winston</note> Churchill replaced <note>Neville</note> Chamberlain.</p>
                    <p>There is really no answer but a threefold organization. With the beginning of
                        1946 we seem to have grasped that — a Security Organ with a police force to
                        maintain Equity. Since moral standards vary in the various communities this
                        will be the slowest to function well: an Economic Organ to attain Mutual
                        Advantage in production and exchange. This should be easy to get functioning
                        swiftly since it is already a fact though not consciously organized: and a
                        Social Organ to enable every human being to develop his Abilities to the
                        maximum.</p>

                    <p>In every department of human progress there have been long periods of groping
                        effort, a certain amount of human accomplishment largely attributed to
                        inspiration and a consequent vanity in those supposed to be inspired, and
                        hero worship by the rest, a large amount of imitation on the part of others
                        but no steady progression in the field till finally the underlying
                        principles begin to become apparent, the laws are investigated, the whole is
                        brought within the scope of the intelligence. Then the accomplishments in
                        this particular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with
                        amazement at the results.</p>
                    <p>We have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of
                        development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but
                        the development of this wonderful field was very limited till the law — a
                        purely mathematical one — of the conservation of rhythm — was understood.
                        When we learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves
                        with each other and the consequent destruction of sound and that the sounds
                        we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each other so
                        that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a development of the
                        art of music which is one of the miracles of the present time. A hundred
                        years has done what all the thousand of years proceeding did not begin to
                        do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learn this
                        fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the controlling
                        law.</p>
                    <p>Music is a time art measured by rhythm. To satisfy the human soul these units
                        must be preserved and must be so used as to reinforce each other, for
                        destruction is painful to us but evidence of continuity is a joy and
                        inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law.
                        Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made
                        conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elements in our present
                        creation, and in being made aware of infinity through the preservation of
                        rhythm, so in architecture and landscape architecture which are but
                        interdependent elements of one field, we</p>
                    <pb n="375"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 375 ====]</p>
                    <p>rejoice in being made conscious of space and can be satisfied only when the
                        space units we use reinforce each other and a feeling of spaciousness is
                        obtained. In a building or in a community a huddle and clutter of unrelated
                        units is as distressing as a harsh sound.</p>
                    <p>Let us illustrate this principle so simple yet so vital capable of so many
                        and so varied results. The first problem in this field is that of the
                        smallest unit in our life of to-day, one family. We take it in its simplest
                        distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and
                        conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its
                        industrial development to provide effective shelter and comfortable living,
                        though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use
                        utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we
                        are making or the conservation of space. Every family requires provision for
                        the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the
                        bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any
                        other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom.
                        Similarly the working quarters should be isolated, and so concentrated as to
                        save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in
                        closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private
                        needs the quarters to be used in common should be so arranged as to help
                        each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving
                        feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary
                        we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that
                        would be required for a small living room and a small dining room as one
                        room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is
                        empty and vice versa. With a little more leeway putting the two rooms
                        together in the form of an L adds a little bit of mystery. With a house a
                        bit larger a half story level scheme gives opportunity for a large living
                        room with high ceiling which its greater proportions prevent being
                        inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library opening out from the
                        higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these rooms</p>
                    <pb n="376"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 376 ====]</p>
                    <p>and a delightful feeling of openness to the whole. This arrangement is very
                        economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages of
                        both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation in
                        the heights of the ceilings of rooms of various sizes eliminating the
                        unpleasant proportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same
                        level from large rooms to small rooms and at the same time getting the
                        feeling of openness and distance, and in addition an emphasis as pleasing in
                        building as in any art.</p>
                    <p>From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two
                        families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work
                        together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by
                        intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one
                        of the streets of Evanston <note>Illinois</note> where the lots and houses
                        of approximately the same size are all placed each the same distance from
                        the other, the only idea being to get the most out of one's own lot no
                        matter what the consequences to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look
                        crowded and cramped for yard space, till we come to two houses (Comstock
                        Houses) that were built at the same time with the intention of making a bit
                        of music, instead of adding to the noise. Here in spite of the fact that the
                        size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that there is
                        ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses have
                        thrown their open space together, and have located themselves on the further
                        sides of their respective lots. This means of course that an architectural
                        problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house may have
                        equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about this if one is
                        but willing to take the pains. It means of course that the one house cannot
                        as a rule be a duplicate of the other. With this arrangement each house has
                        an open space to look out, twice the size of what it has with the other
                        method. The manner of solving this problem varies with the size of the lots,
                        and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there is always an
                        advantage to be gained by working together.</p>
                    <p>The Ravines <note>Allen Ravines, Decatur, Illinois</note> was the pleasant
                        problem of a piece of property owned</p>
                    <pb n="377"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 377 ====]</p>
                    <p>by a family of brothers (Mueller group of summer houses) who, with their
                        wives and children, wanted cottages for their summer outings, and decided to
                        build on this charmingly picturesque bit or woodland. Each family by this
                        arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be built so as to destroy as
                        little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to get as great a view as
                        possible of the river with trails leading to each cabin from the large
                        building nearer the main road which serves for accommodation house and
                        entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is the common garage and
                        caretaker's home in connection with which is the farm for raising
                        vegetables, fruit, etc. for the whole group.</p>
                    <p>Next is the small suburban group far enough out from the city center to make
                        land values low enough to use for garden farming — a group of five farms
                        (Emory group) <note>Wheaton, Illinois</note> with buildings so placed as to
                        bring service portions together making it possible to emphasize the
                        park-like effect of the whole.</p>
                    <p>We are able now to make some comparisons that will in a rather surprising way
                        illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing
                        together of sounds does not consummate the making of music, so in Town
                        Planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as
                        anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have
                        all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and the
                        law of conservation of space observed as in music the sound wave must be
                        conserved. Some illustrations will make this point clear.</p>
                    <p>Ridge Quadrangles <note>Evanston, Illinois</note> is a really startling
                        example of what a little geometry will do. I shall not blame anyone who
                        refuses to believe what I say because we ourselves could not believe our
                        eyes till we measured and counted over and over again. However we have had
                        similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of
                        course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more
                        economical is the result in terms of cold cash. In other words it is only
                        when we work for ideal ends that we achieve practical results. When brought
                        into the</p>

                    <p>office it had been laid out as shown by the small scale drawing. It is a
                        tract of land about 1500' by 2000' on the outskirts of Chicago, and was
                        better than the usual layout of that region in one respect. It had left the
                        usual depth of block the same but had omitted the alley so unnecessary in a
                        residence district, throwing that extra space into the yards. It was the
                        intention to build two family apartments on all the 50 foot lots and they
                        were placed uniformly as is the common custom. Realizing the great
                        importance of interior parks in districts so closely occupied we started out
                        to do that much. Instead of running the street through on the long side it
                        was taken transversely across and a short street brought into it. We had a
                        four acre park. The next question was - How many lots had we. On counting we
                        found we had exactly the same number of lots of the same depth and width as
                        in the other arrangement. Since the streets on either side of the property
                        were ample for through traffic added seclusion was given by this arrangement
                        and while keeping the width between building lines the same, the pavements
                        of the streets could be reduced, decreasing expense and adding to park-like
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>By a grant of 50 feet from each private lot leaving it still one hundred feet
                        in depth an interior park of one acre was obtained in each of the smaller
                        blocks and a 5 acre park in the larger, ample for sports for the children
                        and young people of the whole neighborhood, and by using one lot for common
                        a neighborhood club can be built. Indeed the increased value given to all
                        the lots by this arrangement would probably build a comfortable club house.</p>
                    <p>The importance of community instead of individual control is obvious since
                        parks could be destroyed by another cross street.</p>
                    <p>The feeling of spaciousness is also increased by reversing the axis of the
                        buildings and by staggering them as shown. In this way light and air and
                        outlook is given to at least three sides of each house instead of to only
                        two narrow sides.</p>
                    <p>Trier Center <note>Winnetka, Illinois</note> must be considered in connection
                        with the adjacent property for here we have a community which has taken full
                        advantage</p>
                    <pb n="379"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 379 ====]</p>
                    <p>of its school for neighborhood purposes. The school building itself contains
                        hall for moving pictures, etc., gymnasia, swimming pools, library, etc., and
                        the grounds form a lovely park with play ground, and apparatus for small
                        children and big, and with running track. So situated there was no need for
                        space for sports in the interior of the block and this space can be used for
                        purely park purposes or for gardening. The maximum feeling of openness is
                        given by grouping one-family fireproof houses in pairs with the service
                        portions adjacent and the least possible cutting up of the grounds with
                        roadways and staggering these pairs, not only in relation to the lot line,
                        but also with relation to the group on the opposite side of the street. Care
                        is also taken in the grouping of these pairs to give picturesqueness and
                        varying interest, uniting some with low concrete walls to give a feeling of
                        unity, and taking advantage of the material of which they are built —
                        concrete - to embower them with vines and shrubs and roof gardens.</p>
                    <p>In contrast with this residence subdivision on perfectly flat land is the one
                        at Grinnell <note>Iowa</note> where the somewhat rolling ground of the town
                        as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking
                        illustration of the impractical nature of these so called practical ways of
                        doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues,
                        fails to see beyond its nose and, curiously enough, fails in consequence to
                        accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact
                        that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the
                        parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having
                        decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives
                        him best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the
                        straight streets across this property, and had actually sold several lots
                        before he realized the difficulty he was getting into, for when it came to
                        putting in service, as sewers bumping up hill and down dale with the streets
                        it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the pipes for the
                        higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or there would be</p>
                    <pb n="380"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 380 ====]</p>
                    <p>backing up of the sewage in the lower houses. So the problem was brought to a
                        technical man for solution. By making the streets follow the bottom of the
                        ravines these difficulties and extravagances were entirely overcome. By
                        recognition of the nature of the location which made it essentially and
                        permanently a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide
                        pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that
                        instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66 that
                        is 9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the
                        average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there
                        was an increase of 30% in the saleable frontage, which, taking the prices
                        previously set increased the profits of the sale by £3,000
                        <note>$3,000?</note>. In addition all the houses were located on the higher
                        land, none in the hole and the whole took on the look of a park, and became
                        in consequence the most attractive residence district in the town.</p>
                    <p>And so it goes. In Vanderhoof, <note>British Columbia,</note> Canada,
                        desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first
                        ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they were laying
                        out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with
                        cross streets necessitating steep gardens in numerous cases and with no park
                        space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated, even if the
                        profits are to be increased but again that was not the case.</p>
                    <p>By placing the civic center and municipal centers so that they could be
                        reached directly by a system of radiating streets following the ravines many
                        of the gross streets became entirely unnecessary, easy gradients were
                        obtained everywhere, the depths of the blocks were increased till almost
                        without exception all the blocks had interior parks, while at the same time
                        the private allotments were increased from 130' to 150' in depth, and when
                        the count of lots was made there were still as many as before. So naturally
                        the client would have no objection to the advantages to be offered to
                        buyers, nor to the economies in road construction.</p>

                    <p>Out of another purely real estate proposition on the flat range lands of
                            <note>Idalia,</note> Florida, without losing any lots, we squeezed in
                        for the benefit of the community a central park, a civic center with ample
                        grounds, circular gateway park and open vistas down several of the streets,
                        across the widest expanse of the river. We go from this to a problem that is
                        frequently before our big municipal centers.</p>

                    <p>This Quarter Section plan proves that residential and social centers can be
                        established (housing as many families as the present crowded districts) on
                        lines that will prove to be a great saving to the community. The narrow
                        interior streets and devious ways make domestic life safe and delightful.</p>

                    <p>The crime is to do as has recently been suggested by our so called Town
                        Planners, i.e., squeeze out the parks of every quarter of the quarter

                        one side was adjacent to manufacturing plants. Never should the other six

                    <p>BUREAUCRACY VERSUS DEMOCRACY<lb/> Walter Burley Griffin - 1917</p>
                    <p>We notice in one of the recent Publics <note>periodical title?</note> that
                        you take exception to the fact that President <note>Woodrow</note> Wilson
                        appointed a medical officer whom he knew personally over the heads of a
                        number in the Department who had been there longer than he. We realize that
                        when we were in the United States we might easily have had your point of
                        view in this matter, but we feel that our experience here has opened our
                        eyes to what we consider is the greatest menace to democracy threatening the
                        world at present. I would be glad to have you publish if you wish a
                        statement to that effect, perhaps as a reply to your comment.</p>
                    <p>All of us are inclined to regard the Russian Bureaucracy as a tyrannical
                        institution, but most of us have to learn that this is the essential nature
                        of a bureaucracy, in other words of Civil Service, and is quite as true of
                        it in France (concerning which there was an illuminating article in one of
                        last year's Centurys <note>periodical title?</note>), in Great Britain and
                        its Dominions, and differs in the United States only in the fact that its
                        completion is imperfect or quite recent. We feel that one of the greatest
                        services ever rendered to democracy in the United States was by President
                            <note>Andrew</note> Jackson in his destruction of the Civil Service
                        System however unsatisfactory his substitution for it, the Spoils System,
                        may be. An analysis of the system will show how inevitably an organization
                        of permanent officials must develop into a tyrannical, inefficient organ,
                        just as in the case of placing any individual in complete irresponsible
                        power.</p>
                    <p>To take one case of this appointment of President Wilson's:- An executive to
                        be effective must have the power of choosing his agents, and if such an
                        executive is to be held responsible he must not be limited in such a choice.
                        If we, as individuals, were obliged to choose our physicians according to
                        their age we should consider it an absurd and pernicious method. Surely it
                        is quite as important that no such</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 386 ====]</p>
                    <p>absurd system should be enforced in matters of more general scope such as the
                        President is responsible for. The assumption that men who have been in
                        office longer are quite as efficient as the new comers is not only without
                        any rational foundation but is almost necessarily the contrary of the fact.
                        This is apparent in every department in which we have had the opportunity to
                        observe and is a point on which we have gained much information. It is the
                        logical consequence of irresponsible power.</p>
                    <p>There is, of course, no reason why a permanent official should not react to
                        his circumstances in exactly the same way that any autocrat does and, in
                        communities where the Service has been perfected, I assure you they do so
                        react promptly and effectively.</p>
                    <p>Inefficient as the Spoils System is, its inefficiency does not approach that
                        of a Permanent Civil Service organization, for in the Spoils System an
                        individual who temperamentally is inclined to be active and efficient can
                        act in accordance with his impulse. Not so in the Civil Service, since the
                        case and security of his superior officers is best promoted by inefficiency
                        and ignorance in the men about him. Moreover inefficiency makes it easier to
                        increase the numbers in the Service which increases the power of the
                        organization by its command of votes.</p>
                    <p>In our experience, one of the Ministers who was inclined to oppose the
                        inefficiencies of Civil Service was told by the head of one of the
                        Departments that if he did so they would drive him out of Parliament at the
                        next election which was then pending. They have, of course, a powerful
                        publicity organization, constantly using the news papers, and with unlimited
                        funds in the taxes collected. This power means that the nominal responsible
                        agents of the people, the Members of Parliament and the Ministers have, in
                        fact, no power at all for when, as of course sometimes happens, an
                        individual man refuses to be intimidated he is shortly driven out of office.
                        The work is systematically obstructed during his term of office and stopped
                        as soon as he is gotten rid of</p>

                    <p>whatever the expense or the waste. When it happens that any individuals in
                        the Service assist the responsible agents of the people they are knifed as
                        soon as that individual is out of office. As the head of one of the
                        Departments told one such officer according to evidence sworn to in the
                        Royal Commission which has recently been investigating the methods of the
                        officials in connection with the Federal Capital, - "The Minister and Mr.
                        Griffin are irresponsible parties and here only for a short time. You play
                        the game or we'll attend to you when they are gone."</p>
                    <p>That these officials snap their fingers at any attempt to interfere with them
                        is constantly shown as it was recently when the Chief Justice in a Royal
                        Commission exposed the outrageous management of one of the Military camps
                        and commended another. The man who was commended was demoted by his
                        superiors in the Department and transferred to a distant and unpleasant
                        location, while the one who was condemned was promoted with an increase of
                        salary.</p>
                    <p>That such must be the consequence of such a system is apparent when we
                        consider that the organization is self-contained, feeding itself only from
                        the youngest members of the community since no one is allowed to enter the
                        permanent service after he is 21 years of age, which thus precludes the
                        possibility of its containing men of education and experience; that their
                        positions are permanent; that no one outside of the Service can promote or
                        demote or dismiss any member of it, for the process of dismissal can be
                        accomplished only by a jury of themselves which, naturally, never dismisses
                        a man, thus safeguarding themselves for future emergencies. For instance,
                        one Prime Minister of Australia recently, new to his office, discharged his
                        office boy for insolence. The Secretary came to him the next day, told him
                        he'd better reconsider that, which he found was good advice since had he
                        persisted the boy would simply have been reinstated after trial by a jury of
                        his fellows officers, and come back to his position with</p>

                    <p>his insolence so much augmented.</p>
                    <p>It is but one of an endless number of illustrations that we could point out
                        that in this incident of the Federal Capital some 5 million dollars has been
                        spent by the Department officials which has not accomplished anything of
                        permanent benefit, a large part of which has produced no results whatever
                        that any investigation can discover. The Commissioner investigating the
                        Federal Capital finds the Ministers utterly powerless through the fact that
                        they are either kept in ignorance of expenditures or their instructions are
                        ignored. To quote from the Commissioner's report:- "As to finances at
                        Canberra, the evidence discloses that there never has been efficient
                        Parliamentary or Ministerial control and that moneys have been expended by
                        the officers without the authority or knowledge of the Minister and without
                        any proper revision by the officers of the Auditor-General's Department."</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs is undoubtedly the case in all established Civil
                        Service Departments wherever they are in this or any other part of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>As is the case in this country, a bureaucracy is the aristocracy and we are
                        thoroughly convinced that the only reason why its results are not
                        universally apparent in the United States is because it is so recent that it
                        is constituted largely of men brought in from the competitive fields which
                        means that now it may have a considerable body of efficient men but, once
                        established, although the Service by law permits the Minister to appoint
                        outside experts for special work, in fact any such expert, being naturally a
                        menace to the permanent officials because of comparison of results and
                        because of opportunities he must necessarily have for witnessing and
                        exposing inefficiencies in the permanent officialdom, will be interfered
                        with and blocked by the whole Bureaucracy in whose hands are the means to
                        prevent the execution of any or all work.</p>

                    <p>The menace of this institution lies in the fact that it is an autocracy of so
                        large a body that it is in the nature of the control of a minority by a
                        majority which is naturally much more difficult to overthrow than when the
                        reverse is the case. A man who had spent some 7 years in Russia and, while
                        there, thought no other people could be so under the heel of a Bureaucracy
                        found, after the same length of time spent in Australia, that the
                        Bureaucracy was exactly as powerful here. A quotation from one of today's
                        papers offers an illustration of what I mean by that - when we realize that
                        no matter what exposures are made no remedies are forthcoming: -
                        "Revelations of the methods of the Defense Department (one of the
                        Bureaucratic Departments of course) made during the trial of the defending
                        military officer in Sydney were of the most disquieting kind. In the earlier
                        stages of the war, when ordinary business precautions were sacrificed to
                        haste, allowance was made for chaos in the Department. But the remark of
                        Judge Scholes who presided showed clearly that a condition of inexcusable
                        muddle was permitted to continue. It was disclosed in evidence amongst other
                        things that sixty thousand pounds (£60,000) was passed through the
                        Department for payments to a corps that had long been demobilized. The
                        Defense Department was frequently warned of the hopeless drifting in its
                        financial administration, but the only response to criticism was an
                        assurance in superior tones that all possible safeguards were being adopted.
                        At Victoria Barracks, Sydney, even the most elementary precautions were not
                        taken. The unhappy results there do not of course imply dishonesty elsewhere
                        but are strong presumptive evidence of deplorably slipshod methods
                        throughout the Department."</p>
                    <p>I will quote another newspaper:- "Everywhere the Australian citizen may look
                        he sees himself surrounded by evidence that the direction of national
                        affairs is in the hands of messers and that, whether it be building a city
                        or running a war or a post office, muddle reigns supreme. In this particular
                        case of Canberra it is true that <note>William Oliver</note> Archibald</p>
                    <pb n="394"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 394 ====]</p>
                    <p>(Minister) was torn from his place, snarling about the unjust way he had been
                        treated. But his vast capacity for wasting money and making a mess mattered
                        so little that when <note>William Morris</note> Hughes formed his Rump
                        Administration, Archibald was given the place of Minister for Trade and
                        Customs - a job only second in importance to that of Defense Minister." But
                        the important thing to note is the succeeding sentence:- "Is the public <hi
                            rend="ul">never</hi> going to wake up and insist upon at least decent
                        administration? Or is it simply going on approving of politicians who
                        plainly say that administration doesn't matter?"</p>
                    <p>The politicians are blamed whereas there have been Ministers who have
                        strained every nerve to administer efficiently but for whom it was
                        impossible there being no way except to break the law - the Civil Service
                        law - and that would by no means be effective unless supported by the
                        people, which it wouldn't be.</p>
                    <p>An administrator to be effective must choose his agents and must be able to
                        promote, demote or dismiss them.</p>
                    <p>A comparison with individual business may help make this clear. Suppose an
                        individual adopts a method similar to the Civil Service. He will first
                        choose an agent but after this he will not be able to dismiss nor demote nor
                        decrease the salary of this or any of the subagents whom his chief agent has
                        employed. Not only will all the profits of his business go directly into the
                        hands of his agent except what is barely necessary for his own living
                        expenses, and perhaps without that exception, but all the income of his
                        other business, investments and inheritances will go directly into the hands
                        of this agent so that if the business is not kept running on a profitable
                        basis it can be supported by these outside sources of income.</p>
                    <p>How satisfactory would such an arrangement be even during the lifetime of the
                        agent chosen by the business man and how satisfactory in the hands of his
                        successors. Very satisfactory to the agent, of course, and it is he who
                        would be Kow-towed to by the community.</p>

                    <p>It is indeed important for us to begin to think internationally, and to
                        observe most carefully the results of systems that have been put into
                        practice. For instance, you would not be an advocate of the Single Tax
                        System if you were here in Australia. Our experience has warned us that the
                        Single Tax, adopted by any community under autocratic control, even if it is
                        nominally a democracy, is but the most efficient instrument for
                        impoverishing the people. The things these communities need to work for is
                        not single Tax but for abolition of Bureaucracy and for Popular Control. And
                        in the United States if Single Tax is adopted and the Civil Service left to
                        perfect itself, a generation or two will suffice to put the United States
                        exactly where the countries of Europe are now and bid fair to remain for a
                        long time to come.</p>
                    <p>The political agents of the people, and this applies to all European
                        countries as well as to Australia, have no power whatever except that of
                        apportioning and collecting the taxes. These funds are expended only by the
                        Civil Service Bureaucracy. The Bureaucracy is the aristocracy which,
                        hitherto, has worked very quietly, leaving the politicians to get what glory
                        they may from conspicuousness and to take all the blame of any evils evident
                        in affairs. The present situation, however, is enabling them to come out of
                        their hiding, for the demand of the people for Socialism which means putting
                        into the hands of the Government, necessarily therefore into the hands of
                        the Bureaucracy, all the businesses of the community, is a system which has
                        now been accepted by the established aristocracies who, already largely
                        bureaucrats, have seen that by this method they can perfect their powers.</p>
                    <p>Realizing, as Single Taxers do, that the measure is fruitful of good to the
                        community only when the government of that community is in the control of
                        the people, it is only necessary to awaken them to the fact that a Civil
                        Service System is necessarily an autocratic one, in fact the most powerful
                        of all forms of aristocracy. Probably the</p>

                    <p>only safeguard against the menace so terribly real at present, is a strict
                        analysis of the proper function of government. The human being has two
                        functions to fulfill, that of an individual, and that of a unit in a
                        community. As individual, his duty and his right is to watch out for his own
                        interests. As a Citizen, it is his duty and privilege to see to it that all
                        other individuals have equal opportunity to look out for their interests.
                        This means that the function of Government is the maintenance of justice,
                        and only that. All other undertakings are matters for the individual, which
                        he can carry on either by himself or in combination to any extent, even to
                        that of the whole membership of his community. But always outside of this
                        should be the governing machinery which should form no part of the other
                        activities of the community.</p>
                    <p>For instance, in the question of Single Tax, the Government should go no
                        further than seeing to it that this common property of the community should
                        be enjoyed by all equally, that is it could properly collect the rental
                        values of land but, after paying out of this sum the necessary expenses of
                        its own machinery, the rest should not be used by this organization for
                        expenditure for any other purposes whatever but should be divided up among
                        the individuals who, individually or in groups, could then expend it
                        according to their wishes. To unite the profit making machinery with the
                        justice maintaining machinery will cripple or destroy justice in the future
                        as it has always in the past.</p>
                    <p>The theory of government which prevails throughout Europe, that Governments
                        are organized for the <hi rend="ul">benefit</hi> of the citizens, has no
                        basis of justice and consequently no element of democracy. And you will
                        scarcely find an individual, search where you will, that does not believe in
                        the <hi rend="ul">benefit</hi> theory whether they call themselves democrats
                        or not. With very few exceptions they believe in imperialism in one form or
                        another.</p>

                        wake up and look for them. The recent case of the building of boats by the
                        Navy Department is typical, the officials spending $80,000,000 recently
                        building the same old boats according to their routine, indifferent to the
                        recently formed necessity of armoring them below the water line because of
                        submarines; introducing expensive new toys in the way of electrical devices
                        where it happens to please their fancy in spite of the fact that they offer
                        no advantage while tremendously increasing cost, neither extravagance nor
                        efficiency being elements that the Civil Service need to take into account
                        at all.</p>
                    <p>Or the case of another Department's having decided to build a high power
                        house on the Mall in Washington, only by chance learned of and opposed by
                        citizens who are exerting themselves to prevent this ridiculous catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Whether this revolution in Russia is of any avail depends upon its effect on
                        the Bureaucracy. If it is merely an ousting of individual members, no more
                        is gained than by the killing of a land owner when his son, or anyone else,
                        inherits his property. Unfortunately there are few in Europe who think they
                        believe in democracy who are not in fact believers in Socialism - the very
                        antithesis of democracy - the strongest of all forms of aristocracy, and
                        necessarily Bureaucratic for business cannot be run without an organ to run
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We rejoice of course in even a temporary overthrow of the Bureaucrats in
                        Russia and hope Russia may see the fault of the System. One thing they have
                        done which the United States would do well to copy. We have learned how
                        pernicious is the custom of giving titles. It is like a rot in the heart of
                        an apple. The abolition of military titles would be a great help in the
                        control of the military pending its entire abolition. It would puncture much
                        of the element of vanity and consequently much of its appeal to those who
                        are looking, not to render service, but to gain glory. One has to live in a

                        Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>All recognize the national obligation to complete the Federal Capital, and
                        the Prime Minister has promised that the work will be as vigorously
                        prosecuted as the financial conditions permit. Very well then the financial
                        merits of the project must float it, and rightly, as with any sound business
                        proposition, and must demonstrate that this is the time to do it. The
                        Capital need cost Australia nothing carried through to completion on
                        business lines, though further trifling with the undertaking, as at the
                        start, may prove as costly as the average bureaucratic enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Ordinary cities are profitable propositions, in fact cities exist in modern
                        times only because they pay, yet few cities in the world ever had the
                        prospects of this first and only capital of a continent. Melbourne and
                        Sydney pay handsomely but merely to a single land-holding class. Canberra on
                        the contrary with no land-holding class will be profitable to the whole
                        community. Fifteen hundred municipalities in Germany alone which have from
                        the middle ages controlled their own land have no need to levy rates or
                        taxes to pay their way and many of these towns have been paying annual
                        dividends in cash to their citizens.</p>
                    <p>Neither must a city be primarily industrial in order to pay, in fact such
                        cities pay the least in proportion to their population because the highest
                        values accrue to the lands serving the economically higher classes of
                        residential communities. None of the great Capitals of the Continent of
                        Europe - Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow - possess preponderant
                        commercial or industrial advantages, scarcely even a port. But these cities
                        have their attraction to the popular and political interests which they
                        focus. So does Washington <note>District of Columbia</note>; and in fact
                        London and New York, though great ports, are first of all the place of
                        residence and headquarters of the financial authorities who overmatch the
                        political spending power in such essentially</p>

                    <p>privately organized economic entities as Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                    <p>But in Australia the organization of the Government is the chief factor in
                        running the country and can we not expect to find in its permanent Seat of
                        Government such power as is already reflected in the, at present, generally
                        recognized authority of the merely temporary Capital, Melbourne? It is not
                        only ultimately that the Capital may be considered an economic factor in
                        Australia for from the moment of its establishment 200 miles from the
                        nearest industrial center it will open up for profitable production a
                        tributary area of 200 miles diameter with the deepest of all the ports on
                        the continent and attracting thousands of agricultural settlers tending to
                        loosen a little the strangle-hold of the metropolitan capitals which are
                        centralizing all advantages and forming an artificial development at the
                        expense of the country districts which latter cannot and will not receive
                        their fair share of legislative interest and assistance so long as the
                        propinquity of the great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the
                        people's legislative and executive representatives.</p>
                    <p>Canberra itself will be no mean city to start with because there are at least
                        4,500 official employees to be transferred forthwith. As a matter of fact
                        the latest Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner's Staff List shows 2,898
                        permanent employees a year ago on the Central Staffs to which must be added
                        also the Parliamentary, Railway and Repatriation, Naval and Military
                        permanent Central Staffs outside the Commission, amounting to 600 more and
                        no less than 1,000 temporary employees in all branches; altogether 5,500.
                        And the employment during ten years has been increasing over 10 per cent per
                        annum. The average pay of these Commonwealth Servants is £200 per year
                        whereas the average income of wage earners generally is only £172–13–8.</p>

                    <p>With such an industry as a nucleus can anyone question that, with their
                        dependents, with municipal employees, with all the builders, providers and
                        other professional and business agencies there will be less than 25,000
                        people in Canberra when the Government is established there? Far less
                        promising town-planning projects have been undertaken by private enterprise
                        for single plants of collected factories and are paying well. The town of
                        Gary, Indiana, without town-planning advantages and with its one basic
                        industry in the newly established plant of the United States
                        <note>Steel</note> Corporation showed a five fold increase in land values in
                        ten years, from £1,250,000 to £6,750,000 with an expenditure of only a
                        little over £1,000,000 all told on administrative expenses, improvements and
                        in taxes, to create this dividend.</p>
                    <p>Investigations by Dr. Murray Craig and others in the United States show that
                        a fair estimate of the increment to the land in communities generally "after
                        deducting the value which is attributed to all expenditures for local
                        improvements, etc." is about £80 to £100 per capita and according to Thomas
                        Adams the Town Planning Adviser of the Canadian Commission of Conservation
                        the assessment valuations of the Cities of Canada confirm these figures. He
                        states moreover, that in some Western Cities the assessed value of the land
                        alone is £400 per capita and a particular city of 15,000 population is
                        referred to showing £270.</p>
                    <p>The average unimproved value of land of all kinds according to the owners'
                        declarations in the Australian "Wealth" Census of 1915 was £92 per capita
                        but that may be considered about half the true value as may be seen by
                        comparison with the corresponding assessed value of £219 in New Zealand for
                        1926. It is difficult to determine from official returns exactly what are
                        the actual ratios between values of land and improvements or between land
                        and population in most cases because of the discriminatory practices on the
                        part of the assessors as, for instance, in the United States where although</p>
                    <pb n="419"/>

                    <p>the bare land of Seattle, Washington represents 78% of the total value of
                        real estate; in Newark, New Jersey, it is about 48%, and in Taunton,
                        Virginia, is returned as only 32%.</p>
                    <p>Yet in the absence of more accurate data it has been broadly assumed by
                        authorities that, by and large, the total values of site and all
                        improvements thereon are equal, and the most reliable evidence corroborates
                        New Zealand's methods of assessment in showing a land value over £200 per
                        capita. In New York City, possibly the most valuable improved piece of the
                        earth's surface, when all improvements showed £460,000,000 value the actual
                        land showed £770,000,000 value, the land representing £770 per capita. In
                        Washington <note>District of Columbia</note> where the Government has
                        contributed its fine buildings the bare land value is correspondingly fifty
                        per cent higher per capita.</p>
                    <p>Now when there are 25,000 people on Canberra the bare land values may
                        according to reasonable expectation increase to £5,000,000 whereas half that
                        amount would recoup the commonwealth for its necessary expenditure on public
                        improvements. These improvements however will in most cases as with water
                        and gas supply, light and power and transport services and building
                        accommodation, bring their own profits and thus pay for themselves
                        independently of the land. In fact in the successful garden city of
                        Letchworth, England, with 13,000 population these services bring twice as
                        great net return as the land rentals.</p>
                    <p>Were the land values at Canberra declared as profit they night, on the basis
                        of figures herein before quoted, capitalize as a 10% dividend on the
                        Commonwealth's investment within the period of five years or so that may be
                        required for the enterprise. Nor will these returns have to await the end of
                        that period since the constructing population may be settled as fast as it
                        accumulates and begin to show its return on the investment in a very few
                        months, - the first</p>

                    <p>services have been ready and are now waiting at an annual loss to the country
                        of £100,000 per year, for interest and maintenance which public economy
                        requires to be wiped out with no further delay. None of the work of
                        establishing this community is unnecessary for the Commonwealth nor
                        detrimental to any existing centers. It is a matter of common knowledge and
                        concern that this country is now short of at least 20,000 new houses with
                        which existing agencies are striving ineffectually to cope, but of which the
                        proportion needed at Canberra can be more economically established under the
                        conditions of town planning efficiency and concentration than scattered, as
                        elsewhere, in small or single isolated efforts. On the other hand, if the
                        Capital development is postponed, as the vested interests of Melbourne
                        shortsightedly are urging, until after the abnormal shortages are made up it
                        is likely to involve duplication and great loss avoidable by immediate
                        action.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Capital will cost Australia nothing. It is a business proposition
                        and on business lines will pay for itself. More, it will pay handsomely!</p>
                    <p>What is the use of talking as the Melbourne provincialists do. They simply
                        refuse to hear the merits of the proposition and hide behind the lie that it
                        is a waste of money and a Bush Capital. The only waste lies in leaving an
                        idle capital representing 1¾ millions already expended. An annual loss of
                        over £100,000 in interest, maintenance, administrative costs, etc. Instead
                        £30,000 yearly goes into the coffers of Melbourne landlords as rent for
                        office space on lands priced up to a £1,000 per front foot as against £5–0–0
                        per acre the cost at Canberra.</p>
                    <p>Canberra has been laid down on business lines after most prolonged
                        investigations, discussions and scouring the world. It is not an ordinary
                        matter of bureaucratic routine. Its progress has not been on business lines
                        due to such adverse interests as already referred to. The Government have
                        decided to keep the bond and honor the contract on which the proposition was
                        really based and go on with the project on business lines.</p>
                    <p>The country has had to find occupations for many thousands of returned
                        soldiers, while this national interest has been lying waiting, just the sort
                        of work, two thirds unskilled, that the average man could take up. The
                        Government has been forced to find thousands of houses for these men and
                        their families and by this demand has much increased the cost of building in
                        the metropolitan cities, whereas large idle brickworks, millions of bricks,
                        extensive stores of timber, cement, and building plant have been waiting the
                        resumption of work at Canberra which would help to relieve the over-taxed
                        building industry in Australia. If five thousand houses are erected in
                        Canberra they will relieve to that extent the national shortage of twenty
                        thousand houses, without adding to the government's responsibility or in any
                        way upsetting the real estate or building market. If this work was left
                        until after a slump the consequences might,</p>

                    <p>on the contrary, then be serious and to Melbourne in particular. In the
                        meantime there is an idle military internment camp capable of housing all
                        the workers required while the permanent settlement is being prepared for
                        them.</p>
                    <p>No city will exist if it does not pay. Every city is a paying business.
                        Melbourne and Sydney pay without a doubt, though Melbourne and Sydney do not
                        pay the residents as a whole. Canberra also will pay, and Canberra will pay
                        the whole people, because this whole people are the land-owners. The
                        residents will be freed from taxation, because the rent of business sites
                        will be sufficient to meet all public requirements, as in many of the free
                        cities of Europe, where the citizens instead of being taxed, receive cash
                        dividends. Fifteen hundred municipalities in Germany alone which have from
                        the middle ages controlled their own land have no need to levy rates or
                        taxes to pay their way and many of these towns have been paying annual
                        dividends in cash to their citizens.</p>
                    <p>Neither must a city be primarily industrial in order to pay, in fact such
                        cities pay the least in proportion to their population because the highest
                        values accrue to the lands serving the economically higher classes of
                        residential communities.</p>
                    <p>None of the great Capitals of the Continent of Europe, Paris, Rome, Madrid,
                        Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, possesses preponderant commercial or industrial
                        advantages, scarcely even a port. But these cities owe their attraction to
                        the popular and political interests which they focus. So does Washington
                            <note>District of Columbia</note>; and in fact London and New York,
                        though great ports, are first of all the place of residence and
                        head-quarters of the financial authorities who overmatch the political
                        spending power in such essentially privately organized economic entities as
                        Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                    <p>But in Australia the organization of the Government is the chief factor in
                        running the country and can we not expect to find in its permanent Seat of
                        Government such power as is already reflected in</p>

                    <p>the, at present, generally recognized authority of the merely temporary
                        Capital, Melbourne?</p>
                    <p>It is not only ultimately that the capital may be considered an economic
                        factor in Australia for from the moment of its establishment 200 miles from
                        the nearest industrial center it will open up for profitable production a
                        tributary area of 200 miles diameter with the deepest of all the ports on
                        the continent and attracting thousands of agricultural settlers to loosen a
                        little the strangle-hold of the metropolitan capitals which are centralizing
                        all advantages and forming an artificial development at the expense of the
                        country districts which latter cannot and will not receive their fair share
                        of legislative interest and assistance so long as the propinquity of the
                        great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the peoples legislative
                        and executive representatives.</p>
                    <p>In New York City, possibly the most valuable improved piece of the earth's
                        surface, when all improvements showed £460,000,000 values the actual land
                        showed £770,000,000 value. The land representing £175 per capita.</p>
                    <p>In Washington <note>District of Columbia</note> where the Government has
                        contributed its fine buildings the bare land value is correspondingly fifty
                        per cent higher per capita.</p>
                    <p>Obviously a city of the importance and prospects the Federal Capital of
                        Australia is will realize an enormous income from site values but even in a
                        town no larger for example than Albury with only 6,500 population shows
                        unimproved land values remain after all the values due to government and
                        civic expenditure have been deducted, through the rates and taxes paid on
                        the land which will capitalize doubtless to as much again. Moreover these
                        are war time assessments and do not include the surrounding areas as in some
                        municipalities as will Canberra. In New Zealand the average is £216 per head
                        for the whole country.</p>

                        <hi rend="ul">THE STRANGE STORY OF CANBERRA . AUSTRALIA</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>All creative ideas must originate in man's mind. Since there is no such thing
                        as a common brain they must originate in one man's mind. In the case of the
                        capital city of Australia (which is not the center of the British Empire so
                        this could not normally arise in the mind of a Londoner) it was James A.
                        Smith, an engineer of world wide reputation, who conceived and promoted and
                        carried through the Can'brra idea. But as happens so often his name
                        practically never appears in this connection. The idea gradually became a
                        centripetal force uniting the continent.</p>
                    <p>As it happens, naturally guided from the other side, inspired, he chose a
                        moment when a man who had not grown up in this tradition of empire and
                        colonialism but in America was Minister of Home Affairs <note>King
                        O'Malley</note>. He was one of a group of men who had been in parliament
                        from its foundation in Australia. Into the constitution at the time of the
                        federation of the Australian States had been written a 10 year limit for the
                        selection of the site of the capital city. At the end of this period the
                        site was chosen and announced in the public press. During this decade a
                        youth at whose request a Town Planning course had been created in the
                        University of Illinois - the first one in the world - had watched the
                        professional magazines for the announcement of the competition for its
                        design since to a logical mind there was no other way of determining the one
                        to undertake the planning since there were no Town Planners in the modern
                        world. And, mirabile dictu, toward the end of the decade the announcement
                        came - an International Competition for the Capital City.</p>
                    <p>Australia, not having attained unification through a revolution, had adopted
                        the routine type of government, the parliamentary, which puts the
                        politicians in the bag of the Bureaucracy instead of vice versa as in the
                        case of the United States thanks to the great genius of the creators of the
                        Congressional form and to <note>President</note> Andrew Jackson. In the
                        United States the elected government can, if it will, dismiss a civil
                        servant. Elsewhere the civil Servants can throw out the government whenever
                        it wants to. In the battle of Canberra this fact must be understood. It was
                        the fight of a single man against, well against on empire if one states it
                        in its</p>

                    <p>simplest terms. Griffin could not have lasted ten minutes in Australia
                        without this man who advised him when he arrived in Australia to return to
                        the United States. Mr. Smith was not a traitor but a remodeler of Empire, a
                        house-cleaner so to speak. Real power if it is not perverted to the
                        advantage of the individual lies in the individual man.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Smith got this wild Irishman, Mr. O'Malley, to publish the terms of the
                        competition. The Labor Party was thrown out of office in consequence but the
                        announcement was out. (Later Smith got the assistant Prime Minister of the
                        other Party to advise the Prime Minister to appoint Griffin as Director of
                        Design and Construction of the Federal Capital. Whereupon the Liberal Party
                        was thrown out. So the fight went on.)</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the adjudicators had been selected. They were to be chosen
                        by their official organizations - one by the surveyors, one by the
                        engineers, one by the architects. Mr. Smith was chosen by the
                        engineering-institute. The architects under pressure from "home" refused to
                        nominate one so the Minister, Mr. O'Malley, appointed one. However
                        Australian architects entered the competition but not the English. They
                        bided their time but this time it never came.</p>
                    <p>Plans were sent from all around the world. The adjudication went to W.B.
                        Griffin by a 2 to 1 vote - Mr. Smith and the Architect appointed by the
                        Minister. The third voted for an Australian plan. At the official handing of
                        the envelope containing the number of the winning plan to the Minister of
                        Home Affairs by the head official of this department with the photographers
                        around to record this event, Mr. Smith called his attention to the fact that
                        he was delivering the wrong envelope, the correct one was in his left hand
                        pocket. At that moment the cameras clicked. It made an interesting
                        photograph but the correct one was handed to the Minister. I am telling this
                        story at this late date because it is critically important now in 1947 that
                        Americans should comprehend the difference between the Parliamentary and the
                        Congressional forms of government. Except in the United States and
                            <note>"perhaps" crossed out</note> Switzerland and possibly in Sweden
                        not only Russia but all other governments are run by the bureaucracies. This
                        particular officer was one of several who were</p>
                    <pb n="427"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 427 ====]</p>
                    <p>condemned later on in a Royal Commission re Canberra works. I am told that
                        British history contains only one other case of a Royal Commission going
                        against the officials.</p>
                    <p>Meantime the Labor Party was again thrown out because officialdom can always
                        influence enough votes to throw out a party non-grata to itself. You see
                        Permanent Officialdom has the spending of all the money and has the
                        selecting of Temporary officials. This is one of the essential differences
                        between the Parliamentary form of government and the Congressional, that
                        great work of creative genius of the founders of America. Another is that
                        the Parliamentary cabinet Ministers are legislators without economic or
                        executive experience so dependent on the officials in government
                        undertakings. At least a number of American Presidents have had considerable
                        executive experience. The result is that in America 6 percent of the
                        population of the world consumes 60 percent of the products of the world.
                        You see people are all right all around the world if you give them a chance.
                        The British people are lovely on the whole like all other people but their
                        form of government is the masterpiece of Satan himself. The consequences
                        will be dire if after the war the institutions of the world are modeled on
                        this pattern.</p>
                    <p>The first thing Mr. Smith did when they began the study of the plans was to
                        have the presentation drawings Griffin had sent in photographed so that they
                        should not be seduced by their beauty. These drawings by the way were made
                        by myself. So they were tucked away among the archives. The second prize
                        went to Mr. <note>Eliel</note> Saarinen of Finland and they were beautiful
                        too but these two designs represented two different schools. Saarinen
                        imposed his concept on nature, cutting, terracing, formalizing the district
                        on traditional lines. Griffin touched Australia's native beauty with loving
                        hands. The plan, as an Australian writer puts it, "fits the location like a
                        glove." None of its beauty has been attained at the expense of nature. It is
                        a majestic union of classic and romantic. The judge found that every
                        function of the Capital City was located where it was to its best advantage.
                        As a Scotchman wrote Griffin after the adjudication, "It is the only
                        comprehensible city plan I have ever seen."</p>
                    <pb n="428"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 428 ====]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Smith went over it with a fine tooth comb as he did all the plans. The
                        decision was given to Griffin because it was correct, every need of a city
                        met, every function fulfilled and every organ located where it should be in
                        relation to others and where nature would best serve it and enhance it.
                        However the judges had no say in deciding who should have charge of carrying
                        the design into effect.</p>
                    <p>With the unification of the continent the rivalry between individuals for
                        control of the land rents became a rivalry of the States for the location of
                        the government within its boundaries for that meant the housing of
                        officialdom and the continual rise of land values. Victoria won out in the
                        first place but only after it had been written into the constitution that a
                        new city should be built. The bargain was that Melbourne should house it for
                        the first decade but that the city should be built in New South Wales only
                        about 100 miles from Sydney, within one might say not excessive commutation
                        distance from Sydney at any rate for the members of Parliament. It took a
                        decade more for Canberra to grow attractive for New South Wales members to
                        take residence in Canberra.</p>
                    <p>The proper method would have been for the city planner to determine its
                        location but at that time there was no such thing as a city planner. When
                        Griffin went to Australia he did locate and design the port and capital for
                        the new state of Northern New South Wales when the time comes for that
                        division and he also pointed out the proper place for a transcontinental
                        port in Victoria. Had he been consulted he would have located Canberra more
                        nearly in the center of Australia, in the McDonald Ranges, safer from the
                        military point of view, a charming location and one that would help to
                        develop Australia continentally. The government controlled railroads have
                        kept Australia from developing continentally as the U.S. did under private
                        ownership for no politician would vote against the wishes of his
                        constituents who objected to having remote Railroads built out of their tax
                        money. If it were not for obstructions from outside its borders there is no
                        reason why Australia</p>
                    <pb n="429"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 429 ====]</p>
                    <p>should not be as populated and prosperous as the United States whose area it
                        about equals except for Alaska.</p>
                    <p>However, though within his province, this was outside of his jurisdiction as
                        to Canberra. The location had been settled on narrow lines based on personal
                        interests instead of on continental political and economic lines. A district
                        to serve in Australia as the District of Columbia in the United States but
                        some 10 times the area was purchased at the current prices of squatted
                        property in the district instead being just one subdivision of the Nation.
                        This would of course prevent private citizens from reaping the fruit of
                        rising land values in the district. It also prevented in Canberra what
                        happened in Washington - the perversion of the business district where in
                        Washington the high prices charged by current owners diverted the whole
                        business district from its proper location, deadly to the perfection of the
                        development of the city.</p>
                    <p>Of course the right answer is to have no State lines. States are just
                        hangovers of old jealousies which have no meaning now, and consequently act
                        as diseases in the community. Tariffs are already being set up on those
                        lines in the U.S. There are just two natural government entities - the
                        continent and the city. Their nature is different and calls for different
                        types of government. The intermediate state has no proper function.</p>
                    <p>The consequence of this community ownership of the whole area of the city and
                        its suburbs of Canberra has made possible the orderly development of the
                        whole area of Canberra whether it be fast or slow.</p>
                    <p>The first thing Griffin did in Australia was to check the roads, then
                        thoroughfares, of the suburban districts to make them connect most directly
                        and economically with the neighboring towns. A curious thing happened
                        however for Griffin's design is not only for the central city, the area of
                        which was specified in the conditions of competition, but includes the
                        surrounding suburbs. The more or less frequent changes of party control and
                        thus of ministers led each new Minister of Home Affairs to</p>
                    <pb n="430"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 430 ====]</p>
                    <p>direct operations away from the suburb laid down by his predecessor to one of
                        the other suburbs as shown in the approved plan so that from quite early
                        days one could climb one or another of the hill slopes and look out upon a
                        whole city with all its suburbs laid out on the ground and occupied to a
                        certain extent while the population was still very small. Naturally there
                        are in consequence some complaints about distances. This premature
                        expenditure was really no extra expense since the government has to pay
                        neither rent nor interest on money spent and it and its consequences have
                        had a very remarkable effect on Australia. It means that while still very
                        young Canberra has become a great show not only for travelers from afar but
                        for the citizenry (even though there still remained different gauges in the
                        railroads of the states) and it has to a considerable extent broken down the
                        state jealousies. Australia now thinks as a unit as has been evidenced by
                        the astounding stands the present <note>Prime</note> Minister, Mr.
                            <note>John</note> Curtin, has been able to take, breaking down the
                        imperial barriers in a way that was impossible at the time of the last war.
                        Of course London foresaw that, which accounts for the opposition to the
                        competition for the capital city, and previously to the capital city at all.</p>
                    <p>After Griffin's death, a few days before I left Australia, I went with a
                        friend, a newspaper man, to have a farewell look at Canberra. Now in the
                        early days practically no one wanted Canberra. It meant financial loss to
                        both the big cities, Sydney and Melbourne, because the large and ever
                        growing Civil Service would move away and all their business with them.
                        Their rents and their purchases would be lost. So land owners and business,
                        sellers and buyers, helped officialdom - that is the whole citizenry -
                        helped to put obstacles in the way of progress of the Capital. But Griffin
                        always felt that "the people" really wanted it, really needed it and the
                        flame of his enthusiasm backed by the determination of Mr. Smith kept it
                        keeping on. He knew the people of Australia needed it and would awaken to
                        the need.</p>
                    <pb n="431"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 431 ====]</p>
                    <p>This is what happened on a farewell visit I made with Mr. Trinick. We both
                        went incognito. After jaunting around and seeing the sights we stopped in a
                        shop. Casually Mr. Trinick said to a clerk, "Well we tourists think Canberra
                        is a pretty nice place, but I suppose you people who live here don't feel
                        that way about it." "We certainly do like it very much," said the young man.
                        "Well," said Mr. Trinick, "I asked a man who it was that designed Canberra
                        and he did not know." The youth flared, "There is not anyone in Canberra who
                        does not know that Mr. Burley Griffin designed Canberra. They feel that
                        through his great inspiration the soul of Australia is being developed."
                        That was a nice farewell for me his wife and I realized that the old bitter
                        fight was over. Canberra was born undeformed and healthy and would grow on
                        and do her work.</p>
                    <p>We had realized this for some time. At the end of 7 years of service as
                        Director Griffin resigned. His plan was gazetted. That means that no change
                        can be made in it without an act of Parliament. The construction work had by
                        this time established the plan on the ground and Canberra had become an
                        established fact and, with Griffin no longer to fight against, the officials
                        began to realize that carrying on correctly would bring great credit to
                        them. And so it has been. Round-the-world traveling which had become so
                        popular before this war, enabled voyagers to see this really unique sight
                        from Mount Ainslie or Red Hill - a young city and all its suburbs laid out
                        on the ground before them, beautiful scenery with a background of mountains,
                        streets constructed, splendid tree plantings evergreen and ever blooming,
                        with street lights all in, Parliament House and other government buildings,
                        several residential centers fairly occupied, residences, shops, theatres,
                        etc. The one thing lacking to make a truly grandiose scene is that the
                        waters of the Molonglo had not yet been dammed to form the permanent
                        reflecting basin. The plan as one looks down from the heights will not
                        really be comprehensible till this is done.</p>
                    <p>When they take Griffin's suggestion and dam the lower Molonglo with a dam
                        comparable to the Burrinjuck, there will be an environing district for
                        habitation on water frontage comparable to Sydney's miles of foreshore
                        frontage.</p>

                        THE FOUNDING OF AUSTRALIA <note>1938</note><lb/> Delivered over the radio by
                        Mrs. Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to realize that Canberra is the only really modern city in
                        the world. Not that that has been made obvious to the casual glance, but
                        structure can be truly modern only when the <hi rend="ul">foundations</hi>
                        are properly laid for that particular thing and so it is with Canberra.</p>
                    <p>Its history from the beginning is the history of Town Planning or land
                        planning in modern times, say of the past 300 years. For this science (and
                        science is based on knowledge and not on feeling as in the case of the arts)
                        had died out and was no longer practiced.</p>
                    <p>But some 40 years ago a young man, who in his early teens had at times become
                        inattentive to what was going on in his school classes in order to play with
                        his pencil in scheming layouts of cities, this youth in scouring the
                        catalogue of his State University, saw the title "Landscape Architecture"
                        and decided to take that course. On arriving he found there was no such
                        course. However, on his demand and through his persuading two or three
                        others to join him, the course was created in the University of Illinois,
                        lying in that fertile Mississippi valley. Since then the course has been
                        established in many universities in Europe and America. Indeed the pressing
                        need arising from the growth of big cities in recent times, for up to the
                        latter half of the 19th century there was no such thing as a big city in our
                        modern sense of the word, this need awakened the conception of the necessity
                        of foresight in developmental work; and the increasing death toll arising
                        from the cramming in of modern methods into ancient forms made it clear that
                        the forming of cities should no longer be left to arise from cow paths nor
                        real estate subdivisions.</p>
                    <p>While still in the University this youth took note of the fact that the
                        Australian States were federating into a continental nation and then and
                        there decided to enter the competition for its capital</p>
                    <pb n="435"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 435 ====]</p>
                    <p>city, for to his logical mind it seemed obvious that since there was not as
                        yet an established profession of landscape Architecture the choice of such
                        an Architect could be made only through competition.</p>
                    <p>For ten years he watched the architectural publications and then, sure
                        enough, there was the announcement before his eyes. Owing to a busy practice
                        in 14 states, the months slipped by and nothing was done about it, though
                        doubtless the matter was brewing within, till finally his wife, performing
                        that valuable function of the Xanthippes of the world, flew into a rage and
                        told his that if he didn't start on the design that day she wouldn't do a
                        stroke of drafting on the thing. The design was begun that day and, after 9
                        weeks of driving work, toward midnight of a bitterly cold winter night, the
                        box of drawings, too long to go into a taxi, was rushed with doors open and
                        the men without their coats - no time to go up 16 stories to get them -
                        across the city to the last train that could meet the last boat for
                        Australia, the imperturbable Mr. Griffin himself the only one not quite
                        frantic by this time because to his mind if Australia was serious about the
                        matter of their Federal Capital they wouldn't let the moment of the arrival
                        of the plans be the determining factor in their choice and, to his land
                        planning mind they couldn't but be serious in such a matter.</p>
                    <p>A year later the cable came that Walter Burley Griffin had won the prize. His
                        words on receiving the message were: - "Ah then I shan't be able to see a
                        plan better than mine."</p>
                    <p>A year later again he arrived in Australia taking up his duties as Federal
                        Director of Design and Construction and for seven years gave himself to the
                        work. His plan was gazetted which means that it cannot be deviated from
                        except by an act of Parliament. And at the present time Canberra has become
                        a center of interest to Australia and to the world though few yet realize
                        its potentialities. A few months before his death Mr. Griffin, who kept
                        himself thoroughly posted on matters architectural, said to me that nothing
                        had yet been put forward in</p>
                    <pb n="436"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 436 ====]</p>
                    <p>Town Planning that was not already incorporated in the Canberra plan.</p>
                    <p>Cities are growing things, developing during the centuries, but today, after
                        two decades, from the top of Mount Ainslie, one can look down on the layout
                        on the ground of a city with all its suburbs complete. Mr. Griffin did not
                        expect to see these suburbs in his lifetime. It is one of the world's unique
                        sights. You see a government doesn't have to pay interest on its capital
                        investment so can afford to do such things.</p>
                    <p>There, to the knowing eye, is revealed the fact that here at least the two
                        essential factors of a city were considered simultaneously and so solved
                        perfectly, the conditions of occupation which require right angle, or obtuse
                        angle, allotments, and those of distribution which require radiating
                        thoroughfares.</p>
                    <p>City planning, as founded by Mr. Griffin, was not a mechanical drafting board
                        affair later to be imposed upon the earth destroying whatever got in the way
                        of this abstraction which might produce a certain monumental beauty but
                        could only be a dead or dying thing doing its share, not toward keeping the
                        Earth alive but toward killing it entirely as seems to be the only way in
                        which the Egos of our people can express themselves at the present time.
                        However we can keep up our courage knowing that the nature of the Ego, at
                        first destructive, later can become constructive.</p>
                    <p>In planning Canberra every detail of the natural conditions was thoroughly
                        studied in order to preserve them and to make the most of each and
                        everything so that the City can indeed be a living thing, a healthy, growing
                        thing. Such reverence for our Mother Earth is acutely necessary now for the
                        rate of destruction is increasing so rapidly that even a century or two may
                        make the earth incapable of supporting life, the conclusions of geologists
                        speaking in terms of former long geological periods to the contrary
                        notwithstanding. Their theories fall down before actual facts. And the
                        continent of Australia would do well to learn this lesson from its Capital.</p>
                    <pb n="437"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 437 ====]</p>
                    <p>In the layout of this city alone have the requirements for modern high speed
                        been met in the two hundred feet wide avenues which are the business streets
                        and extend from center to center of the various suburbs making possible the
                        accommodation of high, low and medium speed at different levels and without
                        level crossings which when put into effect will wipe out the heavy death
                        rate of our present highways. The subsidiary distributing domestic roads
                        leading off at right angles from the business avenues are, as they should
                        be, devious and narrow used as they should be only to bring residents and
                        their services to the dwellings and domestic community buildings.</p>
                    <p>In addition the whole residential area has central open park and play space
                        off the street frontages in the interior of blocks so that children can
                        reach their destinations in going to school or other community functions
                        without traveling on the roads at all but by following park paths which can
                        dip under even the slow traffic roads by subway paths. And adult population
                        in the evenings can also take these pleasant ways to the interior central
                        groups of club rooms, gymnasia, museums, libraries, sport fields and so on.
                        The city is thus dotted with open spaces which are no extravagance because
                        they occupy no street frontage.</p>
                    <p>From the hill tops, though a spectacular sight, the city plan cannot yet be
                        understood because the water axis, a system of waterways which will entail
                        but a trifling expense, has not yet been established. When this is done
                        which will probably be in the near future the delightful water sports will
                        be available for the citizenry, and Canberra will have become a true garden
                        city for a garden is not a garden without water. When in carrying on that
                        most important of Australia's works, the impounding of water, another dam
                        comparable to that of Burrinjuck has been constructed somewhat below the
                        city there will arise a body of water comparable to the Sydney Harbor giving
                        some 50 miles of superbly beautiful residential area.</p>

                    <p>When the individual citizenry of Canberra realizes that a city can be
                        beautiful only when the buildings are beautiful and when they lose that
                        Anglo Saxon puritanical feeling that it is immoral to express and clothe
                        themselves in beauty, though at the same time they look with envy as well as
                        contempt at beauty expressed by other peoples, when each one realizes that
                        it is his duty to see to it that his own building, be it residence or shop
                        or office, is beautiful and at the same time contributes to an harmonious
                        ensemble, when he realizes that the flat roof, so appropriate to these
                        climates, doubles the area of his home either for entertainment or garden
                        without any increase of cost, when he realizes that the colors used should
                        not be a shock in the garden but in accord with the colors of nature about
                        him, when he realizes that beauty is a necessity for the health of himself
                        and his children, when he realizes that what each one does should make the
                        city as you look at it from the hill tops look not less but more beautiful,
                        when he realizes that each one can assist not in denuding but in reclothing
                        all the hills not only with soft wood forests but with native loveliness,
                        perhaps taking Mr. Griffin's suggestion to plant each hill with a
                        distinctive color, one with reds, another with blues, another with yellow
                        and gold and so on, then what a breath taking thing the heart of Australia
                        will have become.</p>

                    <p>FEDERAL CAPITAL</p>
                    <p>The Federal Capital started a new era in Australia. Perhaps that is a better
                        way to put it than to say that Mr. Griffin started a new era. Then again
                        perhaps we should say James Alexander Smith started a new era in Australia
                        for he not only carried the Federal Capital through but he trained a whole
                        group of young engineers who have done things in these recent decades,
                        climaxing with Mr. <note>John</note> Curtin as Prime Minister who did
                        amazing things. His untimely death is a shocking thing.</p>
                    <p>But my story is Griffin's adventure.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before I left Australia, I motored down to Canberra with the Trinick
                        family for the spring show of blossoms for its streets are superbly planted.
                        Mr. Trinick, curious about the feeling in Canberra, said to an attendant in
                        one of the shops: - "We tourists enjoy Canberra immensely but I suppose you
                        folks who have to live down here feel differently," and he suggested that it
                        wasn't even generally known who was the designer. The young man answered
                        with some warmth:- "We like it down here very much and everyone here knows
                        that Mr. Griffin designed Canberra and they feel that through that great
                        conception of his the soul of Australia is being developed."</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>AT THE CAPITAL - UNSUNG NATAL DAY</p>
                    <p>Amongst all the worries of war and the lingering thrills of Mother's Day a
                        notable anniversary passed last Sunday unhonoured and unsung. It was the
                        16th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House, Canberra, by the Duke
                        of York, now King George VI. It was also the 42nd anniversary of the opening
                        of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by a former Duke of
                        York who afterwards graced the throne as King George V (father of the
                        present King). Surely it was a day of great memories. Monday May 9th 1927,
                        "a day of perfect Australian sunshine" at the new Federal Capital (see Argus
                        report May 5, 1927) lives in memory among all who are left of the 20,000 or
                        30,000 people who were there on that historic occasion, as a day of great
                        splendour and dignity and excitement to say nothing of the noise. You will
                        remember (if you were there) the strange setting for the unique event - the
                        new white House of Parliament away out in the open country, gleaming in the
                        sunshine; other white buildings (including two blocks of administrative
                        offices) at odd places in the wide open spaces round about, some of them
                        still in the making; numbers of marquees and tents scattered about the
                        locality too; the new roads, winding about the landscape, shadeless and bare
                        but for the lines of tree seedlings on either side; piles of building
                        material here and there, and other signs of a new city coming into being.
                        You will remember too the great crowd of expectant visitors and the hundreds
                        of motor cars that carried them there from Sydney, from Melbourne, from
                        Brisbane, Adelaide, Goulburn, Wagga Wagga, and no one knows how many other
                        places. .......</p>

                    <p>In contrast to the strange, almost drab scene presented by the Federal
                        Capital 16 years ago, Canberra today in a city of exquisite beauty. The
                        seedlings of 16 years ago are fine trees, and there are not only many
                        thousands of trees, there are</p>

                    <p>thousands of varieties. As cities are proclaimed according to population and
                        rating values - or whatever value might be taken into account under local
                        government acts in the distinguishing between towns and cities - Canberra
                        might not be regarded as a city at all. It has only about 2,500 houses, and
                        not a great number of other buildings, and the population of the whole
                        capital territory is little more than 12,000. Yet is not a mere town. It is
                        more like a town than a city. It is a Town Planner's dream come true; an
                        enduring testimonial to the genius of the late Walter Burley Griffin, the
                        Chicago architect who won the Commonwealth Government's prize for the design
                        for the Federal Capital. It is a place of beautiful buildings, beautiful
                        trees, and beautiful flowers, to say nothing about the inhabitants. There
                        are no high buildings, nor ugly buildings, nor slums; no horrible street
                        hordings <note>hoarding, i.e., temporary board fence around a construction
                            site?</note>, no unsightly fences. Instead of the customary picket
                        fences in front of houses in the residential areas there are low hedges, and
                        these are trimmed and kept in uniform order by the Department of the
                        Interior. Almost every street has a central plantation, and there are plenty
                        of public parks and gardens. Through the trees in many places are to be seen
                        beautiful views of the distant hills and mountain ranges. Beautiful
                        Canberra.</p>
