                    <p>Caption</p>
                    <p>Walter Burley Griffin - who raced through his 20th century incarnation
                        creating designs, architectural and town planning, in most of the
                        departments of today's communities so that at least they might be recorded
                        in the others and so accessible to creative thinkers of the profession of
                        Town Planning &amp; Architecture - out of the blue.</p>
                    <p>In both these fields he was functioning before he left high school.</p>
                    <p>The first city plan he laid down was for a Chinese client for China. The
                        underlying principles were clearly established here - the laws of
                        distribution and occupation.</p>
                    <p>Just so in his brother's home was the continuous second story sill line laid
                        down so generally followed by the Chicago School of Architecture perhaps
                        under the influence of the Japanese prints brought to their exhibit in
                        Chicago's Columbian Exposition in the last decade of the 19th century, when
                        Spiritual influences were concentrating to transform rational thinking
                        (which had been necessary to bring about the individualizing of men) into
                        creative thinking which would give them freedom in the true sense of the
                        word, as opposed to license.</p>

                    <p>A NEW HISTORICAL PERIOD</p>
                    <note>The word "Introduction" is crossed out.</note>
                    <p>A new historical period which ended the renaissance of the Greek period, a
                        solar cycle of 5000 years, began with the turn of the 20th century. It
                        differs essentially from past periods in that human beings are no longer
                        under the domination of a folk soul.</p>
                    <p>Louis Sullivan was the founder in America of modern architecture and has had
                        perhaps more influence in Europe than in America, at least an architecture
                        no longer under the domination of ancient forms; but with the private
                        ownership of land, which unfortunately succeeded Federal control in the
                        United States, the development of architecture was stymied until the
                        profession of community planning, which alone could give architecture a free
                        chance in post-feudal times, was established by Walter Burley Griffin and
                        the University of Illinois. This has still dragged because only by a unified
                        control of considerable areas of ground could much town planning, and
                        therefore architecture, blossom.</p>
                    <p>The growth of modern architecture still awaits the removal of the poison of
                        private ownership of land. This can be brought about wholesomely only when
                        the Threefold organization is effected. This is at present expressed, though
                        scarcely on its feet, in the United Nations with its Security (political)
                        Organ, properly a police Organization whose only function is to maintain
                        Equity - like the policeman on the street corner - and second its Economic
                        Organ and third its Social (or Abilities) Organ.</p>
                    <p>The collection and allocation of the land values, though required by the
                        Political Organ, would be in the hands of the Social Organ, and would be
                        used to enable every citizen to develop his own abilities to the maximum
                        throughout his life, facilities for this provided for him from birth to
                        death.</p>
                    <p>Griffin was enabled to develop modern architecture largely though the
                        considerable areas owned by his clients or himself. Naturally these
                        opportunities enabled his work to have sufficient character to influence</p>

                    <p>a body and a soul and a spirit. They all need to be fed. Feed only the body
                        and the other two thirds of him <note>the citizen?, the human being?</note>
                        die. He becomes only body, not an animal but a beast. We see this in Europe
                        now. In earlier civilization the overlords lived in close centers. The
                        people, farmers, spent their days in the broad surrounding open spaces. The
                        ancient type of city was properly planned for its time and has great beauty
                        and magnificence. In our industrial civilization only the overlords can
                        afford to live in the wide open spaces. The citizens, the workers, are
                        packed into the cities, great space but solidly packed, slums and nothing
                        but slums, but the wealthy can escape from their more expensive slum
                        districts.</p>
                    <p>Now the problem of putting Chicago to rights in the matter of residential
                        requirements was solved in the 2nd decade of this century in a competition
                        fostered by the Chicago architects. The solution could be applied to any
                        part of the city as well as to all the outlying districts which have been
                        settled and are still to be settled during the succeeding decades. Nothing
                        has been done correctly because the man who solved the problem went to the
                        antipodes where he died. One other architect has put forth this same plan
                        except that he has used only the suggested economy of the street arrangement
                        and squeezed out all the open spaces to add more streets and more
                        congestion. This plan has been published in the news papers recently. It
                        would be a crime to use it. But why not use the original plan. I can think
                        of no reason except that each architect feels that he should respect in
                        others what he demands for himself, claiming that what he designs belongs to
                        him. So they continue to grope around for some other answer and nothing else
                        is the answer. So a professional vice is holding up the carrying into effect
                        of this vital work and slumdom continues to be universal in all the
                        residential districts of Chicago. For a residential district which does not
                        provide direct access from homes to open spaces without the crossing of
                        thoroughfares</p>

                    <p>At about this time Bailey's <note>Liberty Hyde Bailey's?</note> volumes on
                        plants were published. He <note>Griffin</note> devoured them and what he
                        read the remembered. Twenty years later, in Australia, when he found a
                        flower described in Bailey's he could name it.</p>
                    <p>One of his basic works there was training the citizenry not to destroy
                        nature. Though younger than <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright he was
                        practicing architecture while Wright was still in Sullivan's office, and
                        when he entered into partnership with Wright the work immediately reflected
                        his <note>Griffin's</note> influence. Wright himself called my attention to
                        this fact.</p>

                    <p>Of course the new type will differ as radically from English, Scotch or Welsh
                        or Irish prototypes as climate, temperament and social conditions are
                        divergent.</p>
                    <p>Cottages in Britain are pretty in their very pettiness and fit naturally into
                        little isolated villages. Here dwellings must be congregated in enormous
                        colonies.</p>
                    <p>The old standard was that of individual effort, or handicraft, crudity and
                        inefficiency. The new is of cooperative effort, machinery precision and
                        economy. The former provided physical protection to the human animal. The
                        latter must afford, in the home, comfort and facilities for sedentary
                        pursuits and the nourishing of intellectual growth.</p>
                    <p>So might an infinitude of parallels be drawn, all pointing to the foolishness
                        of attempting to bind ourselves with the very shackles that determined the
                        old styles, which is the very thing we do when we look to precedent for our
                        inspirations.</p>
                    <p>In a sentence, the conditions and the environment require an intelligent
                        appreciation.</p>
                    <p>To produce a modern style we must first master the possibilities and
                        comprehend the reasonable limitations of our new and complicated
                        constructive media. Whereas of old the architect need merely be familiar
                        with the economies of simple masonry and carpentry, today it is a question
                        of the science of engineering, and then not only static, but embracing
                        equipment and distributive systems that are dynamic. Only the student
                        inducted into engineering, versed in the technique, is in a position to
                        apply and develop in architecture those basic laws that govern our
                        intuitions of time and space, or line, mass and proportion which apply to

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>In one of his very early jobs - that of his brother's dwelling in
                        Edwardsville, near St. Louis, Griffin introduced a quite new type of
                        dwelling. Here already the second story continuous sill line was
                        established.</p>
                    <p>This again was not a merely superficial but basic architecture which lies in
                        the plan primarily and not purely in superficialities. Griffin was a
                        conserver of space.</p>
                    <p>In our cold climates where heat for winter has to be supplied he did not
                        simply install a basement under the whole house only a small part of which
                        was needed for the heating systems of that time but leaving about half the
                        basement for such uses dropped some of the living quarters to the ground
                        level. In this case the living room thus became a story and a half high.
                        Down half a dozen steps from this level and one was in the billiard room.
                        There was still plenty of space for the heating apparatus.</p>
                    <p>A half story up from the living room were the dining room and the library
                        which thus became a balcony of the Living Room. A story above these are the
                        bed rooms.</p>
                    <p>In this as in most of his buildings he laid out a landscape and planting
                        plan. The location of the dwellings by no means followed the rule of thumb
                        of the usual methods of placing the house on the lot. Many advantages were
                        won in this way.</p>

                    <p>Music is a parallel art in that it appeals to primitive instinct, and is
                        independent of representation of ideas, of literature. Music is, so far, the
                        one great art that has been developed in modern times, because it had kept
                        pace with science, as that has clarified the phenomena of sound, and with
                        the mechanical progress that has opened new avenues of musical expression.</p>
                    <p>Modern science and mechanics offer fully as great advantages to architecture,
                        which have only to be recognized in order properly to apply the Australian
                        motto to this even more important necessary and universal art.</p>

                        call it, and so on. Though all new movements derive from one individual,
                        since ideas arise in a human mind, when that has happened the way is open to
                        all humanity to carry on and develop the work. The foundation has been laid.
                        Louis Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was
                        felt as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully there in the
                        early decades. Personal vanities and claims obstructed it here, especially
                        the widely [publicized] <note>supplied from similar passage at
                        III.10.175)</note> braggadocio of one who did little but talked much.</p>
                    <p>The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every
                        field of life, in every occupation, and taking maximum advantage of its
                        gifts is the task of the designer.</p>
                    <p>The power of a conscientious consideration of all the elements of a problem
                        was brought home to me when I saw the revolution in methods and results that
                        took place when landscape was made a part of architecture. It meant not only
                        a broadening of the view but a positiveness of action arising from the firm
                        foundation of definite facts determining the general scheme before taking up
                        details of internal requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean
                        gardening as an afterthought to a building but means a consideration of the

                    <p>elements before starting to plan or to build. Not only natural conditions but
                        the character of the surrounding buildings have sometimes to be taken
                        advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. And we must consider not the mere
                        personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it
                        is curiously true that a thing to be a real and permanent advantage to one
                        must be an advantage to everyone, just as in the animal or man a sound organ
                        is of vital importance to all the organs. When society in an organism, and
                        the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all since all are
                        interdependent as root, branch, leaf and blossom of tree.</p>
                    <p>My first object lesson was the case of a house the working drawings of which
                        had been completed, and accepted by the owner and the contract let, when it
                        was first subjected to the criticism from this fundamental standpoint, when
                        Griffin entered into partnership with the architect <note>Frank Lloyd
                        Wright</note>. The lot was one next to a two-story flat building with its
                        porch built close to the sidewalk line. Across the street from the flat
                        building was a beautiful park. The house criticized was being set back on
                        the lot as if shrinking from an ugly thing of which it was afraid, leaving
                        the greater part of the grounds to the front, allowing the other building to
                        look over it destroying its privacy and shutting off from the client the
                        delightful view opposite, the home garden dominated by this ugly building.</p>
                    <p>A knowledge of the conditions of the surroundings led to the flat criticism
                        that although the design was charming it was not the right answer, this was
                        not the proper plan for the location, words which meant nothing to the
                        designer who was only an architect, to whom town planning was a closed book.
                        Griffin suggested that the living rooms be elevated above the eyes of the
                        passer-by lifting the basement out of the ground, and that the house instead
                        of being a parallelogram should be ell shaped, and that the whole building
                        be brought forward alongside the flat building and so acting as a screen</p>

                    <p>around the whole house giving it a real dignity worthy of the discipline he
                        had been under with Mr. Sullivan.</p>
                    <p>While this was going on I was told to make sketches for an abstract 2 story 3
                        bed-room house which I did. This gave me an experience of why the Chinese
                        tipped up the overhanging eaves though expressed in modern scientific terms
                        of forces of gravity instead of demons - a reality in whatever terms
                        expressed. I guess I was never a conformist. Any <note>Anyway?</note> it was
                        a cruciform plan. Later on when I had left the office and Griffin was in
                        partnership there an amazing thing happened. He told me one day several
                        years later of his first experience there. A residential job had come into
                        the office and the two men went into a competition for it. He mentioned the
                        name of the client and I was wide-eyed thinking he was going to say he won
                        it. Why otherwise should a man be telling me about it. But he said he lost,
                        and I laughed and told him that house had been built exactly in accordance
                        with my design - that first one. It was a revolutionary design, abandoning
                        the universal parallelogram, T shaped, and center reception entrance hall
                        dropped to ground level. His losing in that competition was doubtless a
                        unique experience in that office. His revolutionizing of the work in that
                        office was first expressed in the <note>Frank W.</note> Thomas House.</p>
                    <p>Later this architect went abroad. He asked me to take over the office for
                        him. I refused. But after he had gone Mr. <note>Herman</note> von Holst who
                        had taken over asked me to join him so I did on a definite arrangement that
                        I should have control of the designing, that suited him. When the absent
                        architect didn't bother to answer anything that was sent over to him the
                        relations were broken and I entered into a partnership with von Holst and
                        Fyfe. For that period I had great fun designing.</p>
                    <p>While the construction of the home of Henry Ford was being carried on,
                        presentation sketches were made for Mr. <note>C.H.</note> Wills. At this
                        period I too followed the Japanese feeling. It was not till a short time
                        afterward, when I entered Griffin's office, that I realized the difference.</p>

                    <p>In this case also Griffin built a basement for furnace and storage under the
                        Living Room only. The other half of the living floor - dining room, kitchen
                        and veranda, were built solid on the ground, proper construction installed
                        to prevent seepage of moisture. Turning to the west on entering one enters
                        this suite.</p>
                    <p>A half flight of steps to the right takes one to the lofty living room with
                        its perforated screen frieze above window and door head height encircling
                        three sides of the Living Room and forming the window screen for the bed
                        rooms.</p>
                    <p>A half flight from the Living Room takes one to the music balcony on which

                    <p>This is a minimum cost house. It has corner fenestration but beautiful
                        instead of the teeth knocked out which has so widely followed this type of
                        construction which substitutes tensile for compressive members so universal
                        before. This with all its ornament is as cheap as the usual barren examples
                        as was proved in the incinerator in Sydney, Australia, where the whole wall
                        is highly ornamented.</p>

                        projected for a neighborhood group of houses being planned for the 9 acre
                        rectangular plot of land lying just West of the New Trier High School
                        Community Center in Winnetka, Illinois. This house is one of the group to be
                        started at the break of Spring that will comprise the first installment of a
                        series of 36 small fireproof cottages that represent an attempt to
                        demonstrate some of the advantages of recently developed practical and
                        esthetic principles for the layout of small home groups.</p>
                    <p>Among the advantages, besides the generally recognized saving in wholesale
                        building operation, especially for fireproof structures are:- Greater
                        utilization of the ground and openness of view, first through clustering
                        together and thus concentrating the public thoroughfare and service
                        functions of the house to leave wider, freer ground space for private use
                        and preservation of the rural character; secondly, by arranging the clusters
                        with respect to each other to give vistas from all principal rooms extending
                        over at least two unobstructed lots in each direction; thirdly, in the
                        combination and composition of units of simplest forms, single little
                        houses, into picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and
                        hedges with tree and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house, that
                        alone would be an unmitigated box, into an appropriate link of a rambling,
                        cozy, private community home of separate wings, bays and pavilions, such as
                        might constitute the dream of the useless overgrown Castle in Spain toward
                        which each of us is so often selfishly and aristocratically inclined.</p>
                    <p>The site of this one isolated house unit that will mark the starting point
                        terminates an extension of Alles Road eastward to a small circular park
                        which will effect this road's diversion to the north and also form the
                        northern terminal of Bertling Lane that is</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 24 ====]</p>
                    <p>to run southward to a similar circle planting screening its south entrance
                        from Winnetka Avenue.</p>
                    <p>Located focally this house can take on a somewhat more decorative and special
                        character than is intended for the remaining ones. In its function of a high
                        Studio Living Room, it is afforded some distinction, and perforated concrete
                        geometric tracery for the frieze windows of opalescent color glass for this
                        room, and the conservatory as well, gives the single motive that is utilized
                        to characterize the whole design. Not only outside is the characterization
                        intended but inside also in fireplace, sideboard and grilles, rendered
                        possible through the elimination of wood trim or fixtures, wood being used
                        only for movable or portable appurtenances.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps thus a cottage with only two bedrooms may be able to dispense with
                        any want of a maid's room and the responsibility of a household
                        organization. At any rate, the office organization in Chicago in which both
                        members of this household are involved is considered enough to absorb all
                        available energy in that direction. And it is now becoming the conviction of
                        many others that conservation of freedom must lead to the simplest house
                        units and construction with retinues the smallest compatible with the size
                        of the family, a standard simpler by far than prevalent types and perhaps
                        approximating the completely tile-outfitted lunch rooms that serve the
                        cleanest food with the least help and at the lowest price and the greatest
                        profit.</p>

                    <p>THE NATURAL HOUSE . Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>When we have become satiated with precepts and principles, and examples
                        illustrative thereof, architectural or indeed pertaining to art in general,
                        we are ripe for an appreciation of the real thing which exists not because
                        of these essentials but through and constrained by them.</p>
                    <p>They are not what makes art fresh, invigorating, inspiring; they do not endow
                        it with character. Art principles are analogous to scientific principles,
                        they tell much of the body, the husk of the thing but they balk at the life,
                        yet it is with the introduction of life that the thing becomes real and
                        natural.</p>
                    <p>With nature and art as with human nature the absorbing feature is the heart -
                        the soul. We are attracted by an ideal behind, the perception of which is,
                        perhaps, subconscious but at any rate there, and our enjoyment is measured
                        by the keenness of the perception. It is the case of the yellow primrose.</p>
                    <p>Say we call this aesthetic intuition or feeling, because it is independent of
                        the intellect in the same way that we know ethical feeling, that of right
                        and wrong, to be. A higher than mortal development may show a continuity in
                        the fields of physical and meta-physical observation but for the present we
                        must admit ignorance of the relationship and it is nothing less than
                        presumption in the analytical art critic to content himself with picking
                        flaws and extolling conformation to his own rules, unless his own
                        preconceptions, through his absorption in these details, become as totally
                        oblivious to the presence or absence of life as he is incapable of producing
                        the beautiful himself.</p>
                    <p>A resort to taste however is not at all implied unless that of an absolutely
                        free and open commune with nature is meant; for ordinarily taste is a more
                        or less self conscious emanation from inward, or a creature of habit
                        reducible to one's own or another's previous</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 28 ====]</p>
                    <p>sanction, the reverse of susceptibility to the spirit of nature or man's
                        translation of that spirit - art.</p>
                    <p>Whatever it is that takes hold of us when we are stirred by the storm,
                        solaced by the serenity of calm, awed by the grandeur of the mountain,
                        whatever it is that influences us in nature's various moods, that, or some
                        phase or it, the artist must have when he expresses himself in a poem, a
                        painting, a symphony or a house, and that, if he has succeeded in expressing
                        himself, is what the witness will feel unless he is fenced about with
                        custom, self-sufficing learning or with prejudice.</p>
                    <p>Is it a coincidence then that art has been in history the handmaiden of
                        religion? Not when we realize the intimate relationship as to source and
                        manner of conception. And so has the architect preached as long as his
                        religion remained heart-felt and heart-enacted, rather than authority
                        inspired and authority enacted. And so was his art then the highest
                        expression of the "sermon in stones." </p>
                    <p>Now if this were an exposition of art what has been said would be the climax
                        but to connect it with The Natural House is only to pass from general to
                        particular.</p>
                    <p>To begin with, such an understanding of art establishes the necessary
                        conditions of its teaching and practice. Only for the youngest then can that
                        education rest on authority. No rules, no doctrines, can be accepted after
                        maturity until tested by the inward initiative or creative force, the
                        idealistic feeling that we have been talking about.</p>
                    <p>As with the spirit of a New Testament in the heart, the Decalogue may safely
                        be forgotten (though history seems to show that in undeveloped periods
                        before the dawn of democracy, the latter is useful); thus to affirm that
                        sincerity, thoroughness, restraint, etc., etc., are essentials, or to learn
                        the necessity of regard for consistency of scale and motif, for grace of
                        proportion, for the</p>
                    <pb n="29"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 29 ====]</p>
                    <p>degrees of variety in unity, repetition and contrast; or to imbibe the 33
                        aphorisms of <note>John</note> Ruskin's Seven Lamps of Architecture or the
                        dicta of any seer, is to deal laboriously with the numerous observations of
                        the mind-resultant, one soul attitude, the receptive susceptible one toward
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>Alone familiarity with these observations and deductions may beget talent,
                        the faculty for the simulation of art; but if from the attributes we are
                        finally led to the sources of power we are no farther than we might have
                        been at the outset had we sought nature direct.</p>
                    <p>When, however, whether deductively or inductively, the intimacy with nature
                        and love or creatures' spirit have been acquired, technical proficiency
                        (knowledge of the tools and materials and facility in their use) will govern
                        and limit the translation and perpetuation of her impressions.</p>
                    <p>To recognize a work of art then do not proceed to try it by the formulae of
                        the teachers with whom you happen to have been thrown for art, again like
                        religion, is too vital a feature of human experience to be dependent for its
                        comprehension on the word of mouth of man from generation to generation or
                        to be withheld from a large part if the world through chance failure to meet
                        its teacher.</p>
                    <p>Forget these limitations of the mind, become unconscious of self for the time
                        being as when in contact with nature's own handiwork and if under these
                        circumstances no similar message is received the art is wanting though no
                        defect in principle can be detected.</p>
                    <p>Now a house in so far as it is artistic differs from other artistic
                        expression nowise but in the media used. The same ideal, the same sort of
                        feeling must be behind its conception and, in recognizing this, perhaps we
                        will look for more in the architecture and be less exacting of the
                        architect. We can be satisfied with little conformation to our own views as
                        well as with less</p>

                    <p>The half story scheme so frequently used by Griffin is not conspicuously
                        apparent in the elevations for the formality of the design is never
                        sacrificed, so this economical and space saving method though so frequently
                        used by him has rarely been used by the profession.</p>
                    <p>This method enabled him to make good use also of differences of levels of the
                        grounds. It was never permitted to interfere with the dignity of the
                        exterior.</p>

                    <p>comprehensive statement of his reasons which it may tax his wits to concoct.</p>
                    <p>Just as soon as the love of the work is dispelled and the designer begins to
                        produce listlessly or mechanically, however carefully, the possibilities of
                        the production are destroyed, there is no life in it. The builder of the
                        natural house requires from the outset a degree of relief from exactions and
                        distractions, a freedom of action which he rarely gets.</p>
                    <p>Here is a condition that chiefly accounts for the all but total absence from
                        this field of art (otherwise the broadest and most influential of all) of
                        true creative artists. In other branches of art generally popular judgment,
                        however perverted and unjust it is, is at least withheld for the result but
                        here it is imposed in restriction at the initiative through a false
                        assumption of conflicting interests. Once let the judgment of the people be
                        shifted to finished creations and the choice of design based strictly
                        thereon, house designing will invite serious, profound effort which it needs
                        and merits to instill into it the intuition which the very word "create"
                        implies.</p>

                    <p>rather than by purely architectural aspiration, simply because when serious
                        attempt at architecture has been made it has not meant art but learning,
                        cleverness, talent or ignorant striving for these. Hence for comparison of
                        results the general conclusion has been that in houses practical
                        considerations should govern, that house building, furniture building,
                        should be striven for rather than house and furniture architecture.</p>
                    <p>Of course use of the most available materials and methods of construction
                        applying them to the problem in hand in the most obvious and seemingly
                        straightforward way cannot fail to partake of a limited feeling of the
                        designer for his work, but, a deeper insight, a desire for the utmost
                        attainable, is apt to manifest itself independently of local brands or
                        crudely developed productions.</p>
                    <p>It is in <note>"in" crossed out in N-YHS</note> lazy neglect of an
                        opportunity not to reach for an ideal which will be held by apparent
                        limitations only after every effort to overcome them has been exhausted.
                        Thus the Natural House will never glory in crudities nor in simplicity, nor
                        in directions "per se" but only as these tend to an end by which alone they
                        can be judged and which alone is the life of the house. When we come to this
                        ideal, though, we will be sure that it, in the house, is the ideal of the
                        domestic life for which it stands. If that ideal is tranquility to the
                        extent of exclusiveness or hospitality to all the lengths of festivity or of
                        any of the gradations between, it must be that particular one to which it
                        must adapt itself which should appear to us.</p>
                    <p>For our part possibly the restful, the peaceful but statically vigorous
                        character appeals most strongly as I believe it does to the most of the
                        peoples when the country itself is mild in aspect, the climate erratic
                        though temperate. On the other hand where nature in the low tropics seems
                        more restful and unambitious it may be assumed that man and his habitation
                        partakes of the unambitious, and while the dwellings of the Tyrolese I fancy
                        reflect the rugged mountaineers</p>

                    <p>as well as the tumultuous environment.</p>

                    <p>LOUIS SULLIVAN . GRIFFIN HIS SUCCESSOR<hi rend="ul"/></p>
                    <p>Mr. Griffin says:- "Louis Sullivan probably broke away from the old
                        traditions when he left the Beaux Arts, if not before. He made his first
                        declaration, presented his thesis, in 1884 when he read his "Inspiration"
                        before an assembly of brother craftsmen. Since that time he has been the
                        recognized leader in the effort of the best and brightest among the
                        profession to "draw the thing as he sees it for the God of things as they
                        are," though it was not until 1893 that a broad, illuminating and
                        progressive conception of his art was forced upon the attention of the world
                        by his Transportation Building with its polychromatic doorway at the
                        Columbian Exposition.</p>
                    <p>The public is at last realizing the logic of the principles for which Mr.
                        Sullivan labored and which the best among those of lesser years and fresh
                        enthusiasm have sought to develop. It does not mean that a discovery has
                        been made and old principles in form and ethics turned topsy turvy. It does
                        mean that a majority of those who believe that "form should follow function"
                        and that "Progress should go before precedent" have good ground for so
                        believing. The principle is being worked out by architects everywhere.
                        Vitally active, and sanely pursued in the Middle West of the United States,
                        it is also the inspiring motive on its Western border, and on the continent
                        from Finland to Buda-Pest <note>i.e., Budapest</note>. It is the source of
                        the most interesting architectural work.</p>
                    <p>Even among the conventional and the traditional its logic appeals and draws.
                        It is the basis of thought as it will be of action of men whose talent and
                        sane discrimination guide them in their professional work."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Griffin, Mr. Sullivan's successor in creative thinking, in these fields
                        awakened the community to the necessity of considering simultaneously the
                        problem of building and environment near and far. It now becomes clear that
                        these cannot be practiced as separate professions, architect or town
                        planner, but only as one indivisible profession - landscape architecture. It
                        is time our Universities woke up to this fact and made one subject of these
                        for united they</p>
                    <pb n="38"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 38 ====]</p>
                    <p>stand and divided they fail.</p>
                    <p>Canberra - the only modern city in the world - Alpha &amp; Omega</p>
                    <p>There is an error which derives from our present day habit of being satisfied
                        with rational thinking which starts from a premise and follows a straight
                        line to a conclusion. This method of thinking leaves out all the
                        multifarious facts that do not fall into that straight line. This method of
                        thinking is or can be purely mechanical and is the idol of our time. More
                        living thinking follows curves, sometimes very devious curves, for it takes
                        note of facts and does not rest satisfied with theories. Facts lie outside
                        of reason. The Gods do not use that method of thinking.</p>
                    <p>Creative thinking goes direct to totalities and works from wholes to
                        particulars. The Greeks conceived the totality of nature - earth, water,
                        air, fire, its four conditions of matter brought into existence by the
                        formative forces revealed recently in the smashing of matter in the resorts
                            <note>retorts?</note> revealing astounding forces. The Greeks expressed
                        their inspiration in the fourness <note>i.e., four-ness</note> of their
                        temples.</p>
                    <p>Every true revolutionary is a creative thinker, not a destroyer but a
                        builder. Thus the French revolution was not a revolution but an upheaval
                        substituting one control for another. The same is true of Bolshevism in
                        Russia and so with most community upheavals. There was however in France
                        someone who had a creative imagination when he cried out for liberty,
                        equity, fraternity. But the vision faded. No one did anything about it. The
                        concept of humanity as having three functions was never translated into
                        deeds. So we continue to have totalitarian governments and continue to have
                        upheavals in our communities but nowhere yet the revolution of transforming
                        our communities from the totalitarianism form to a threefold form to meet
                        these three needs of humanity. Yet it is axiomatic that if an entity has
                        three functions to fulfill it must have three organs to fulfill them. This
                        revolution calls for no upheaval, merely constructive deeds.</p>
                    <pb n="39"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 39 ====]</p>
                    <p>So with Architecture and Landscape Architecture (Town Planning is a most
                        unfortunate title for one lot is as important as a city) a simultaneous
                        consideration of all the elements is requisite, is essential. In modern
                        times, say since the 15th century, Griffin was the creative thinker in this
                        field. As a boy in school he laid down the basic principles of occupation
                        &amp; distribution. Shortly after graduation he laid down a town plan
                        for a Chinese client <note>Wong Kai Kah (1860-1906)?</note> of a city
                            <note>an addition to Shanghai?</note> to be built in China.</p>
                    <p>It was not long before the opportunity he had been waiting for presented
                        itself - Australia was calling for designs for their Federal Capital city.
                        He won the prize and was made Federal Director of Design &amp;
                        Construction of Canberra. When after six years he resigned a law was passed
                        that no deviation from the plan could be made except by an act of
                        Parliament. Since a city is a thing that grows through the decades and
                        centuries Griffin never expected to see more than a small part in actual
                        execution but, since governments don't have to pay interest on the money
                        they expend, Canberra is now one of the sights of the world the roads of a
                        whole city and its suburbs laid out and constructed on the ground the whole
                        of which can be seen from the neighboring heights, and the citizens are
                        saying that through that great conception of Mr. Griffin's the soul of
                        Australia is developing.</p>

                    <p>LAND PLANNING</p>
                    <p>That land planning was the essence or Griffin's profession, even the land
                        planning of a single lot, is illustrated in Volume III, The Federal Battle,
                        where photographs of his community plans form the Initials for its 24
                        chapters. The full flowering of his work came in the last year of his life
                        which was spent in India with which country America should be closely bound
                        through mutual (individual not imperial) interests. Each has much to gain
                        from the other whereas Europe will doubtless have to stand apart for a long
                        time to come.</p>
                    <p>We must realize that architecture and community planning are inseparable and
                        that, for all the great genius of Sullivan, the school which grew from his
                        inspiration died aborning so to speak until Griffin united community
                        planning with it. The Chicago school died not only because of the cancer
                        sore in it - one <note>Frank Lloyd Wright?</note> who originated very little
                        but spent most of his time claiming everything and swiping everything even
                        using an Australian <note>George A. Taylor?</note> who contacted him on a
                        trip through America and thenceforth forwarded to him what he could get hold
                        of of Griffin's work as for instance an imitation knitlock house in
                        California and solid floor on the ground which immediately began to leak and
                        had to be done all over again. The square tiles of the walls had no
                        structural raison d'etre. Purely another case of "I want to be the lion
                        too."</p>
                    <p>The development of individuals as well as of the arts, especially
                        Architecture, depends on the structure of the community and so long as
                        private ownership of land continues the community can have no structure. We
                        can't even get a quarter section of Chicago to prove that through its
                        treatment the community can become a healthy, happy organism with no child
                        delinquency.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately from some points of view, Griffin's appointment as Director of
                        Design and Construction of Canberra took us to Australia before this
                        revolutionary design, Own House, Trier Center, could be carried into effect.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 ====]</p>
                    <p>This was in 1913. Griffin was already in Australia when the working drawings
                            <note>N-YHS handwritten addition: "of one of the dwellings - Own House .
                            Trier Center -</note> were being made. I handed the plans to the
                        engineer in our office, a fine engineer he was too, to work out the
                        structural steel. He came to me presently saying scornfully that building
                        couldn't be built, it had no stamina, couldn't take the horizontal stresses.
                        You will notice that it has two pairs of heavy piers. The rest of the house
                        is two bays, all windows, the glass house par excellence. The concrete piers
                        terminate either end of the stair passages. I replied - "Do you mean to tell
                        me those great heavy piers can't hold up that little house?" "But," he said,
                        "there is no weight in the corners to take up the horizontal stresses." "But
                        surely," said I, "it is possible by engineering means to take up such
                        stresses by tension members as well as by compression members." He returned
                        to his desk and tied the bays into the piers. This is an interesting
                        instance of the basic difference between the engineer and the architect. The
                        engineer thinks in terms of the past - "It isn't done." The architect thinks
                        in terms of the future - "It has to be done."</p>
                    <p>There is an inclination in our mechanical minded communities to give the
                        credit in the building of the first skyscraper, the Auditorium Building, on
                        a swamp, by the firm of Adler &amp; Sullivan to Adler, the engineer.
                        Quite false. If Adler had refused to solve the problem for his design he
                            <note>N-YHS handwritten addition: "Sullivan"</note> would have solved it
                        himself - a skyscraper with no foundation to stand on too it was, built on a
                        swamp, on a raft <note>N-YHS handwritten addition: ", the precursor of

                    <p>In this - Our Own House - widely publicized at the time, is the prototype of
                        the glass office building which came before the public a quarter of a
                        century later. A creative concept once attained grows and spreads. It is a
                        seed planted.</p>
                    <p>The house is germinal in other ways, a half story house. It antedated present
                        methods of heating but why waste a whole story on furnace and fuel. So the
                        basement is limited to the area of the</p>
                    <pb n="44"/>

                    <p>living room which is a story and a half <note>N-YHS handwritten addition:
                            "high"</note> above it. The perforated concrete tracery frieze around
                        the living room continues around the whole house forming the entire
                        fenestration of the bed rooms making them secluded even when the windows
                        back of them are open. This form of wall is not expensive, the pattern,
                        repeated, brings the cost to that of a normal wall but in feeling it is
                        exquisite. We have an instance in an incinerator building in Australia where
                        the whole outer wall is ornament in rich variety to illustrate the 4 ethers,
                        the formative forces - warmth, light, sound and life (or magnetism) - and it
                        cost no more to build than an ordinary brick building. The structural units
                        are larger than bricks making the erection economical - the Pyrmont
                        Incinerator.</p>
                    <p>In the Griffin house, solid on the ground, advantageous in every respect, are
                        conservatory, dining room and kitchen. Up a half a story, the lofty studio
                        living room; the hall of the bedrooms a half story above forming a balcony
                        for the assembly room. Here piano and orchestra can play leaving the floor
                        space clear for dance and other entertainment.</p>
                    <p>This house closes the vista as you enter Trier Center by Alles Street. The
                        connection with Bertling Lane is a circular safety park which could be
                        treated as shown with a pool or with a fountain for dog, horse and man.</p>

                    <p>By means of co-terminating restrictions in the title deeds it is possible to
                        maintain the community ideal of this development so long as this particular
                        community wishes starting with permanent buildings and garden settings
                        completed in all cases and with families who desire the open and
                        co-operative treatment of the garden area we may feel assured that these
                        possibilities will be developed to their utmost. No outbuildings are to be
                        allowed outside restricted court garden limits indicated in the original
                        plan. Hedges and wire fences will be the reliance for separating the private
                        gardens so far as isolation is desired by any families. The low walls
                        indicating the demarcation between private garden and public forecourts are
                        part of the original construction and an important factor in unifying the
                        treatment of the thoroughfare spaces and bringing down in height the
                        connecting with the earth of the building features of the whole garden

                        each direction are closed by buildings which will be correspondingly
                        accentuated in their architectural relationship with the remaining houses,
                        as in the case of the first one of the herewith illustrated. Such necessary
                        accessories as light fixtures will be made appropriate garden elements, a

                    <p>TRIER CENTER . Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>In the effort to make our communities attractive the most important element
                        is the home of the average man on the average lot and its placing in
                        relation to the natural scenery. All other structures, however impressive in
                        themselves, are incidental to the aggregate multitude of homes and have
                        small effect comparatively.</p>
                    <p>The very littleness and multiplicity of the units of this character that go
                        to make up the effect necessitates the greatest care in keeping each
                        modestly unobtrusive in itself and in doing all it can to avert the disaster
                        of monotonous staccato repetition of self-sufficient pettiness on the one
                        hand or, on the other, the confusion from rival efforts of each to distract
                        the attention from the others and to attract it to itself after the manner
                        of the old-time hackman <note>hackney carriage driver</note> of rival hotels
                        at the station or the vulgar, intermittent flashing signs of a "Great White
                        Way."</p>
                    <p>Subordination - The types of individual detached structures that will make
                        the country suburb restful must tend toward subordinating itself to the
                        fullest extent possible to the native beauty and verdure which its invasion
                        on other terms utterly destroys. Here is a case where a block frontage made
                        up of wood and glade of especial attractiveness has previously been
                        undisturbed and where this house is the first step in an attempt to preserve
                        the natural characteristics of these features without reducing the
                        proportion of building to grounds that real estate conditions in the
                        community require, since the buildings are being erected for the market.</p>
                    <p>Local conditions demanding a high basement rendered reasonable a high-capped
                        terrace connection for the proposed structures, helping to tie them into one
                        group as well as to mitigate the otherwise emphatic height of each
                        structure.</p>
                    <p>Material - A single material and treatment will serve to further tie them
                        together and as the material which needs least paraphernalia of protective
                        features or connective expedients the one nearest and</p>
                    <pb n="51"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 51 ====]</p>
                    <p>most resembling Nature's solid rock, of itself withstanding the storm and
                        capable of supporting a bower of vine, shrub and flower, monolithic concrete
                        has been adopted.</p>
                    <p>For satisfactory design in this material, as in any other, the possibilities
                        of its nature must be sought directly and developed accordingly with
                        consistency avoiding irrelevancies and superfluities. Concrete may be
                        assumed to demand a simple way of construction, with repeated use of the
                        same molds and with large masses contrasting with plastic decorative
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>Walls accentuated with projecting overhanging vine garden features and a
                        concrete roof that will support grass and flower plots are made the most of
                        as a roof terrace garden surrounding a second story veranda helping to
                        afford to that necessary contrivance the maximum enjoyment by day, in its
                        airy station looking out in the four directions and catching the slightest
                        breeze, and of rest at night in isolation and privacy from the remainder of
                        the house as well as from the grounds.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the elevated veranda of the house to the south, next to be built,
                        will be immediately accessible from the entrance for day use and privately
                        from the bedrooms for the purpose of outdoor sleeping compartment, though in
                        other respects and plans it will be as radically different as the respective
                        sites - the first in the open and the second in the woods.</p>
                    <p>Arrangements - In the house illustrated, the rooms are on one floor, giving
                        the advantage of a flat for ease of housekeeping. The Stairway and hall are
                        so grouped <note>N-YHS substitutes "arranged"</note> as to give independence
                        of access to the various departments - living rooms, kitchen, sleeping
                        quarters. The whole of a flat roof is utilized. The stairway is so placed as
                        to make the roof accessible from out of doors or from any of the departments
                        below without passing through any other, while by the shifting of one hall
                        door between the two casings provided for it, one important isolated room
                        can be transformed from a retired bedroom into a</p>
                    <pb n="52"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 52 ====]</p>
                    <p>reception room, library or office at the entrance. By a somewhat similar
                        change at the rear hall a maid's room can be made to accommodate part of the
                        family. These varied adaptations are especially important for investment
                        houses where exact family requirements can least of all be specified.</p>
                    <p>Interest Aroused - That there is no lack of keen interest and delight in a
                        straightforward attempt at the solution of an architectural problem is
                        evidenced by the procession of people who come to visit any such building in
                        the course of its construction, individuals frequently returning week after
                        week to watch its various stages of progress; and also by the warm affection
                        and watchful care of occupants after completion. It seems also to be the
                        fact that such a house built for sale can be disposed of with facility. The
                        residences are sometimes sold long before completion, while still crude for
                        lack of all those features which add so much to the grace of a finished
                        structure.</p>
                    <p>The unfortunate conception that we can give style to our buildings by copying
                        motives developed in former times has had a most deadening influence on our
                        builders and has resulted in buildings so lacking in interest that we have
                        curiously been led to believe that our people are lacking in appreciation of
                        art. The contrary is the case. The refusal of people to be interested in the
                        meaningless, borrowed trappings of former civilizations in an effort to
                        pretend quality and culture shows accuracy of judgment and a true sense or
                        the beautiful, for art consists only in doing well what needs to be done.</p>

                        minimum cost houses dropped from Griffin's pencil but unfortunately his call
                        to Australia prevented them from being carried into execution. They all gave
                        more to the client than the routine cheap houses and all were beautiful and

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>This house is one of a series of thirty-five small fireproof cottages that
                        represent an attempt to demonstrate some of the advantages of recently
                        developed practical and esthetic principles for the layout of small home
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>Among these advantages, besides the generally saving in wholesale building
                        operation, especially for fireproof structures, are: Greater utilization of
                        the ground and openness of view, first through clustering together and thus
                        concentrating the public thoroughfare and service functions of the house to
                        leave wider, freer ground space for private use and preservation of the
                        rural character; secondly, by arranging the clusters with respect to each
                        other to give vistas from all principal rooms extending over at least two
                        unobstructed lots in each direction; thirdly, in the combination and
                        composition of units of simplest form, single little houses, into
                        picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and hedges with tree
                        and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house that alone would be an
                        unmitigated box into an appropriate link of a rambling, cozy, private
                        community home of separated wings, bays and pavilions, such as might
                        constitute the dream of the useless overgrown Castle in Spain toward which
                        each of us is so often selfishly and aristocratically inclined.</p>
                    <p>In this unit house we have a large assembly room serving for living and
                        dining. The floor is solid on the ground. The veranda is on the roof. The
                        plan shows an extension of the same type with bed room and bath added to the
                        veranda on the roof which is partly open garden and partly roofed with a
                        desk at the window sill height.</p>

                    <p>That there may be no loss and may be much gain in abandoning the so-called
                        artistic method and rationally accepting conditions and scheming treatment
                        in accordance, was interestingly illustrated in the first typical group plan
                        I saw worked out - in arrangement of four houses to a block the one
                        arrangement by Frank Lloyd Wright leaving practically the whole of the yards
                        to the street frontage, giving no privacy and necessitating long drives and
                        walks for access to the houses. The disadvantage of such an arrangement was
                        recently again brought to mind while passing through Victoria British
                        Columbia, when a friend stated that she could not be induced to build her
                        home in a district considered to be the most attractive in the city and
                        supposedly ideally laid out but where, as she expressed it, all your living
                        was in the eye of the public.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="ul">FOUR HOUSES TO A BLOCK</hi> . HOUSES IN CENTER</p>
                    <p>As we go further from a metropolis we may have larger acreage, say 4
                        allotments to a block. At one time this problem was set for a group of
                        architects to consider as a generalization. One, thinking entirely from the
                        picture point of view, established as a type the placing of the houses back
                        in the center of the block. That there may be no loss but much gain in
                        abandoning the so-called idealistic method and rationally accepting
                        conditions and scheming treatment in accordance can be shown by a
                        comparison.</p>
                    <p>With the houses grouped in the center, practically the whole of the yards are
                        opened to the street giving no privacy and necessitating long drives and
                        walks for access to the houses. Thinking bearing <note>N-YHS substitutes:
                            "Bringing to bear"</note> an appreciation of outdoor conditions led
                        Griffin to a reversal of this four house scheme, building on the corners
                        instead of the center of the blocks. You will see the advantage of looking
                        at the problem not simply as an architect but as landscape architect. For
                        the architectural effect we still get at each street intersection, and where
                        it will be much more effective for the occupants themselves as well as for
                        community effect, for a consciousness of humanity adds greatly to the

                        enriching nature.</p>
                    <p>No private roadways are necessary for access, saving expense and adding space
                        for gardens and playgrounds. The temptation for men and children to cut
                        across the corners of the lot is eliminated. By placing the service quarters
                        next the street the desirable outlooks are reserved for the living rooms of
                        the house, none of the private space being required for service quarters
                        which are amply provided with light and air from the public streets. The
                        living rooms thus look upon a private stretch unintersected by roadway, an
                        effective park for use in common if so desired or, if subdivided by hedges,
                        according utter privacy for each family while still maintaining the quite
                        parklike character and offering opportunity for the play of the young people
                        away from the danger and distractions of the street. Since both house and
                        nature are three dimensional, the feeling of spaciousness is their prime
                        requisite.</p>
                    <p>Special conditions may, of course, call for variations of this arrangement.</p>

                    <p>To improve our conditions requires change. The question is, what changes in
                        our methods will open the doors to the greatest and most rapid progress?</p>
                    <p>In reviewing European communities we find the greatest progress in
                        architecture, the nearest approach to solution of domestic requirements is
                        found in that community which has fewest governmental restrictions.</p>
                    <p>If an architect is to solve a problem, he must be free to break away from
                        established methods. Architects should therefore be responsible for their
                        work and that responsibility should not be shifted.</p>
                    <p>Especially inefficient is the removing of that responsibility to a Board by
                        which system it is impossible to locate responsibility. Experience shows
                        that an architect who attempts to do a model house is seriously hampered and
                        usually totally prevented from carrying out such work, because the very fact
                        that it is different means that it will not be passed by the authorities in
                        control. This consequence is the very essence of the system of governmental
                        restriction of building, since bodies politically constituted can lay down
                        rules only by reference to and in accordance with what has been done and is
                        the custom to do.</p>
                    <p>We find, therefore, that we are compelled to build residences that are too
                        large, too cumbersome, and too expensive.</p>
                    <p>The net result when individual family accommodation cannot be provided at
                        cost within means of those to be provided, is that these are overcrowded in
                        the accommodation allowed.</p>
                    <p>The real problem of course is not concerned with better housing which is
                        beyond the means of the people concerned, but with making opportunity for
                        sufficient means for these people to have proper housing. As long as the
                        land owners can raise the rent to correspond with the improvement of any
                        locality, there is small advantage to be derived from our efforts.</p>

                        individuals is the world. What the Gods have given us we are under
                        obligation to share with humanity, with the world. It is for us to free
                        humanity for we alone are free human beings. Only individuals can do this
                        for the Christ broke up all peoples and races giving the individual spirit,
                        the Ego, the Light, to every man in the world. Democracy is as important as
                        the smashing of the atom. Unless democracy is applied to humanity as a whole
                        the power released in the atom will become demonic and destroy humanity.
                        Only in America has it been experienced. In democracy <note>N-YHS adds:
                            "found only in the United States"</note> the Spirit of the Human is
                        released as in Atom-smashing the Spirit of Matter is released.</p>
                    <p>In this physical experiment the 20th century has fulfilled its basic task
                        with the dual law - that of up and down, inside and outside, force and form
                        - where, in the realm of manifestation, you can't have one without the
                        other. The reality of matter is form and nothing else. The smashing of the
                        atomic form frees the spiritual forces of matter. They are not things that
                        can be weighed and measured except in terms of force. Thus do the Orient and
                        the Occident meet.</p>
                    <p>The reason why America won the war and will win the peace is because the
                        strength and power of the individual is recognized and given full play. The
                        first step was to escape from the rest of the world - the Eastern world, the
                        Asiatic continent of which Europe is but a state and to establish a
                        community organization in which no individual nor group had <hi rend="ul"
                            >power</hi> over another, a community whose basic principle is EQUITY.
                        There are many lovely and wonderful people elsewhere in the world but they
                        are helpless. Migration to America frees their spiritual forces. That is the
                        magic of the United States. The founders of the Congressional System smashed
                        the political atom which holds the rest of humanity in bondage.</p>

                    <p>The immediate task of Americans now is to go out individually to every part

                        life of the past. In many cases that is now our only approach and, where
                        archeology and history have afforded a check, I like to believe that
                        buildings convey the most truth of the mental and spiritual states of
                        various peoples and times. In the aggregate the architecture of a people
                        certainly represents the greatest amount of human effort applied to the
                        realization of purely human ideals.</p>
                    <p>MODERN ARCHITECTURE LIFELESS</p>
                    <p>In our own times, of which we have of course the most complete history, the
                        decadence, almost atrophy, of the art of architecture since the Middle Ages
                        in Europe points to some analysis of life as necessary to the formulation of
                        the problems of building. Roman history offers the only parallel to such
                        loss of the creative instincts and the substitution of imitation and
                        ostentation for sincerity and invention. Those times were sordid and
                        prepared the doom of Western civilization. With similar failure in our
                        architectural expression for over 400 years it may be worth our while to
                        consider why our ideals are lacking constructive results in the one art that
                        is based on common and general impulse.</p>
                    <p>The great significance of the architecture of our times is that it is not
                        only for the man in the street but necessarily by and of the average man.
                        Alone amongst the arts, Architecture denies to the genius of the man ahead
                        of his time the very forms, colors, notes or words with which to express his
                        ideals or to blaze a path for the masses. The masses must painfully grope
                        out their own uncertain way. Even the artisan has little chance to put on
                        the extra touch or express his feeling in his work because he is limited to
                        the market</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 67 ====]</p>
                    <p>which only a mass popularity will afford for economic mass production. We
                        cannot get away from the fact that we are immersed in a democratic and
                        economic age, democratic probably because economic.</p>
                    <p>LIFE DOMINATED BY SCIENCE</p>
                    <p>For 300 years intellectual curiosity has absorbed the best part of man's
                        energy. The results of scientific investigation have been so progressively
                        startling that we have become more and more mentally conceited, individually
                        detached from the world as a creation, from our own sub-conscious minds,
                        from the common universal mind and from religion and art in which the
                        emotions play as great a part as the intellect.</p>
                    <p>Robbed of the aggressive and inquisitive independent intellect the cults of
                        religion and art have deteriorated to timid routine sanctioned by orders and
                        precedents and controlled by rules and regulations, and relying on these
                        sanctions and rules for the economic support of the scientific and practical
                        man who is not interested in the intangible or the unproven.</p>
                    <p>The dwindling of creative architecture and the deprivation of new beauties on
                        the earth for so many years is not the worst side of the picture, for there
                        has been active destruction going on - not only in the inevitable breaking
                        up of old idols but in the wanton despoliation of nature. Nature has come to
                        be regarded primarily as a field of economic exploitation, and its beauty
                        considered only in the few cases where this beauty can be exploited
                        profitably.</p>
                    <p>In a world dominated by individual curiosity, success and arrogance the
                        marvels of inorganic and organic creation are being ruthlessly converted
                        into transitory expedients of personal aggrandizement and physical stimuli
                        and the upshot of such a process must be a quarried world of rank weeds and
                        domestic pests on the one hand and, on the other hand, a few useful but
                        diseased, dependent, degenerate plants and animals tamed and cowed.</p>

                    <p>THE ADVANTAGE OF SCIENCE</p>
                    <p>It must be admitted that the modern age has been useful, if it can provide
                        the foundation for a freer life for succeeding generations. The scope for
                        imagination is a hundred-fold greater than at any time in history. A squad
                        of men with mechanical equipment can perform feats of construction in a year
                        worthy of centuries with legions of workers before. If, as has been stated,
                        our average man, woman and child now have at their disposal physical force
                        equal to some twenty slaves then, as compared with former civilizations
                        based on six serf power to one free man, our powers for self expression are
                        in the aggregate six times or 120 times as great for destruction or
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>SHORTCOMINGS OF SCIENCE</p>
                    <p>What a pity that the monument to this power, so far, exists in our cities all
                        alike dirty, monotonous, disorderly and desolate, with their conscious
                        pretensions and reiteration of the commonplace and the lifeless forms of
                        antiquity. I hope and believe we are not satisfied with this as the final
                        product of science. The great scientists themselves have about come to the
                        end of their pursuit of matter, in the elusive electron most intelligibly
                        characterized in a citation by Henri Poincare as the "Hole in the ether."
                        Just as geographical discovery has now been thrown back onto archeology so,
                        I anticipate, will the pioneering spirits that have evolved physical science
                        turn back, perhaps by way of psychological experiments, to the great mental
                        substratum of mankind which underlies the individual conscious intellect.</p>
                    <p>There is certainly sufficient evidence of the unconscious mind to satisfy the
                        most inductive and empirical experimenter and, considering the completeness
                        with which the whole of mankind has been converted by the pioneers of
                        science in three centuries, a wider awakening to the disused powers of the
                        universal mind need not take long.</p>

                    <p>The people of today are uneasy, straining at their limitations, whether or
                        not they realize that those restrictions are self-imposed on their natural
                        activities. Satisfaction dependent on external stimuli, such as movies,
                        jazz, speedways and acrobatics, is bound to be short lived; these betray a
                        craving for emotional satisfaction which can never be attained except
                        through feelings in sympathy with rather than opposed to practical needs and
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>REVERSION TO FULLER LIFE</p>
                    <p>Such satisfaction can be found through social consciousness on the one hand
                        and aesthetic appreciation on the other. The present hectic state can only
                        bring about quick exhaustion but it contains a certain spontaneity and so
                        much less hypocrisy than the intellectual, puritanical pretension of only a
                        few years back that it may betoken the turning point from a purely
                        intellectual outlook and timid repression back to a broader psychological
                        and emotional contact with life. After passive simian curiosity has been
                        satisfied in the pioneers of thought, and after economic strain on the
                        underlying humanity has been eased by the expedients of practical followers
                        of science then, when the physical senses have become calloused to
                        excitement, more and more men will be turning their attention inward to the
                        possibilities of co-operation between the head and the heart in social
                        service and creative effort.</p>
                    <p>The scientific beliefs of our intellectual philosophy, which have failed to
                        develop an organic communal life, have been inconsistent or fundamentally in
                        conflict with an enduring civilization. We have come to recognize an
                        external natural order of things which we see, hear, touch, smell and taste
                        and consider real, but such a world of isolated, individual intellect
                        supplies no place for instinctive ideals or desires such as justice or
                        beauty; and if the supernatural or divine world once conceived by us to
                        support those ideals</p>

                    <p>has lost its reality we must find something else that will. Perhaps the
                        pioneers who have for some years been exploring the complexities and
                        conditions for the full-rounded, healthy working of the human mind or soul
                        may be evolving a practical religion compatible with modern objective
                        science taking into account, without the prop of external agencies,
                        mankind's vast subjective activities, desires and needs.</p>

                    <p>It is hardly possible to boil life down into twenty or two hundred formulae
                        that might pop into one's head, but it is astonishing how the lack of
                        differentiation between, or the omission of, one or the other of these
                        simple factors has left such unsolved equations in fundamental human
                        problems that we have failed to attain a happier objective.</p>

                    <p>NATURAL LIFE BEFORE ARCHITECTURAL GROWTH</p>
                    <p>It is but natural for each of us to rank high in importance the particular
                        field of work on which he happens to be employed. It is also right, and
                        necessary to his self-respect, to make it possible that all the multifarious
                        duties in the world be discharged. In the measure that a man speaks
                        truthfully he conveys his own perspective of the universe with the things in
                        his foreground looming largest.</p>
                    <p>However, as already pointed out, architecture is an inescapable expression
                        and revelation of and to all mankind, and one's relation to it is an index
                        of his individuality. It is therefore really important to the fundamental
                        self-respect of everyone of us to study life from the perspective point of
                        the architect. In the future as sure as fate our purposes, our strength, our
                        insincerities, our foibles will be an open book in the remains or ruins of
                        our buildings. The record is not only qualitative but quantitative as the
                        last resultant of all our physical powers.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present day - to attempt to discuss this subject without
                        illustrations would be a waste of time but we all witness now so many miles
                        of pictures weekly that it is unnecessary to portray the fact - the monotony
                        of the modern environment is not merely here but everywhere. The isolated
                        relics of earlier art as well as the unique variations in races of men and
                        genera of plants and animals are being obliterated in the ubiquitous
                        standardized product of our building art. It is significant that not until
                        the modern intellectual age of renaissance did we hear much of anything
                        about architects, and it is not to the architects that we go to learn
                        architecture now, even in the schools where the cult is taught, but
                        ultimately to the unidentified origin back in the naive, subconscious
                        creative periods when art was not in conflict with the surrounding natural
                        world nor a reflex of internal strife.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>This structure illustrates Griffin's freedom from the domination of the past
                        and his genius for economy.</p>
                    <p>The revolution in <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright's designs with the coming
                        in of Griffin did not end with the <note>Frank W.</note> Thomas house which
                        was lifted up out of the ground. I myself realized later that Wright was
                        quick on the uptake. The <note>Isidore</note> Heller house which was on the
                        boards when I entered like the <note>William H.</note> Winslow house was the
                        old colonial plan. In a bit of free time I designed a house for my family in
                        Hubbard Woods where we children had grown up. It was a long narrow oblong
                        with an octagonal room flanking on either side near the front. The next
                        Wright house was that plan - the <note>Joseph and Helen</note> Husser House
                        - but two squares instead of the octagons. I thought nothing of that till
                        years later Wright began his publications claiming all the young Chicago
                        Architects as his disciples, which was far from the truth. I would grant
                        that what one likes one can use - as on the growth of Gothic - but cannot
                        claim.</p>

                    <p>BACK TO NATURE</p>
                    <p>The definite idea of architecture to my mind lies in the organic, systematic
                        way of creation that nature shows in fitting an infinite variety of means to
                        as many ends with perfection of form for every function - to recall Louis
                        Sullivan's alliteration:- "Form follows Function."</p>
                    <p>Communion with primeval nature is the common school for future architects
                        that it was in the beginning of civilization when everywhere in every race
                        and every climate <hi rend="ul">anonymous</hi> architects expressed fitness
                        and beauty in their constructions.</p>
                    <p>Nowhere in the modern world have the conditions set a more attractive problem
                        for the architect than in the wooded rock ledges of the headlands of Sydney
                        Harbor - a nice problem, for the factors are definitely clear-cut and simple
                        socially, economically and aesthetically:- a million people free to exercise
                        their own judgment, economically able to provide themselves with fully
                        equipped and appointed substantial homes with a beautiful, easily worked
                        stone and underlying their sites and all other building materials
                        indigenous, and all skill and equipment, handy, and the most, beautiful
                        outlook possible to imagine complete to start with.</p>
                    <p>The aesthetic requirements are modesty to the extent of subordination of
                        structural features to the striking characteristics of the forested cliffs,
                        using the stone and level coursing uniform with them that will accomplish
                        this, and a diminutive scale of one story that can accord with the
                        diminutiveness of natural forms without breaking with the established habits
                        and accepted type plans. After a hundred years during which every
                        alternative has been introduced from every corner of the earth this natural
                        formula is now being tried out at Castlecrag in Sydney Harbor.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>The elimination of external walls as walls in dwellings and other buildings
                        and substituting piers and grouped fenestration came about after Griffin
                        entered into partnership with <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright.</p>
                    <p>This dwelling of Mr. <note>William F.</note> Tempel has this formality. In
                        this case the living room is on the ground level and thus becomes a story
                        and a half high and the dining room becomes a balcony of the living room. It
                        is hard to express in words the elegance and openness of such an
                        arrangement. Even a small house can become impressively spacious.</p>
                    <p>Griffin completely solved the problem of a floor built solidly on the ground
                        by embedding 2″ by 1 1/2″ floor joists in an asphalt pavement and laying the
                        floor boards directly on this asphalt.</p>

                    <p>Caption</p>
                    <p>Griffin in his early work - American - was really classic though strictly
                        20th Century, no imitation of the older Classic style, but formal and
                        balanced.</p>
                    <p>When handling the lovely valleys of Castlecrag his works were often romantic,
                        as indeed were the Capitol Theatre and the Cafe Australia of Melbourne.</p>
                    <p>In India he became what a 20th Century man should be - a free individual no
                        longer under the control of the Folk Soul - and his work there covered a
                        wide range of designs, continually creating new styles so to speak - as Mr.
                            <note>Talbot Faulkner</note> Hamlin of the Columbia University said -
                        "uniquely original." </p>

                    <p>CHILDHOOD - Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>The first vivid picture of a personality inflexible, indomitable, is a baby
                        boy following his mother about the garden patting the flowers as he went.
                        All his life it hurt him to have flowers picked, hurt him as it does others
                        to see a bird's wing broken, an absorbing love that enabled him to recognize
                        new flowers in the field that he had read about in encyclopedias years
                        before, the absorbing interest that develops the absolute memory. This
                        memory in later years enabled him, in a new country with a different
                        monetary system and utterly different prices of materials (after one day and
                        night spent with a contractor going over prices of all building materials),
                        to go on the witness stand quite ready to answer any questions with definite
                        statements as to current prices.</p>
                    <p>As a little boy in school, teased and bullied by bigger boys, he decided that
                        if he cried when they hurt him it would amuse them to keep up their torments
                        so he never cried no matter what they did. They soon quit bothering him. In
                        manhood no one could disturb his equanimity. I have seen him go through
                        torments that have driven other men into rages of fury with blood-shot eyes,
                        that have thrown them quite off their balance; but they never got under his
                        skin, they never disturbed the sweetness of his disposition, they were never
                        to wear him out as he could have been worn if he had allowed his emotions to
                        be roused.</p>
                    <p>When eleven years of age he received a pamphlet from the U.S. Government
                        doubtless intended for his father. It was one of Henry George's. He read it
                        and decided on the first book he would draw from the library. A year later,
                        for in those days children couldn't draw books till they were twelve, he
                        drew out George's Social Science. The problems of humanity then became his
                        problems and with the thorough grounding of one of the masters of Economics
                        he looked at life with the clear eyes of one building on firm foundations,
                        distinguishing between man-made and God-made things. Possibly this early
                        contact with</p>
                    <note>Henry George (1839-1897) was an American land reformer and economist who
                        advocated a single tax on the value of land in his 1879 book "Progress and
                        Poverty."</note>

                    <p>a clear conception of the way of attaining great ends with simple means may
                        have been a determining factor in the conscious life of this youth awakening
                        a powerful will which on the whole is not yet a part of the conscious life
                        of human beings. So great may be the influence of the opening of a spiritual
                        door to a youthful mind. So great may be the service of the adult to the
                        juvenile.</p>
                    <p>A tow-headed, blue eyed suburban child whose boyhood life was redeemed
                        somewhat by the fact that the suburb <note>Maywood and Elmhurst,
                        Illinois</note> was not very extensive in those days making possible long
                        walks in the open fields, occasionally to the river banks, though thoroughly
                        conventional and timid parents forbad swimming. A child's instinctive
                        recognition of its rights and of the necessity of independence in certain
                        realms brought a fair number of plunges in the river swimming pools.</p>
                    <p>Interest early turned to building and the first work executed was the lantern
                        on the roof of his father's barn. From the very first as shown in his first
                        real job - Mr. <note>Thomas E.</note> Wilder's barn - his creative capacity
                        satisfied with nothing short of perfection was masterly and had a dominating
                        and revolutionary effect on the work of the office of Frank Lloyd Wright
                        with whom he entered into partnership in the early days of that office, as
                        illustrated by the dwelling of Mr. Little in Oak Park and the Larkin
                        Building in Detroit <note>Buffalo</note>. His fertility in design in
                        architecture as in town planning has not been matched by anything since the
                        days of Louis Sullivan who broke the ice for creative work in modern times.</p>
                    <p>While still in the grades the key scheme for the city plan was worked out.
                        His clear insight probing to fundamentals led him straight to the basic
                        solution of the double problem of communication and occupation the
                        simultaneous consideration of which like all unities has for so many
                        centuries eluded the mind of man. So long do we humans shuffle along on the
                        surface of the earth and fail to enter the spiritual kingdom where problems
                        are solved. Not so our young dreamer of dreams.</p>

                    <p>Today we are being told that we should determine our aim in life and,
                        satisfied that it is what we will to have and bending our whole being to it,
                        nothing in creation can prevent our attaining our end. Evidently holding
                        that simple faith, though in those early days with no conscious analysis of
                        it, at 20 years of age a sturdy young man went to his state University and
                        demanded a course in Town Planning. No University in the world gave such a
                        course. But pioneer days were not a thing of the long past in Illinois and
                        there were still stalwarts, and the spirit of adventure remained in the
                        spirit of the old as well as in the blood of the young. They told him that
                        if he found six others who would take such a course they would create it for
                        him. He found three others and the course of Town Planning was established
                        in the University of Illinois at Champaign to be followed in the next
                        quarter of a century - after the Australian Federal Capital adventure - by
                        the establishment of courses in Town Planning in many Universities in many
                        countries. Unfortunately the field is still largely controlled by land
                        speculators.</p>

                    <p>What a strange combination of circumstances it was over a hundred years ago
                        that brought together that little colony from New England, England, the
                        South, Canada and the West Indies and planted them in Tazewell County,
                        Illinois, in a spot on its great prairies of waving grass far from any
                        river, sea-cost or mountains to charm the eye or to give promise of a great
                        city rising out of that ocean of grass.</p>
                    <p>In the canal boat that carried its precious load of venturesome dreamers were
                        the young doctor, Augustus Perkins, and his bride, Mary, the English
                        scholar, the Kentucky Colonel, the dashing young teacher Colonel James with
                        his wife and beautiful daughter and young son, Quaker Wilson and his wife,
                        Doctor's brother and wife, a German tinner, two sea captains with families,
                        a banker and, in a short time members of father's and mother's families and
                        other interesting people. On that boat was also a young peasant girl quiet
                        and watchful who on the boat's stopping ran to the wharf and was going to
                        get off when the captain told her this was Ashton. "Ashton," she said, "I
                        thought it was Corpus Christi and here it is this damned place."</p>
                    <p>The members of that colony were of the sterling kind, educated,</p>
                    <pb n="91"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 91 ====]</p>
                    <p>refined and of course courageous and with all the elements that make for
                        success. They had their dreams. They divided the land off into lots, parks,
                        and located public buildings all on paper - all a fizzle, but hardly a
                        family that did not make its mark in the history of Illinois. Four or five
                        died millionaires - not made in Tremont though, and in law and statesmanship
                        many became distinguished. Tremont became the county seat so the brilliant
                        men of the county, like our great <note>Abraham</note> Lincoln, Judge
                            <note>David</note>Davis, <note>Stephen A.</note> Douglas and others were
                        often entertained by our good people though they could not claim them as
                        residents. My Mother told me that when the court was in session she often
                        from our house on the hill could hear the men in the court house roar with
                        laughter at the stories they were telling at two or three o'clock in the
                        morning. All know of Lincoln's gift of story telling and my father could
                        almost match him.</p>
                    <p>The ladies were noted for their refinement, intellect and good cooking. Folks
                        from the neighboring cities flocked to our town when an entertainment was
                        given for they gave us credit for knowing how to entertain after the grand
                        manner. Let me describe one of the banquets. Daniel Webster was reported on
                        his way West and that he would stop in Tremont. All went to work. The Town
                        Hall must be decorated. One of the residents was an East Indian sea captain.
                        He had silks and tapestries that he kindly lent and the ladies used them in
                        decorating. All that had cut glass or silver lent it. At one end of the
                        table the Captain's solid silver set that had been presented by grateful
                        passengers for carrying them through a terrible storm safely, and at the
                        other end another set of the same kind - tray, teapot, sugar bowl, etc. The
                        ladies saw to it that the tables were loaded with tempting food and they
                        were dressed in silks and satins that they had brought to the wilderness in
                        their chests.</p>
                    <p>It was a brilliant affair but the most memorable speech was made by old
                        captain Wybray. I must give you a short sketch of him. He ran</p>

                        he became captain. He was unlettered but a born poet. It was a great treat
                        when his family received letters from him to hear them. Often there would be
                        pages in rhyme. At the banquet when he went to welcome Webster with his
                        little wife on his arm - he was a big man - his words were something of this
                        description. "I have been around the world several times, I have bowed
                        before kings and queens on their thrones, but never with the heart thrill
                        that Love felt in shaking the hand of our illustrious Daniel Webster."
                        Webster was one of my Mother's <note>MMG's grandmother's</note> heroes.
                        Father <note>MMG's grandfather</note> hurt her keenly once. When she had
                        been extolling him father said - "but he never paid your father the hundred
                        he owed him." Father had to humbly beg her pardon.</p>
                    <p>One summer father sent her East to visit old friends and relatives and while
                        visiting at Mr. Webster's his niece said wouldn't you like a lock of Uncle
                        Daniel's hair? He was writing at his desk when his niece went back of him
                        and cut quite a generous lock. While that was happening as he probably had
                        heard what she had said he wrote mother a little note sending his regards to
                        grandfather, etc. On coming home mother found so many wanted "just a few
                        hairs" that she would have no lock left so with the note she had it framed
                        and gave it to her eldest grandson, Dwight H. Perkins. (That and one from
                        Lincoln are still treasured by the family. Another from Lincoln was stolen
                        from the walls of grandson Leslie's living room.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln was a frequent visitor at our house and my mother he admired and
                        honored. When he was made president he remembered his friends of old
                        Tremont. Mr. <note>David</note> Davis of Bloomington who was a frequent
                        guest at Tremont he made a judge of the Supreme Bench <note>Court</note>.
                        John Albert Jones, who used to walk five or ten miles before breakfast and
                        drank from ten to fifteen cups of tea at the parties, he made judge of the
                        Court of Claims, my father, Brigade Surgeon in the Civil War.</p>

                    <p>As these pages are written just for my own family I think here is a good
                        place to speak of father. The beautiful picture of Dr. MacLure in Bonny
                        Brier Bush stories has been thought of by some as an impossibility in fact.
                        The author was asked to answer the question. He said - "It has been my good
                        fortune to know your country doctors, not one of them without faults but who
                        each one of them might have sat for my hero."</p>
                    <p>Father from a little boy seemed cut out for a doctor. He was born in
                        Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and Mother in Sanbornton. Grandfather Lovejoy was
                        its richest man, had his 25 wagons plodding the roads to Boston and lived in
                        the finest mansion in Sanbornton. He failed, went to Toronto when father and
                        mother were married and from there joined the colony that went West to
                        Illinois. Grandfather put what was left of his fortune into a beautiful farm
                        on Rock River. Father is happily described by Mrs. <note>Eliza W.</note>
                        Farnham, one of the early woman suffragists and friend of Lucy Stone and
                        Susan B. Anthony, who in her book called "Life in Prairie Land," said he was
                        another Dr. MacLure. I loved my father dearly and never dreamed anyone could
                        speak of him disrespectfully so I was indignant when a mother, after hours
                        of agony, was reported as saying - "Some say mean things of you but no one
                        could equal you when a woman is in travail."</p>
                    <p>He often traveled sixty or seventy miles to see a patient and in those days
                        they had no nurses and often no woman to help and father would be gone for
                        days and days. For many years he was the only doctor so he attended the
                        birth of most of the little ones. In all his thirty and more years he never
                        lost a mother or a child. A physician told him that was a most remarkable
                        record, that he should have kept a record. He never kept any kind of books
                        and when he did send in a bill being obliged to pay his own bills, often he
                        would get one back equaling his for vegetables they had put in the back of
                        his buggy, which he never asked for and took for granted were presents,
                        especially as he had one</p>

                    <p>of the finest gardens in the country.</p>
                    <p>He was the life of every gathering and the amusement of the young folks when
                        he danced as he kept perfect time and danced on his toes. His horse he
                        always petted and would talk to it. If he fell asleep the horse would always
                        stop when it came to the gate of a place where somebody had been sick,
                        father would open his eyes, look and say - "Nobody sick here now Pomp, go
                        along," and the horse would move on. I used to love to drive over the
                        country with him, and sometimes he would say - "Daughter we shall probably
                        take dinner here and they will possibly have a simple meal, just bacon
                        swimming in fat and boiled potatoes, but eat as though you enjoyed it." Our
                        home was very pretty, built on the top of a hill opposite the square where
                        the red brick courthouse stood. It had circular walks, latticed porches,
                        pretty garden - and now not a vestige of its former self left except the
                        great hard maple trees that father planted when he built. The old court
                        house that should have been converted into a Hall or Library was torn down.</p>
                    <p>The little town of Tremont had its churches and schools. Generally one
                        resident minister but the pulpits were often filled by the ministers of
                        different cities. Of course the Episcopal Church had to be visited whenever
                        it had members that wished confirmation. I will speak of two I knew. Bishop
                        Chase the founder of Jubilee College in or near Bloomington used to come and
                        confirm and to christen. (My brother Leslie graduated from there.) He was
                        gifted but an arbitrary old soul. Once I heard mother say that when he read
                        in the service, "I am the Lord of Hosts," you always felt that was what he
                        considered himself. Bishop Whitehouse was a highly educated polished scholar
                        who, I always felt, must have had a touch of the snob in him or his children
                        would not have been such snobs, but they may have inherited from someone
                        further back. One of has sons came one day into old Dr. Davis' office for
                        attention. The doctor was one of our ablest physicians but a very blunt man
                        and some temper. This day his office, as usual during office hours, was</p>

                    <p>lined with patients sitting in chairs against the walls, when young
                        Whitehouse came in and stepped up to his desk and said he wished him to
                        prescribe. "Take a seat," said the doctor pointing to an empty seat at the
                        end of the long line. He went but in a moment wriggled up to the desk,
                        leaned over and said, "I don't believe you know who I am. I am Bishop
                        Whitehouse's son." "Damnit, take two seats then." He slunk back.</p>
                    <p>In writing of Tremont one must not forget the old Col. James if only to give
                        me a chance to express my gratitude. He left Tremont in its early days and
                        settled in Chicago. Successful in business he had a lovely home. Many
                        remember his grandson, Louis James, who quite distinguished himself on the
                        stage. Col. James' handsome daughter Elizabeth married Thompson Flint who
                        came to Chicago and made his millions in grain here. His wife and mother
                        were always closest friends.</p>
                    <p>But the glory of Tremont is a thing of the past. Captain Wybray's lovely home
                        you would not recognize. Of course there are splendid farms about the town,
                        neat and nice but the charm where? A word of the grand old sea captain. His
                        home a large white mansion in the center of noble trees was noted for its
                        hospitality and refinement. His son, Lawrence Wybray married my beautiful
                        Aunt Sophia and they and the family lived there with the Captain and his
                        dear little wife - a home where all the scattered family could congregate.
                        Two of his sons settled in New Orleans, his lovely daughter Georgine married
                        a rising New Englander who came out West a young man and met his fate and
                        made his fortune finally settling South on a large plantation - sugar. Here
                        I wish I could put in words what I owe that loved couple. During the Civil
                        War as my father was sent to Virginia as Brigade Surgeon, I applied and was
                        assigned to one of Chicago's public schools. Every weekend I was made
                        welcome in their lovely home. I remember one Monday morning a fierce storm
                        was raging but I dressed and started out to get a car on State Street.
                        Standing in the middle of the tracks he stood all muffled up directing the
                        street-car men. At that time he was Superintendent of</p>

                    <p>the street-car lines - I heard a voice - "Go back Clara, I'll see that you
                        get to the school." He never considered himself when he could do anything
                        for a friend.</p>
                    <p>A bride of one of Tremont's rich deserters who had heard him talk of
                        Tremont's glories visited the place and when she failed to find anything
                        interesting she said, "Show me that pear tree that bore pears, the finest
                        that ever grew. It was found with one pear and that tasteless. She had her
                        opinion!</p>

                    <p>A few character sketches:- A tinner was a German and of course a skilled
                        workman. He made furniture also and though I'm 84 years old, next to my 200
                        year old mahogany table that crossed the ocean in 1700 something, went
                        through two fires and still has the same hinges and castors and is a thing
                        of rare beauty, a table the tinner made for me is still one of the strongest
                        best made articles I have. Father went in to his shop one morning and he
                            <note>the tinner</note> said to him, "Doctor isn't hell all confuse?" "I
                        suppose it is," said father. "Well then my wife is hell for she is all
                        confuse."</p>
                    <p>One of the colony was a graceful, handsome, witty, entertaining young man who
                        married a lady very plain but who knew most of everything on every subject
                        of anyone I ever know. She would have made a good Secretary of State. Her
                        husband said she deserved no credit for she couldn't forget.</p>
                    <p>There were five of us children. Mary died when an infant, two other girls and
                        two boys. Of course it was very difficult to get help though father as he
                        went all over the country had better chances than most. But he helped
                        mightily when work piled too high. Sunday was our heaviest day. Father came
                        in laughing one morning and told us about a little red headed boy calling to
                        him over the hedge, - "Say Doctor do you like Sundays?" and father to please
                        him said, "No." "Nor I nuther," said the boy, "and I don't see why the Lord
                        took the longest day for Sunday."</p>

                    <p>Many tied their wagons around father's yard, went to church and knew they
                        would be invited to dinner. Father was a fine provider and mother a tip top
                        cook. "I would drive fifteen miles to get a piece of your lemon pie," we
                        heard, and I myself still think they were the best I ever tasted.</p>
                    <p>My father after his long drives and anxious hours of nursing would come into
                        his home and say, "Mary a strong drop of tea please," which Mother would
                        quickly make ready in one of his pretty little tea pots. My brother Leslie
                        had a blooded pup which was the pride of his life. Also it was a winter of
                        bitter cold. I shall never forget the morning I was called by my father to
                        hurry down stairs if I wanted to see my little sister. He declared I didn't
                        touch the stops. Father took Mother in her breakfast and told her what he
                        had just read in Leslie's journal - "This has been the darndest week for
                        accidents I ever heard of. Father broke his teapot, my dog Don froze to
                        death and Mother had a baby!"</p>

                    <p>My sister became a very fine performer on the piano. Added to her lovely
                        self, that attracted the young people but that annoyed father so he wrote in
                        big letters "Short calls make long friends" and hung it on the mantle. First
                        night two young gents came in and at just midnight they jumped and blew out
                        the lights and rushed out. There was much good cheer and good feeling but
                        much work, but no one of us ever heard our mother speak angrily or even
                        impatiently, and we were no models. She hadn't father's sense of humor,
                        still she amused us at times describing some caller. I remember a lank
                        washed out young girl sitting by the stove waiting for father to put up a
                        prescription and mother, who was all politeness asked after her father.
                        "Father is dead, he died of fever." "And your mother?" "Oh she is dead too.
                        Died of him I guess."</p>
                    <p>But I was to tell of the Bloomington dance. They took their finery and wore
                        home suits. When they returned the next day where their log house had been
                        was a pile of ashes. Father had a fine medical library</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 101 ====]</p>
                    <p>and surgical instruments. It was a very serious loss to him, even if he had
                        the means, which he had not, to buy more he could not get them in a new
                        country. All Mother's wedding gifts, her entire wardrobe, nothing, nothing
                        left. The town people thought an old codger who used to tramp about the
                        country was burned as they saw bones of a skeleton, but it was a skeleton
                        father had in his study. Dear old Quaker Wilson took Mother in and treated
                        her so lovingly, and father was always cheerful and knew that, with
                        patience, comforts and a home would come again.</p>
                    <p>They had a fine Lyceum for several of the colony could act well, so with
                        gatherings here and there, sleighing parties, dances and plays they had many
                        memorable times. The little town grew but since the Civil war but few are
                        left that have any legends to tell of the early days. One left and went to
                        New York leaving his family six millions, another had a great sugar
                        plantation in Louisiana on the Byou <note>Bayou</note> Teche, a region made
                        famous by <note>Henry Wadsworth</note> Longfellow.</p>
                    <p>After the house burning Quaker Wilson and his wife took us into their home
                        and their loving care and tenderness could never be forgotten. All the
                        able-bodied men went to work to build a log cabin and the ladies to sewing
                        articles for the doctor's wife Mary. Soon Hamlet, one of father's brothers,
                        came with his bride who though called plain would outshine any young beauty
                        by her grace, intelligence and charm of manner. Aunt Margaret in her
                        happiness saw everything in a rosy light. She wrote to her husband's
                        brother, Judge Hamilton Perkins of Concord, New Hampshire, of her romantic
                        life on the Prairie describing herself as reclining on a couch with crimson
                        covering, and other matters in the same glowing colors which caused Uncle
                        Hamilton to say when he later on received a letter from Mother - "Now we
                        shall get facts as here is a letter from Mary." I dare say he learned the
                        truth about things but it would be cheerful, full of hope but facts. He
                        would be able to picture the couch as boards on boxes and covered with
                        turkey red.</p>
                    <note>"Lyceum" - The Lyceum movement, named after Aristotle's school in Athens,
                        was an early form of adult education which flourished before the American
                        Civil War. The movement came to include not only professional lecturers but
                        also local debates, discussions, and talent productions.</note>

                    <p>Men used to say that neither horse nor water would ever be the cause of
                        Hamilton Perkins' death he was such a superb rider and swimmer. Little they
                        knew. Uncle Hamilton went into the lumber business up by the Falls of St.
                        Anthony. His house was built on a high place overlooking the falls. The
                        winter had been severe and in order to prevent serious trouble the ice had
                        to be broken. None of the men would risk it so Uncle went to work and soon
                        the great piece he was working on moved and as he stood erect with his arms
                        folded across his chest it quickly moved on by his home from the windows of
                        which his wife and three children saw him carried over the falls.</p>
                    <p>Years later our Quaker friends, the Wilsons were murdered in their Winnetka
                        home, and as far as I know the murderer is still living unmolested and
                        undisturbed. Mrs. Sawyer, another Tremont character, believed in feeding
                        people so all her life she rose at two or three o'clock and cooked so she
                        could have pies, cakes, meat and hot bread for breakfast. Her son and a
                        young girl she raised used to scrap in the yard and she would raise the
                        window and exclaim, "Abail Buss and Sara Ann ain't ye ashamed of
                        yourselves!"</p>
                    <p>The Platt family had a large family of girls all very intelligent but of
                        delicate health. The two eldest were addicted to walking in their sleep.
                        Julia would rise, go out, do all her chores and commence getting breakfast
                        when Uncle Nathan who married the eldest sister would hear her and awaken
                        her. The traveling ministers and lecturers often stayed with us while they
                        remained and one night Rev. L. read us a sonnet of <note>John</note>
                        Milton's. Not long after Angeline had gone to her bed her mother called to
                        father and said, "Augustus, Angeline is sitting up in bed and talking a
                        steady stream. Father when he reached her said, "She is talking in her sleep
                        and is repeating verbatim Milton's sonnet that Mr. L. read. She had never
                        read it nor heard it before and could not repeat any of it when awakened.</p>

                    <p>Of course some of the colony had some means with them and soon homes appeared
                        but most started in log cabins. Whenever an adjoining town had a dance or a
                        good time all the neighboring towns would endeavor to send representatives.
                        Bloomington, Pekin and Peoria were busy towns. Bloomington reported it was
                        to have a dance so many of the villagers planned to go and among them father
                        and mother. Mother was called Queen of the West and when she was arrayed in
                        her yellow satin which set off her marble white skin, black hair and stately
                        figure she looked it every inch.</p>

                        Sullivan's office. Griffin had established the 2nd Story horizontal sill
                        line, he and others perhaps under the influence of the Japanese prints of
                        the Columbia Exposition which waked up America to the beauty of the oriental

                    <p>One might say this is a flat roof house in its simplest terms. Its very

                    <p>I had an interesting experience. I stood in a doorway in the bright sun, my
                        shadow sharply cast on my light carpet as was also the jamb of the doorway.
                        Presently my attention was arrested by a surprising thing that happened
                        every time the shadow of my arm came near to the shadow of the door jamb. A
                        big lump almost the size of my fist swelled up on my arm's shadow and
                        reached out till it joined the jamb's shadow. On closer inspection I saw
                        that there was also a smaller lump reaching out from the larger shadow
                        toward that of my arm. I have in only one case found a material scientist
                        who would give any serious attention to this fact or who would offer an
                        explanation of it though all of them are familiar with the fact of osmosis
                        where one liquid is drawn toward another. Too interested in their theory to
                        pay any attention to facts. In astronomical observations of the transit of
                        Venus the scientists have made the same observations but brushed them aside
                        hoping for better luck next time. It was again a case of darkness attracting
                        darkness - darkness the beginning of matter, the creator of liquidity,
                        exhibits the phenomenon of attraction. For a fascinating exposition of this
                        phenomenon I refer you to the 6th lecture of Dr. Rudolf Steiner's series on
                        light.</p>

                    <p>First of all it is necessary to understand that all superficial
                        characteristics should be the natural consequence of underlying structural
                        requirements. Honesty is quite as basic a necessity in architecture as in
                        other fields of life. We find here as everywhere that spiritual qualities
                        precede material expression and real and permanent beauties can result only
                        on such a foundation. Thus, to attain beautiful results in architecture
                        there must be no superficial requirements but purely rational ones and the
                        whole effort of the architect must be bent toward the accomplishment of
                        three things:- An absolute solution of the problem resulting from due
                        consideration of all the elements which have any bearing on it; an honest
                        use of materials in accordance with their nature, and perfection of form.</p>
                    <p>The first of these, a solution of the problem, we have been discussing in the
                        previous lessons. The second point is the honest use of materials.</p>
                    <p>There is no necessity nor is it tolerable that any material used in a
                        structure should be made in imitation of any other material. Sham, wherever
                        found, is intensely disagreeable and savors of those class distinctions we
                        find in undemocratic communities which classify human beings on purely
                        superficial qualifications. All materials in nature are beautiful, and
                        structures will be beautiful if materials are used frankly and treated
                        according to their natural characteristics, and we find, in fact, an
                        infinite variety of perfect structures where it is as impossible to say that
                        one is more beautiful than another as it is to say that one landscape is
                        more beautiful than another, and these structures may be of any material,
                        whether it be the unbaked mud of Adobe structures of some of the Indian
                        peoples or whether they be of bamboo or stone. The ugliness arises only when
                        we try to twist one material into imitation of another as of wood cut or
                        painted to represent bricks or concrete shaped to imitate stone or any of
                        the other innumerable subterfuges so commonly made use of</p>

                    <p>At the end of that year with a drop in the pressure of office work I was
                        dropped and went into the office of F.L. <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright
                        whose 1st and, with one exception, only office building was just under
                        construction.</p>

                    <p>in our own time.</p>
                    <p>The third requirement is perfection of form.</p>
                    <p>We use this term "perfect" in the same way as in speaking of a crystal, that
                        is, the shape should be simple enough to be comprehensible and should be
                        complete. This is as necessary in anything that presents itself to the eye
                        as harmony is to whatever presents itself to the ear if it is to separate
                        itself from chaos and appeal to our consciousness as a creation, a
                        structure, a thing - in architecture, a building.</p>
                    <p>Here, as in all the works of man, to have a thing attractive it must
                        emphasize the fact that it is the work of an intelligent creature who has
                        done his work in joy and affection in the full expression of his capacities.</p>
                    <p>We will discuss and consider the honest use of materials.</p>
                    <p>We find the natural building materials most generally used for the shelter of
                        human beings have been stone and wood, but to those from very early times
                        have been added artificial materials, brick, tile and concrete. These are
                        quite distinct in their characteristics and nothing but disadvantage arises
                        from the attempt to make them imitate stone. These artificial materials
                        contrast sharply in their characteristics, the brick and tile because of the
                        burning necessary in their manufacture must be in small pieces usually much
                        smaller than stone as ordinarily obtained from the quarries. Concrete, on
                        the other hand, has no such restriction and lends itself to massive
                        structure with large unbroken surfaces. When so used it becomes very
                        impressive and quite as beautiful as any other material. In fact, the
                        possibilities in the use of concrete have barely been touched for there is
                        no limitation of the materials with which it can be made so that its surface
                        effects can vary from the greyish tones of the cement itself to any of the
                        colors of the material with which the cement is mixed, which may be anything
                        from sand to sparkling quartz or exquisite</p>

                        so, brick if used in accordance to its nature will give any of an infinite
                        variety of results both in texture and in color.</p>
                    <p>In this country scarcely more than two kinds of brick are known but in Europe
                        we find a great range both in size, shape and color in this material, and
                        the last decade or two in the United States have developed bricks whose
                        surfaces vary from smooth polished to soft rich surfaces obtained by cutting
                        the bricks with wire and of great range of color from lovely greys through
                        soft or glowing buff or yellow tones to various shades of reds and even of
                        purples. These bricks, with their natural variation in color, give surfaces
                        as lovely and rich as velvet or tapestry.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these main structural elements there are others which are by
                        nature surfacing materials and may be used either for protection or for
                        finish - such stone as can be out in thin layers, as marbles, which may be
                        used either for flooring materials or for the surfacing of walls, exterior
                        or interior, or that form a very serviceable material for making tight air
                        spaces and if properly handled giving a very beautiful surface.</p>
                    <p>Wallpaper, our commonly used cheap substitute for tapestries would better be
                        discarded altogether as far richer effects can be obtained at less cost by
                        omitting the third hard smooth coat of plaster and making the 2nd coat of
                        sufficiently coarse material to give an interesting texture to the wall.
                        Without any further treatment, if properly done, this gives very lovely grey
                        tone. On this surface any color scheme desired can be obtained by the use of
                        transparent stains. We can obtain a glowing or velvety tone with a depth and
                        richness not to be attained with any other material except that of woven
                        fabrics.</p>
                    <p>Wood is not a proper structural material since by nature it is bound to
                        change in size and form whatever precautions may be taken in its seasoning.
                        It is, however, a very beautiful material for surface decoration and can
                        therefore be used to advantage in thin</p>

                        veneering, here, the movement can be entirely overcome and by the use of our
                        modern tools, the machines, we can get broad surfaces showing to full
                        advantage the lovely texture, color and graining of an infinite variety of
                        woods.</p>
                    <p>To bring out to perfection, we should not use complicated forms or thick
                        coating materials such as paint. The finish that is given wood should be
                        only such as is required to preserve it and keep it clean. When used for
                        external work, since it is impossible under the circumstances of the weather
                        to keep highly finished surfaces, the most satisfactory method is to use the
                        wood rough as it comes from the saw instead of the paint dressed surfaces so
                        common at present which have to be painted. These rough surfaces can be
                        simply stained by materials which will penetrate enough to act as
                        preservative of the wood yet do not conceal the character of the wood
                        itself. Such stains can be the tones of the wood itself deepened only enough
                        to prevent unpleasant results which might arise from the soiling of very
                        light colored woods. So treated wood members used in the trimming of a house
                        as for window frames and sashes and eaves and barge boards are far richer in
                        their effect than any less frank use of the material can possibly be. In the
                        interior, protected as it is from the weather, wood can be used for certain
                        members where it may be desirable to use an easily worked material or where
                        lightness is necessary as in the trim about windows and doors, for doors
                        themselves and for furniture whether built in or movable, the most charming
                        effect being gained by the use of the same wood and same finish throughout
                        the house or at least throughout a suite of rooms as the living rooms or the
                        bed rooms, and the most beautiful effects will be obtained not by the high
                        hard polishes but by the most transparent stains, just sufficient to
                        emphasize the natural grained wood, rubbed down with just enough wax to keep
                        dirt from penetrating the wood. This method gives a soft surface scarcely
                        distinguishable from the unfinished wood itself.</p>

                    <p>The determination of what materials shall be used in any structure is settled
                        by several facts, all of which will be affected by the location of the
                        building, for the expense of any one of these materials is largely
                        determined by the locality which in one case may mean that wood is more
                        expensive than any other material as is almost the case in Australia at the
                        present time or may mean that stone will be less expensive than brick. Quite
                        aside from the matter of expenditure it is usually desirable that local
                        materials should be used as most harmonious results, especially for the
                        community, will naturally arise from this method and whatever material is
                        used should be considered for both exterior and interior purposes as the
                        simplicity and harmony and quality of a building is largely determined by
                        the use of the same material wherever appropriate both outside and inside.
                        No other one thing will go so far toward giving a feeling of finish and
                        unity to a building as this.</p>
                    <p>Glass is another material used for quite special purposes and its
                        characteristics can well be taken advantage of for the increasing of the
                        charm of our homes.</p>
                    <p>For a long time the staining of glass appeared to be a lost art as the colors
                        obtained by modern processes were raw and garish. We have found, however,
                        that this resulted from what has been termed too great perfection in its
                        manufacture, since the richness can now be obtained by the introduction of
                        what were considered impurities.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to describe the lovely effects which can be obtained by a proper
                        use or colored glass since so far as I know there is none to be seen in some
                        countries and the matter of scale in all the elements of a building is of
                        vital importance and the subdivision of the glass in windows and doors often
                        goes a long way towards giving a home that feeling of domesticity which is
                        necessary if it is to meet its requirements. These points will affect and
                        hold all the occupants, especially the children whose whole attitude towards
                        life is bound</p>

                    <p>to be deeply affected by the home atmosphere. Here again, if we study the
                        natural character of the material we find we need not go to any great
                        expense to get charming effects for glass, though difficult to cut in curved
                        forms, is easily broken in straight lines. We should not, therefore, make
                        attempts to paint pictures with colored glass but should use geometric
                        motives or purely decorative forms.</p>
                    <p>We come finally to the extreme surfacing material which is color itself
                        which, if it is to be used in such a way as not to obscure the qualities of
                        the surfaces on which it is used, should be applied not in the form of thick
                        paints but in pure transparent stains. These may be water mixtures or oil
                        mixtures, but should not be mixed with the dense materials such as whiting
                        which is almost universally used by our present decorators.</p>
                    <p>As to color itself, not even this should be looked upon as a matter of
                        personal taste and whim. The proper colors to use in interior decoration is
                        quite as such a matter of mathematics as is sound and form. In decorating
                        the interiors of our homes we should recognize that both eye and mind and
                        spirit have definite requirements which will be met only if we conform to
                        the natural laws of color. Human beings are not creatures made to burrow in
                        the dark but light is necessary, both for health and happiness, and this
                        should guide our use of colors in the interior in order that our homes may
                        approximate outdoors in the meeting of these requirements as closely as
                        possible. In other words we want to bring light into our homes.</p>
                    <p>A glance at the spectrum will show us that the most luminous part of it is
                        not to be found on either end but in the center. Out of darkness we come
                        gradually into intense light and on again into darkness. The blue, violet
                        and indigo rays tend toward obscurity as well as the deep red end of the
                        spectrum and although with direct light such as we get from the sun itself
                        there is still a certain luminosity in these terminal colors of the spectrum
                        yet we will find that from reflected surfaces we can get a feeling of
                        luminosity only by the use of the</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 120 ====]</p>
                    <p>central colors, therefore, the violets and indigos and reds are debarred from
                        use in interiors and we find that wherever they are used there has been an
                        attempt to overcome this fact by using them mixed with white which results
                        in pasty, sickly tints which should never be used at all in decoration.
                        Neither is it possible to get that feeling of luminosity by one color only.
                        Experiments in decoration of high ceilings have been made which show that an
                        effect of brilliant white can be obtained by painting a ceiling in narrow
                        strips of a succession of colors constantly repeated, and we know that in
                        light itself a union of all the colors of the spectrum result in white. Our
                        rooms should therefore be arranged to make the use of 2 or more colors in a
                        room. In fact, a color scheme can hardly be called a scheme unless it
                        contains 3 tones just as 3 tones are required to form a chord in music. To
                        show the difficulty in the use of words in describing colors I need only say
                        that it sounds as if we were very limited in our choice of colors when we
                        can use only the yellow or its mergings into the red through the orange on
                        the one side and into the greens which are its combination with the blue on
                        the other side but, in fact, the tones so composed are infinite in their
                        variety though they can generally be classified under the one term, russet.
                        It sounds very crude and ugly if we say a room is to be decorated in red,
                        yellow and green; but a mere change of names to russet, gold and olive is
                        sufficient to make one realize that such a combination may be very
                        beautiful.</p>

                    <p>A harem of beauties I boast.<lb/> Most excellent, dutiful wives;<lb/> Each
                        fancies she pleases me most,<lb/> Nor disputes with her sisters, nor
                        strives.<lb/> They are learned and witty and wise;<lb/> On my good and my
                        pleasure they dote:<lb/> But they never break family ties<lb/> To wrangle in
                        public nor vote.</p>
                    <p>At a word their soft breasts they unfold<lb/> And yield to my spirit's
                        embrace;<lb/> Yet when o'er her charms I grow cold.<lb/> Contented each
                        sinks in her place.<lb/> They fire me, they melt me, they find<lb/> Where
                        the fountains of feeling are hid,<lb/> And the shackles of passion
                        unbind;<lb/> Yet they hush at the drop of my lid.</p>
                    <p>They tell me the wonderful tales<lb/> Of Persia and Araby blest;<lb/> One
                        speaks of Europe's fair vales,<lb/> And one of the virginal West.<lb/> Hot
                        love talk one brings from the South,<lb/> Drunk with the sun's ardent
                        beams;<lb/> And folk-lore one has in her mouth,<lb/> From the Northland's
                        magnificent dreams.</p>
                    <p>Every week a new, beautiful form<lb/> On my harem's retreat I enfold.<lb/> To
                        the new love I'm never less warm -<lb/> Toward the old love I never grow
                        cold;<lb/> Yet censure I scorn and defy,<lb/> And in virtue's calm eyes dare
                        to look;<lb/> No Morman <note>Mormon</note> nor Turkman am I -<lb/> Each
                        beauty I boast is a book.</p>

                        spook,<lb/> I'll dwell on the Stygian coast<lb/> And solace my soul with a

                    <p>DWELLING. D.M. AMBERG . GRAND RAPIDS . MICHIGAN<lb/> MARION M. GRIFFIN
                        &amp; HERMAN von HOLST . ARCHITECTS</p>
                    <p>In designing this house advantage was taken of the natural topography. A good
                        many residences in that part of Grand Rapids are located on top of a high
                        embankment which rises up from a number of the streets. The Amberg house
                        being located on the corner lot and with such an embankment gave the
                        opportunity to build practically a one story house as viewed from the street
                        leaving the driveway to go under the house on the street level. The total
                        height from the sidewalk level to the highest floor is one story. By varying
                        the height of the floors between the living room and the rest of the house
                        we get added height in the large living room which makes it possible to get
                        a very attractive scheme of ceiling lighting.</p>
                    <p>The main entrance from both sidewalk and driveway comes directly under the
                        dining room. Two-thirds of a flight of stairs brings one to the level of the
                        living room, morning room, living porch and hallway, giving access to the
                        small outdoor flight of steps to the garden located in the inner angle of
                        the lot, making it unnecessary to cross the driveway in order to reach this
                        sunken garden. Five steps above the living room level are the dining room,
                        service pantry and kitchen. This leaves the space below the service quarters
                        entirely out of the ground so that the servants' bedrooms could be provided
                        with full windows which would take away any feeling of being in basement
                        rooms. It also leaves the servants' quarters in an "L" by themselves with
                        direct entrance from the driveway.</p>
                    <p>By raising the floor of the bedrooms to the same height as that of the dining
                        room the feeling of seclusion to the sleeping quarters is obtained and the
                        window sills are lifted so high above the level of the lot at the top of the
                        terrace that no one can look directly into the rooms even from that level.</p>
                    <p>The placing of the main bedroom at the end of the lot gives it the beautiful
                        outlook to the south over the sunken garden. By carrying the</p>

                        harmonizes with the general tones. The roof is of tile and copper with a
                        brown quarry tile. The interior woodwork is all plain sawed oak with a light
                        brown stain harmonizing with the tone of the brick which has been carried
                        into the inside of the house in the living room and the morning room

                    <p>MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM. - Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>Her father was an Irish poet, journalist and educator; her mother the most
                        democratic of human beings, a mother who never dreamed of dictating to her
                        children and a rambunctious five they were. I quote from a New Year's
                        greeting she sent to her friends:- "A word to that faithful company of
                        co-workers who made my life one continual delight. (her teachers) Their high
                        ideals, their unvarying steadfastness to duty, caused one of our head
                        supervisors to say, 'this institution could be left without a head for a
                        year and yet maintain its standard.' I always knew I was simply a good
                        organizer and an appreciative onlooker of the superb good work you did. And
                        reference should be made here to our able and efficient engineer who told
                        one of the force that he had 'been with us seventeen years and had never had
                        a disagreeable word spoken to him.' Ever ready to do and to watch after all
                        the physical comforts, we were able to maintain an "even temper" as long as
                        the air was fresh and the temperature even. Good-bye to the Christmas
                        Holidays and a ring into the New Year."</p>
                    <p>Marion, the second born child, was a fragile thing that Mother had to keep
                        out doors, ill as soon as she was brought into the house. Father was from
                        Cork. Mother was of New England blood dating back almost to its beginnings.
                        Father emigrated from Ireland when a boy. He was a Catholic, Mother a
                        Unitarian - the only two logical positions as father said. On the death of
                        her <note>"his" crossed out</note> father our father took the gold from his
                        pocket and had it made into a napkin ring for Jerome and a finger ring for
                        me, the only grandchildren yet born.</p>
                    <p>A kindly fate in the form of the Chicago fire drove them out, with the two
                        babes in a clothes basket, to dwell for a decade (when fire burned their
                        house to the ground and sent them back to Chicago) in the loveliest spot you
                        can imagine, beyond suburbia - four houses and no others within a mile in
                        any direction. Our home was at the head of a lovely ravine. A half mile walk
                        through the beautiful forest to the</p>

                        wide sandy beach, to the west, half a mile through scrub to the marvelous
                        Skokie, head waters of the Chicago River, stretching for endless miles.</p>
                    <p>Such a wonderful place for children to develop, God's university. All the
                        wonders of the wilderness and yet so convenient to the city that both father
                        and mother slipped into the city for their daily work. Town planning would
                        make such things possible for all children, just a little foresight. We
                        children were safeguarded by a grand Irish housekeeper, and educated by that
                        greatest of teachers - Mother Nature - and in her loveliest mood.</p>
                    <p>And in the lap of nature she grew well and wiry. When city guests came out
                        for the week end she was called upon to exhibit her tree-climbing feats.
                        Gathered on the veranda they watched her, barefooted, climb monkey fashion
                        the tree just in front of the house, branchless well above the top of the
                        two story house. And they teased the boys because they couldn't do it.</p>
                    <p>When school age came they thought nothing of the mile walk to the village
                        school at Winnetka. Always that was supplemented by the outdoor life. In the
                        early spring gathering hepaticas from under the very snow, on to fall with
                        its wild hickory huts, black walnuts and butternuts and hazelnuts; and the
                        berries - raspberries, black berries, blue berries June berries and wild
                        grapes and crab apples and on in the winter snow, wintergreen berries. And
                        then always the marvel of the lake! the joys and delights in the summer, the
                        ice hills and caverns piled up in the winter and, when a storm was on, the
                        walks through the woods with father and mother to the top of the bluff to
                        watch the grandeur of the waves piling up over the sands and battering and
                        foaming up the bluff itself. Did ever children have such joys.</p>

                        the family moved into the city. The grandfather's rings were about the only
                        things saved from the blaze. In the city Marion carried on with her
                        tomboyish ways; in the winter hitching her sled onto the passing wagons,
                        etc., though so shy of human beings even when well along in her teens that
                        she would walk around the block to avoid greeting an acquaintance seen
                        approaching in the distance. Then Aunt Myra - her great pal during all the
                        years of this saint's life — took her home to Tremont for a year with the
                        maternal grand-parents, the stately grandmother carrying on the household
                        duties, the grandfather, who had never lost a baby, lying on his deathbed
                        though the nine year old child was entirely unconscious of this fact.</p>

                        and to the neighboring towns giving piano lessons, the wee girl went to
                        school and managed so to ingratiate herself to her teacher that they became
                        lifelong correspondents in spite of the fact that she told a lie to her when
                        asked if she was chewing gum. Miss Fenner instead of reproving her
                        reprimanded the other pupils for leading this little girl to this act. I
                        never forgot it (though I can't to this day see how she managed to make out
                        a case against them) but in later years appreciated her pedagogical talent.
                        I had the habit that year of telling lies - when Aunt Myra asked me if I had
                        brushed my teeth or Grandma asked if I had been sliding in the ice - wearing
                        out my shoes and so forbidden.</p>
                    <p>Many years after when I spoke to Aunt Myra about it as contrasted with my
                        truthful disposition, she said, "Yes why did you do it?" My present
                        philosophical analysis is that I was quite consciously rebellious of this to
                        my mind quite unwarranted assumption of authority on their part, especially
                        in things that Mother would never have dreamed of opposing - but mostly just
                        a general stand against authority.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 134 ====]</p>
                    <p>These instances stand out so vividly that, together with my estimation of my
                        own character, I am inclined to consider them very important from a
                        pedagogical point of view. I've helped many a mother to realize that it is
                        folly to expect morals in young children and bad pedagogy to emphasize them.</p>
                    <p>With grandfather gone I was no longer of importance in grandmother's home, to
                        run errands in emergencies since Aunty's work took her far afield (though I
                        was never conscious of my usefulness while I was there. I think now it would
                        have been wholesome for me to have known. Children appreciate and respond to
                        a consciousness of responsibility.) So I returned home again where the only
                        outdoor playground was the streets except for a pocket handkerchief back
                        yard where many circus tricks were performed. But one day as I was
                        approaching my twelfth year Mother called me up onto the little entrance
                        porch and suggested that I was getting to be too big a girl to romp in the
                        streets. My soul was filled with astonishment and rage. I think I gave her
                        no more worry on that score but I still played hop scotch even after I
                        became a teacher much to the amazement and delight of the school children.</p>
                    <p>Then my Father's death - Angina Pectoris - the youngest of the five children,
                        Leslie, only four years old - and the whole burden, though I fancy it never
                        occurred to mother in the light of a burden - but the whole responsibility
                        in every field on her alone, economic, domestic, educational, social - and
                        how full she filled them all and her loneliness without her beloved only on
                        the rarest of occasions becoming visible to the rest of us. Once she said to
                        me - "When I am crossing a street in the midst of traffic I think - 'Jere
                            <note>Jeremiah</note> is beside me and will look out for me.'" And it
                        was a lucky thing he did for she was a holy terror in the midst of high
                        speed traffic. In her seventies she would cross the main thoroughfares with
                        dignity at a quiet pace utterly oblivious while drivers and motorists cursed
                        and swore but did not touch her.</p>

                    <p>Father was adored by all who knew him. In Hubbard Woods the neighbor across
                        the street, James Chisholm, a journalist, his wife a singer, worshiped the
                        ground he walked on. These two were as likely to drop in on each other at
                        2AM as any other time of day - their wives quite uncomplaining. In the wee
                        hours it never occurred to father to abstain from waking mother, as he was
                        turning in, to read her his latest poem or dilate on a bright idea.</p>
                    <p>For some time he was principal of one of Chicago's schools. His teachers
                        adored him. One night not long after his death Mrs. <note>Ella Flagg
                        Young?</note> came in with a box which she handed to Mother. Mother said,
                        "It feels as if it were filled with gold," - took it to the beautiful old
                        mahogany table - such a vivid picture in my mind - opened it and in truth it
                        was filled with gold - a shining thousand dollars to give all the thrills of
                        a miser to one who was furthest possible from being one, collected by the
                        teachers who knew and loved them both, as an expression of their affection.</p>
                    <p>Father was one who acted on conviction of the human individual's power. When
                        the time came for the selection of a school superintendent he determined
                        that his old school teacher, Mr. Howland, should be the one chosen. He threw
                        articles into all the news papers till - "such was the pressure of public
                        opinion" - Mr. Howland was selected for the position. He and Mrs. <note>Ella
                            Flagg</note> Young were the only great and worthy ones who have held
                        that position in Chicago. Mrs. Young, interestingly enough, when thrown out
                        of her position by a political mayor catering to job seekers who resented a
                        woman's holding so remunerative a position, was reinstated through the
                        uproar of "public opinion," this time the women of Chicago who in the midst
                        of the turmoil had received the franchise. The women succeeded in this
                        though all the men were saying - "If she's out she's out. It isn't possible
                        to get her back. What you women should do is to decide on someone else who
                        will suit you and concentrate on <hi rend="ul">him</hi>." But the women had
                        determined to put Mrs. Young back and they did.</p>
                    <pb n="137"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 137 ====]</p>
                    <p>Public opinion in truth! Then politicians cut their Gordian knot by creating
                        another office, giving it equal pay with the superintendency and putting a
                        man in it. With the franchise in their hands the women could throw out the
                        Mayor and he knew it.</p>
                    <p>Father had the reputation of being the best slinger of the King's English in
                        the city. And friends have told me of how he would sit quietly of an evening
                        and then suddenly take the floor and the whole group would be aflame. Oh!
                        these Irish! One of his poems - My Harem - written to his books was
                        published shortly before and was almost identical with a poem by Oliver
                        Wendell Holmes. Father wrote him about it saying if the dates had been
                        reversed he, the unknown of the two, would certainly have been suspected of
                        plagiarism. He received a very pleasant reply commenting on the frequency of
                        such occurrencies and that it wasn't the first time it had happened to him,
                        Mr. Holmes. You see things do come out of the blue if one has access to it.
                        No rational thinker can accept the idea of chance. A creative idea when once
                        conceived is imprinted on the others and is accessible to imaginative,
                        though not to rational, thinkers.</p>
                    <p>During those early days in Chicago Mrs. Young was the principle of the school
                        all the children attended. On her return from the country school Marion was
                        placed by her in a 5th grade room with instructions to Miss Jones to pass
                        her on to 6th grade if possible. The year would end in a month. The class
                        was reviewing and Miss Jones pushed her through. On Father's death the only
                        just 4 year old Leslie was put in first grade (there were no kindergartens
                        in those days) and made his grades regularly. When the five <note>Jerome,
                            Marion, Gerald, Georgine, Leslie</note> were through the teachers said -
                        "Thank God that's the last of the Mahonys." Mrs. Young expected them to make
                        all Jere's <note>Jeremiah's</note> children shine. She also, the year after
                        Mother was thrown on her own, coached her for the principal's exam which she
                        passed, to which position Mother was eminently fitted and in which she
                        became one of the leaders in all the progressive movements of the Chicago</p>

                        idolized sister, came to live with us and from that time formed an integral

                        <hi rend="ul">THINKING</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the greatest schools for thinking is one's friendships. The fact that
                        Aunt Myra lived with us during the years after Father's death meant that we
                        all had a second Mother and a wonderful bosom friend. A pianist and teacher,
                        she too was a natural educator and took lessons of all the great pianists
                        who came to Chicago in those days. So she was among those who developed a
                        system of pedagogy in music which rapidly brought the music of the United
                        States up to a high standard. This gave me an opportunity to see, through my
                        own experience, how important it is for us now to take the schools out of
                        the hands of the political organization - as important as it was a while
                        back to take it out of the control of the church. For when I had completed
                        my school work including the university and was ready to start practicing
                        the arts as a profession I found I knew nothing, could do nothing. It was
                        the custom in those days to teach drawing in the schools but not music so,
                        since one could get the drawing for nothing, the parents accepted it as
                        sufficient whereas with music when a child was not getting satisfactory
                        instruction they would dismiss the teacher and put him in other hands. The
                        drawing therefore like everything else in public schools dropped into a
                        deadly routine of no educational value.</p>
                    <p>When I discovered the consequences in myself I went back, as opportunity
                        offered, to various schools in Boston and Chicago and demanded the kind of
                        work I required, interesting the teachers and creating quite a sensation
                        among the students. Madame and Monsieur Pape were the teachers in Boston and
                        when at the end of a quarter I had to leave for home and expressed my
                        gratitude to them for all they had done for me, Mme. <note>Madame</note>
                        wept and said I was the only student who had ever expressed any thanks
                        though they took so much pains for them. "But," she said, "you certainly got
                        a lot out of your quarter," and I certainly was grateful to them for it. But
                        I had to get what I needed. I found afterwards that there was a privately
                        run school in Chicago in the hands of an old High</p>
                    <pb n="146"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 146 ====]</p>
                    <p>School classmate of mine, Miss Church, and was thrilled to see what
                        interesting work she was doing and what fine creative results she was
                        getting from her pupils. So from my own experience I was able to check what
                        I got from other sources later - that one of the most urgent necessities for
                        establishing a true democracy was the complete separation of the educational
                        system from the political. Only through such a step shall we be enabled to
                        allow creative ability to develop in our young people. As was to be expected
                        Miss Church's enterprise did not last long for at present a private school
                        is a business, and will be until we have established an Abilities
                        Organization to take over, and stands a small chance of being able to
                        continue to exist in competition with government run business. It was run
                        out of existence quite as definitely, though not so self-consciously, as the
                        privately and efficiently run buses were run off the streets in Australia,
                        by increasing and increasing and increasing the taxation on them. We have a
                        chance occasionally to see such instances but how many such undertakings are
                        killed, thwarted, or prevented from ever starting, we have no way of
                        measuring.</p>
                    <p>I have good reason to be thankful to Aunt Myra for her continued interest in
                        my musical education in spite of the fact that I had no special talent in
                        that direction. For through her I became acquainted with music and even
                        achieved a foundation which, after an interim of many years of no practice,
                        enabled me (when the need came for me to forget myself) to practice
                        Beethoven and other composers with sufficient satisfaction to myself to be a
                        great and lasting healing of the soul. We learn that just as the life body
                        (which we have in common with the plants) is a light organization, so is the
                        soul body, builder of the nerve system, a sound organization, thus great
                        creative powers lie in the pulling into shape of the astral body.</p>
                    <p>This enabled me to appreciate the importance of opening the doors of these
                        realms of creative experience to all young people. I lost that close
                        companionship with my Aunt through her death before my</p>

                    <p>marriage, but never have I lost the feeling of the continued closeness of the
                        relationship. In later years I learned through my own experiences, which are
                        the only basis of knowledge, that this non-material realm is a real world as
                        varied and rich as the material world. Reason tells us it must be as it is
                        the causal world, and the smashed atom has informed us that it is the force
                        world. Later I learned this through perceptions which could be checked by
                        the perceptions of others with the same exactitude as the observations of
                        facts in the material realm. But before we had learned to make a conscious
                        entrance into this causal realm it had been amply proved to us that the sort
                        of things which happened to us at critical moments in our eventful lives
                        could not be accounted for by chance. Anyway the belief in chance is
                        contrary to reason and no truly scientific thinker can accept such an
                        absurdity. So, even before we could be conscious of the methods of this
                        world beyond the boundaries of our nineteenth century type of consciousness,
                        we realized that help was being given to us by beings who were concerning
                        themselves with what we were doing and we interpreted it as coming from
                        loved ones who had crossed over into the realm of consciousness of which we
                        had not yet become directly aware. And it is not mediumship nor spiritualism
                        as generally conceived that we are speaking of.</p>
                    <p>As the baby period passed, Mother took her roistering family back to Hubbard
                        Woods for each summer long vacation. There was a bit of an adventurer, Mr.
                        Merriles, who had started building houses West of the tracks and then, I
                        suppose in the pinch of some depression (such an absurdity these
                        depressions) had left them in all their various stages of completion. For
                        years we just chose the best one of them still left and camped therein for
                        the two months. They were gradually disposed of the best one each year being
                        occupied the next year, so we passed down the line, but always so long as
                        there was a roof, a floor and a few walls, it suited us perfectly. We
                        bothered with no furniture.</p>
                    <pb n="149"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====]</p>
                    <p>Mattresses on the floor were luxury enough and when extra guests arrived a
                        blanket on the floor was perfectly satisfactory to the family. There must
                        have been some sort of cooking arrangement though I have no recollection of
                        it, so little was cooking a part of our life, except that when we went out
                        early in the morning for the day's adventure Mother always had one cooked
                        dish.</p>
                    <p>No one ever had more wonderful holidays than we. As we started on the trail,
                        sometimes we would be joined by neighbors or sometimes by city folk who came
                        out for a lark. Always there was the hope that we would live there again and
                        I wept when the allotment next to ours with a sweet bit of the head of a
                        ravine was sold to be built on. And Mrs. West, one of the original four
                        families, watched with her heart in her throat the cutting down of trees,
                        only a few at first, but she told me that others were dying and she was sure
                        it was in consequence of the loss of their companions. She sensed the
                        interrelationship of plant life whose United Ego dwells in the center of the
                        Earth, this living Earth. Bio-dynamic agriculture is proving that natural
                        plant groups are interdependent entities. This despoliation was slow then
                        but rapid afterwards. Here again is one of the instances where if the United
                        States had been a true democracy, with the Abilities Organ established, this
                        whole wonderful ravine district extending from Winnetka miles north through
                        Lake Forest would today, for all its intense occupation, be as beautiful as
                        then giving the citizenry itself every advantage (more than they have under
                        this system of despoliation) and retaining accessibility for all to its
                        loveliness. This is being proved at Castlecrag for here in Hubbard Woods too
                        the lower levels of the valleys themselves and the whole foreshores of the
                        lake could have been retained in a park system in all its pristine grace and
                        majesty. There can be such open beautiful spaces even in the most intensely
                        occupied suburban districts as was proved by Mr. Griffin in the competition
                        inaugurated by the City Club in Chicago shortly before his departure for
                        Australia, in the Newton Center quarter section</p>

                    <p>subdivision.</p>
                    <p>During the first year in High School a lifelong friendship began. Among some
                        40 pupils in the room one young country girl made herself decidedly
                        conspicuous by her free and easy and chatty way with the teacher. I sat
                        quite across the room from her but had spoken to her once whereupon a pal of
                        the moment with scorn in her voice practically instructed me to have nothing
                        to do with that girl. My answer was to pick up my book and march over to sit
                        down with Anna to ask her some question in grammar for she had shown herself
                        to be clever in her studies. She was a natural gypsy - pretty and sparkling
                        - whereas I, although I cared nothing for conventions, was in those days
                        quiet and reserved. But the bonds between us are as close today as they were
                        in our girlhood. My childhood had been in the country too so my thinking was
                        not so cramped as that of the city child.</p>
                    <p>Another lifelong friend from those high school days, in contrast to the
                        sparkling gypsy, was Katherine, a dainty strawberry blond. A considerable
                        part of my spare time after my return from Tech <note>Boston Tech, later
                            renamed MIT</note> was spent in the study of French in that charming and
                        very active French group in her home whose activities consummated in the
                        establishment of the French Theatre in Chicago. This pursuit of French was
                        my initiation in acting for where one is remote from the possibility of
                        hearing a language this participating in drama is an especially good way to
                        learn. Also a different language if really used is a fine training of the
                        thinking powers and this being a thinking language was a most helpful
                        supplement to my native will language, the English, where the verb comes
                        early in the sentence. It was many years before I added German, a feeling
                        language, to my quota whereas every child should have such a trinity in
                        command by the time he is 12 <note>"nine" erased</note> years old for during
                        those early years when the power for acquiring vocabulary is so amazing, a
                        child can learn three languages as easily as one. His health will not be
                        diminished but improved by this through the balancing of</p>

                    <p>That I never became an accomplished linguist in French was evidenced by the

                        journey together and Mlle. Favard continually expressed astonishment and

                        interesting!" Apparently her conversations with me in French had never given
                        her the slightest hint of any such personal qualities.</p>

                        and Mrs. Wilmarth was taking the blame on herself when at last grasping the
                        situation I told her I had passed. It was this young friend, Anna Wilmarth,
                        who put me through the University. The only return I was ever able to make
                        was earnestness in my work. This Anna Wilmarth was Mrs. Ickes who for many
                        years was a Congressman in the Illinois Legislature and who resigned her
                        position later to go to Washington with Mr. <note>Harold J.</note> Ickes
                        when he became a member of Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet - Minister
                            <note>Secretary of</note> for the Interior. For years she had spent her
                        holidays in the desert of New Mexico, studying and writing of the Indian
                        customs. She didn't do her work from the outside but became an intimate
                        friend of the Indians and was admitted to very secret ceremonies. She
                        learned to know the reality of their different way of thinking and never
                        spoke of them in the light manner so customary with the rational thinkers.
                        Her book should be a help toward making Americans willing to listen without
                        prejudice to those who can show us how, in full consciousness, to add to our
                        rational thinking this other method of thinking which the primitive peoples
                        use intuitively. When we have done that our community can begin to function
                        creatively in free will as nature beings, no longer children who quite
                        properly have to be guided during their immaturity.</p>

                        wife of Harold L. Ickes, an activist and New Deal political figure. She
                        wrote "Mesa Land: The History and Romance of the American Southwest" (1933)

                    <p>Club. I was the only girl in the club so when we gave a public performance I
                        was cast as the countess in one of the two plays. Although at graduation I
                        was voted as the handsomest man in my class, I was completely outrivaled in
                        personal beauty by the countess in the other play, a blond youth who became
                        startlingly beautiful in his feminine array. I had objected when our
                        costumer, the teacher in painting, had instructed me to wear corsets. I said
                        I never did wear them. He said if all the rest of the men could wear corsets
                        I could too. I accepted his logic but laced only moderately whereas the
                        ballet dancers pulled their corsets so tight they could scarcely swallow a
                        mouthful of water on the night of the performance. I assumed a man's name on
                        the program so went before the audience as a man among men. Through this
                        innocent deception I won a great reputation for "Gerald Morse" as an actor.
                        My play was put on first. My maid, the only other woman in the cast, was
                        taken by a man and I learned afterwards of the many compliments:- the
                        wonderful way in which I did a woman's role, how I put on my gloves just
                        like a woman, and so on. But it worked a hardship on my blond rival because
                        when he spoke his first words the audience roared with laughter, his
                        masculinity being completely revealed in his voice.</p>
                    <p>Of my outstanding early friendships, one was Echo Simmons living with the
                        Davises in Hubbard Woods, and a constant companion during the last years of
                        those holidays which ended only with the finish of high school work and my
                        start in the university in Boston in the course of architecture. Echo had
                        come down from Minneapolis <note>Minnesota</note> in a calico gown. There
                        would be no shock in such a procedure today but in those days, as with so
                        many things, it simply wasn't done. Early in our acquaintance Echo walked in
                        the 20 miles to our home in Chicago and as she entered, as cheerily as if
                        she had dropped in from around the block, she called our - "Are there any
                        errands I can do for you Mrs. Mahony?" Her affections were as vital as her
                        body.</p>

                    <p>As I look back now I realize that all along the line the friends were sent to
                        me by my guiding angel to break down the barriers of an individuality that
                        had a natural preference for isolation. This step is the requisite after we
                        have attained individualization in order that our Ego may reverse from
                        concentration within our skin to an expansion in spirit till it includes
                        humanity.</p>
                    <p>Echo would sit on a stile waiting for hours till I came along on the family
                        jaunt for the day to the woods or the lakeshore. There was, through my life,
                        a succession of these lovers, my husband being probably the outstanding
                        exception for apparently it was my task to do this service for him which my
                        friends were doing for me. During our teens Echo and I read and discussed
                            <note>Herbert</note> Spencer and <note>Charles</note> Darwin and such
                        like, absorbing the scientific fundaments of our time as is essential for
                        any people in any time. Thus later one will have established a foundation
                        from which to leap to the science of the future if fear doesn't prevent his
                        taking it. The great service rendered by these nineteenth century thinkers
                        was to establish in the minds of Western peoples the reality of evolution.
                        That their interpretation of facts was topsy-turvy was a detail that could
                        be put to rights by the thinking that was appropriate to the 20th century.
                        Anyone who wishes to understand what is meant by such a statement should
                        read "Man and Animal" by Dr. <note>Hermann</note> Poppelbaum to glimpse the
                        reversal of <note>Ernst</note> Haeckel's tree of evolution, and Dr.
                            <note>Guenther</note> Wachsmuth's "Four Ethers" <note>"Etheric Formative

                        correction and supplementing of the physical sciences.</p>
                    <p>A week or two after my arrival at Boston Tech a niece of <hi rend="ul"
                        >the</hi> Lucy Stone Blackwell <note>women's rights pioneer</note> said to
                        me - the only Westerner among these Boston girls - "I don't see that you are
                        so different from other folk." I laughed and asked her if she had expected
                        to see me with a feather in my hair. She laughed back and said that probably
                        was about what she had expected. The girls were of markedly different types
                        and connections and views but a group of us when graduating started a Round</p>

                    <p>Robin letter which has been going around the world for some forty five years
                        now (for we scattered even to the far antipodes) and is still going strong.
                        It has maintained a close and intimate friendship supplemented only
                        occasionally by transient meetings and itself has always been an extremely
                        interesting document of the lives of these typical American doers. Far apart
                        from each other in their spheres and interests and points of view yet with
                        the closest ties of affection, this one little unit can well make clear the
                        absurdity of the hope so frequently expressed in these days that the
                        solution of our social problems will come about through human beings
                        becoming more alike. They are due to become more and more unlike as
                        individuals though the differences of races ceased with the coming of the
                        Christ who was "the light" and gave that light to every man who comes into
                        the world. Since then there has been no difference between races except
                        physical differences which are disappearing.</p>
                    <p>In the University another friend of the same name as mine, Marion, a most
                        beautiful girl of the <note>Edward</note> Burne-Jones type tackled the
                        stronghold of a higher classmate. The first attack was in the dressing room
                        and the conversation that was so absorbing that we both forgot and missed
                        the classes at which we were due. So for the succeeding years the two
                        Marions discussed the philosophies of the Western peoples, Kant's "Critique
                        of Pure Reason" and so on. A picture of myself was brought to my ears
                        through a friend of Marion's who caught sight of me getting in a street car
                        with a big drafting board and tee square with - "I saw your picturesque
                        friend getting on the car with her big drafting board utterly
                        unselfconscious though all eyes were turned on her." It took the journey to
                        the antipodes in later years to shake the fixed concepts of the northern,
                        the continental, hemisphere and to melt to the fluid of the southern
                        hemisphere these bare bones of science with which our people rest so
                        satisfied these days.</p>
                    <p>In all these many and varied friendships it was usually they who were the</p>
                    <pb n="157"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 157 ====]</p>
                    <p>initiators. This does not mean that I did not have a very great affection for
                        these wonderful friends, but my shyness perhaps in self-expression never
                        broke down except once. With that man of mine it seemed that I was
                        possessed. It was as if a demon took hold and shaped me to its whim. Indeed
                        years before a friend in the office had said the surmises were that I must
                        have been disappointed in love because I took my work so earnestly. I was
                        devoted to my work and indeed throughout my life have been convinced that
                        work is the one great satisfaction for human beings which means that those
                        women who have not grown up to take a life's work seriously as our men do
                        are being deprived of life's greatest continuous satisfaction. But when I
                        encountered Walter Burley Griffin I was first swept off my feet by my
                        delight in his achievements in my profession, then through a common bond of
                        interests in nature and intellectual pursuits and then with the man himself.
                        It was by no means a case of love at first sight but it was a madness when
                        it struck.</p>
                    <p>The many years were packed full of every joy and every anguish till that
                        demon who sat on my shoulder seemed to have run his gamut of possibilities
                        in work and play together and finally through that curious conflict of
                        interests, perhaps best expressed as a warfare of philosophies, Nietzsche
                        was a bone of contention between us, this man who like Kant would prove one
                        thing on one page and its opposite on the next, masters of reason both of
                        them going insane, makes a god of it, it leaves one with no ground to stand
                        on, for anything that can be proved can be disproved. The only basis for <hi
                            rend="ul">knowledge</hi> is perception, checkable perception. Not till
                        the battle had been fought out to a finish was it possible to realize that
                        the close companionship of marriage is the best training ground for that
                        demon - the Ego - which presently finds it cannot continue to endure
                        submission to any of the external worlds - neither that of the environment
                        itself, nor that of the physical body in which it has incarnated - these two
                        realms of law; nor to that other external world, the chaotic world of its
                        soul. And with a wrench from</p>

                        all these bondages. Then can the companionship be resumed on apparently the
                        same old terms but really a completely new thing for each has found that
                        through this battle, really with one's own self, one has developed faculties
                        which open the way to perception in a new world where one is no longer a
                        slave to anything external to his real self, his own Ego, but can make
                        contact with the formative forces which make it possible for him to be the
                        master of himself, of his thinking, feeling and willing. He finds that life
                        is no longer filled with problems impossible of solution; that he no longer
                        has to grant that he can have knowledge only in limited fields but that if
                        he will take the pains he can gain the means of solving all the problems of
                        his time. This is of course a necessity for the people of each period if the
                        evolution of humanity is to be a real thing.</p>
                    <p>In 1930 at the end of that character testing decade of one's forties
                            <note>fifties?</note>which followed the seven year battle over Canberra,
                        I threw up my hands and ran away, this time to America. My parting words to
                        Walt were - "Well now you are a free man." His to me - "I'm a perfect damn
                        fool."</p>
                    <p>In 1931 I wrote (from the United States to Australia) - In his cycle on the
                        Threshold of the Spiritual World, <note>Rudolf</note> Steiner says:- "In
                        love when one really loves a person there exists in the depths of his being
                        a terrible antipathy to that person. The antipathy is there if the love is
                        real love."</p>
                    <p>This is the only statement I have ever heard anyone make that seemed to me
                        true and significant except one that Emily Bronte made in which she said
                        that if she really loved a man she would hate him as she hated herself. I
                        myself as you may remember have said that it was absurd to look upon the
                        marital relationship, if it were based on love, as having any relation to
                        friendship, that it was more like that of enemies. I have told Clarmyra
                            <note>MMG's niece</note> that one should not choose a mate as a friend
                        but as an opponent, an opportunity worthy of her mettle. This statement of
                        Steiner's would seem to imply that love - that there was</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 160 ====]</p>
                    <p>such a thing as real love - and that it was based on a spiritual reality,
                        perhaps a need that could be met only by interdependence (This is our old
                        quarrel isn't it) a need of course not connected with physical needs.

                    <p>In 1932 - Dear Edith, You ask, "Can it be Marion that he doesn't understand?
                        Is it that he really has not seen?" In a way that is the case. He won't see
                        and what he won't see he can't see.</p>
                    <p>You didn't quite get the point in regard to anger as you will see when you
                        read the lecture. One should boil with anger. There must be anger. It is the
                        fire that Prometheus brought down to mankind. It is the divine force that
                        makes possible the balanced development of the Ego which is necessary for
                        its continued existence. One can and should make better and better use of
                        that force and should learn to transmute it into better judgments for the
                        solution of life's riddles. <note>Rudolf</note> Steiner says that without
                        the molding force of anger through which the Ego becomes richer and richer,
                        the Ego reaches a point where it begins to weaken and disintegrate and that
                        is the point where I think Walter stands.</p>
                    <p>I sometimes think Walter lacks the capacity for anger. I could suggest a trap
                        to set for him to test out this point but I do not believe in testing human
                        beings. But this is what Steiner says. He says that there are people who say
                        they make a sacrifice in not being angry, but they can't sacrifice what they
                        haven't got. The anger must exist. He says that one can over and over again
                        transmute anger into judgment but the anger must exist or it can't be
                        transmuted. That with this work of the Ego in transmuting anger it develops
                        the qualities that are necessary for its perfection and permanence. That
                        with this there comes a tranquility of soul and a power, but without this
                        interplay it becomes cold and hard.</p>
                    <p>Once, the first year we were in Australia, Walter was angry - or shocked -
                        when one of his backers on becoming a member of the Legislative assembly (a
                        permanent office like the House of Lords in England) said he</p>

                        a great comfort to me and I have tried since to convince myself that at
                        times since then he was angry because it seemed to me gruesome, not human,
                        never to be angry. But he never has been and has looked upon that as a sign
                        of his perfection as compared to myself. Just as when I said that I could
                        see in myself the capacity to do any or all evil things and felt that that
                        was the basis of a capacity for sympathy with humans in general, he looked
                        at me with shocked eyes as an evil thing feeling that his lack of any such
                        perception in himself was another basis of his perfection. But Steiner says
                        in his lecture on the Mystery of Death - "No self knowledge is true unless
                        it discloses to the depth where the tendency to all possible wrong-doing
                        dwells in us. This tendency is implanted in us in order that we may grasp
                        spiritual life with the Consciousness soul."</p>
                    <p>I quite realize that this characteristic of Walter's has been a very valuable
                        one in the frightful struggle he has had in his profession in Australia and
                        that perhaps the Angels have safeguarded him for that great work but I feel
                        very sure that the time has now come when his problem is life and not
                        architecture and that he should shake up this perfectly clean consciousness
                        of his and be able to see himself and others in truth and reality. To Walter
                        all human beings, except this wife, are exactly like himself, perfect, and
                        he never gets outside of himself in his estimate of them. This he looks upon
                        as a virtue but it is really an incapacity to see the truth.</p>
                    <p>And in 1932 - Well Walter Burley, that's that. Your truly human letter

                    <p>know from words out of your own mouth that you do not think Steiner upholds
                        Nietzsche's concept that freedom consists in not doing what your wife wants
                        you to do. This letter is not being written in solemnity but in lightness of
                        heart. Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>In the early professional days I was profoundly influenced by the Single Tax
                        of Henry George and only many years later realized that this concept of
                        freeing natural resources from absolute ownership of individuals needed to
                        be supplemented with a realization that also they must not be owned by the
                        community, the State. Ownership is a very different thing from the right to
                        use. It is for the State to see to it that equity is maintained in the use
                        of land. Its function is also to safeguard the land - nature - for the
                        future not only for men but for all God's creatures. We must not continue
                        our killing of the Earth.</p>
                    <p>In later years as member of the Single Tax Association in Melbourne with
                        their group established in a city building of their own through the
                        enterprise of Griffin, we witnessed the illuminating spectacle of the
                        difference in feeling between the American and the Britisher. One of the
                        finest thinkers and the most successful teacher of the Single Tax I have
                        ever known, Mr. Renwick, debated one evening with an opponent who made just
                        one point and kept returning to it throughout the evening and it was a
                        pathetic spectacle to see Mr. Renwick and all his convictions go down under
                        this onslaught for he had a son who had been killed in the war. The one
                        point was that with the Single Tax established the Empire could not continue
                        to exist and Mr. Renwick could see this and could not tolerate the idea and
                        in a soul battle taking place before our eyes that night the Empire won. Mr.
                        Renwick never recovered from that defeat of his higher self played out on
                        the stage of his soul. He died not long after.</p>

                    <p>thought on community affairs by the members of his congregation on whose
                        corns he might be stepping, so ultimately he left his Chicago church and for
                        many years continued his preaching in Evanston making no charge to the
                        little group who gathered around him. They finally felt they were in a
                        position to contribute to his support but he suggested that they use the
                        funds to build a little church. I had by that time graduated from
                            <note>Boston</note> Tech in Architecture and had had some years of
                        practical training in office work. He suggested me as architect to which
                        they agreed but they also selected a board of directors. This is one of the
                        stupid methods general in our community which arises from the misplacing of
                        the democratic ideal for in neither Economic nor Ability realms can
                        democracy be applied. Decisions made by a majority vote in such matters
                        cannot be correct. They are compromises. Such points as costs limitations
                        would of course be established to begin with.</p>
                    <p>The privilege of the choice of the architect in this case was properly
                        granted to Mr. Blake since he desired to make that decision. He was in a
                        true sense their leader and they were under obligations to him. He had had
                        experience with my capacity as an artist, and beauty was one of the
                        requirements of his religion; and he knew my qualifications. The board as
                        usual, especially as it contained an architect, took pride and satisfaction
                        in continual obstruction. Indeed how else can a board feel that it is
                        fulfilling its function.</p>
                    <p>I had yielded on various points one requiring a complete new design. They had
                        turned down my first which Mr. Blake realized later was a pity. The design
                        was an octagonal motif and an unprejudiced solution of the problem. The
                        second design was more conventional. Mr. Blake once asked me if I couldn't
                        yield on this point or that point but I told him that if I yielded on the
                        points they were making it would mean a total destruction of beauty in the
                        building. Finally they suggested that we go with them to inspect a certain
                        chapel, which we did. As we went around the building Mr. Blake kept saying -
                        "But why have you brought us here? I couldn't preach a sermon in such a
                        place as this."</p>

                    <p>And so on. As he and I went home together I said to Mr. Blake, "Did you
                        notice the height of this wall?" "Yes." "Well that is the dimension they
                        were requiring of me." "You don't say so." "And did you notice this and
                        that?" "Yes." "Well that is what they were requiring of me." "Do you mean,"
                        he said, "they wanted you to duplicate that building?" "Yes," I said,
                        "that's what they wanted." "You don't say so," said he. From that time on he
                        stood absolutely by me, and the board had to accept those decisions. It was
                        he who said that Marion would have a hard time if she married a man who was
                        not honest. My destiny proved that that was not a discipline required of me

                        matter how great an antipathy one may have to a system utterly different
                        from that to which one has been accustomed, parliamentary versus
                        congressional, this does not at all diminish the closeness of the contact
                        with many wonderful individuals nor does it affect the strength and beauty
                        of the bonds made with them. Enemies we had not known before, but from now
                        on we were surrounded by bitter enemies as well as beloved friends for the

                        whole British Empire, against all the financial interests, against the big
                        business interests of Melbourne and Sydney, and against the Bureaucracy. Now
                        indeed I was bound to the work.</p>
                    <p>On that biggest of the islands of the South Seas, wonderful friends found me
                        tied though I was to the office and the drafting board all through the
                        years. In Melbourne Lillian <note>Hamilton</note> Moore and Mrs. Paling and
                        their various groups of friends where the questions of war and democracy
                        were discussed without prejudice throughout the duration of the 1st World
                        War. Another lifelong friend was young Adela Pankhurst, still in her teens
                        who, in that first year of the war published her book "Put Up The Sword" so
                        full of valuable historical information. Though it was banned during the war
                        I had it on my shelves where it was always accessible. She herself was one
                        of that trinity including Cardinal <note>Archbishop Daniel</note> Mannix and
                        Walter Burley Griffin which really saved Australia from conscription, a very
                        different thing in Parliamentary communities than in Congressional
                        communities. She was a real orator with unlimited vitality. We spent a lot
                        of time trying to convert her from communism, really but another form of
                        dictatorship, bureaucratic dictatorship. Later her own experience converted
                        her. But still she did not realize that the Parliamentary form is completely
                        bureaucratic.</p>
                    <p>In Sydney so many friends and so wonderful, now moving toward a common center
                        from which one could grasp the earth and humanity as a totality. The first
                        step toward this center was the putting into my hands by a Quaker (who had
                        been in charge of relief in Russia at the</p>

                        suffragist Emmeline and a sister of two of the movement's leaders, Sylvia
                        and Christabel. Estranged from her family, Adela moved to Australia in 1914.</note>

                        admit from the outside world even for such a purpose) a book which changed
                        me completely from a pessimist to an optimist, the Outline of Occult Science
                        by Rudolf Steiner which led to my joining some time later the Society
                        founded by him - the only Christian occultism for all other occult movements
                        are Asiatic. Rosicrucianism was Christian but has turned to the East. Before
                        then I had been saying what a pity the Lord, who had created the wonderful
                        beauty of stone and bush and animal, had made the fatal mistake of creating
                        man who devoted all his energies to destroying these beauties. But now I
                        grasped this reversal of things and realized that, instead of man's standing
                        at the top of a tree of evolution through these kingdoms, they had all,
                        mineral and vegetable and animal, derived through the eons from him. Surely
                        there was some more constructive, creative work he should be undertaking
                        now. From this standpoint it was possible to attain a basic purpose for
                        life. "Then," as Albert Steffen says, "One's enthusiasm for the SHAPING OF
                        DESTINY gains more and more the upper hand over every other desire."</p>

                            >man's wisdom</hi>. This opened up the real way to make friends with the
                        children whose lives are being parched by the arid teaching of our present
                        communities. Parents began sending their children to me when they asked
                        those "impossible questions." Even 5 year old Glyn <note>Nicholls?</note>

                        I said, "But we are friends - friends do things for each other. I do things
                        for you and you do things for me," and so he did.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. <note>Walter?</note> Lippmann,</p>
                    <p>16 February 1945</p>
                    <p>Since my return from Australia you are the only American I have heard
                        correctly state the essential of the American constitution - the separation
                        of the Executive from the Legislative (The Chicago Sun, 15 February 1945.)
                        May I quote your article in a book I am writing on what an American learns
                        in Australia.</p>
                    <p>Among the larger units there are just two countries which have honest
                        governments - America which makes democracy possible and Russia which is
                        frankly a bureaucratic government. If found undesirable it can be altered.
                        The other European countries are parading in the guise of democracies but in
                        fact give the people no chance at all.</p>
                    <p>I hope you can find time to read the enclosed Congressional versus
                        Parliamentary Government. I hope that you dwell on these points continually
                        as the future of the world depends on understanding these differences. An
                        illustration of how helpless the people and their representatives are is the
                        story of <note>Winston</note> Churchill. Though I do not know the facts in
                        this instance our repeated experience of similar things makes me sure this
                        is just what happened. It is typical. If India now forming does not
                        contemplate selection of president directly by the people the confusion of
                        Europe will be hers. <note>The last sentence is handwritten and inserted
                            into the text.</note></p>
                    <p>In the early days of the war Churchill, feeling America's support might hang
                        on the handling of India, sent <note>Sir Stafford</note> Cripps to India. He
                        must have authorized something that he would agree to if India would. Cripps
                        arrived and the Indians did agree to the suggestion but 2 days later the
                        cable came saying - "It can't be done." Now how could that happen! Well this
                        is how that sort of thing does happen repeatedly. Churchill was Prime
                        Minister. He had not yet been initiated to toe the mark as
                        <note>Ramsay</note> MacDonald the Labor Leader had been previously. He
                        thought he held a position of authority.</p>
                    <note>Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) was a newspaper columnist and author and one
                        of the most widely read political commentators of his time.</note>
                    <pb n="173"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 173 ====]</p>
                    <p>However some Civil Servant had to type out the stuff he had sent Cripps. This
                        secretary's first allegiance would not be to the Prime Minister but to his
                        superior Civil Servants so he passed the information on. Thereupon an
                        official (permanent of course) came to Churchill and said - "But Mr.
                        Churchill that can't be done." So Churchill knew he must either pass that
                        message to Cripps or have the government thrown out of office, and a new
                        election. He can perhaps be excused for not being honest as M.
                        <note>Raymond</note> Poincare (who after all was President) had been in the
                        previous war, and successfully as it happened in that one case, where he
                        defied the whole Masonic Organization and got a Catholic - Foche
                            <note>Ferdinand Foch</note> - to accept the leadership or the army on
                        his terms. (I could tell you that tale in detail if you wanted to use it.)
                        But Churchill toed the line feeling I suppose the importance at the moment
                        and the risks in the change in the party control in Parliament. So he toed
                        the line.</p>

                    <p>Caption</p>
                    <p>The present world emergency brings into the clear that the United Nations can
                        best function by taking as a first step co-operation between America and
                        India for Europe is incapable of making decisions since she is still bound
                        to physical concepts - the impulses of the body. She is willful,
                        uncontrolled by feeling or thinking, highly intellectual but lacking in
                        moral or economic fundaments.</p>
                    <p>The soundest way to avoid another World War would be a swift co-operation
                        between the extremes - the orient and the occident whose mutual advantage
                        would not tend toward imperialism but toward true democracy, mutual
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>America is already established on a moral concept - equity - and India would
                        be glad to co-operate in the economic realm with America working toward a
                        planned economy not bureaucratically controlled.</p>
                    <p>Willful Europe, thoroughly materialistic and bureaucratically controlled will
                        be slow in adjusting herself to a World Organization.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="ul"> ARCHITECTURE</hi> - Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>In every department of human progress there have been long periods of groping
                        effort, a certain amount of human accomplishment largely attributed to
                        inspiration and a consequent vanity in those supposed to be inspired, and
                        hero worship by the rest, a large amount of imitation on the part of others
                        but no steady progression in the field till finally the underlying
                        principles begin to become apparent, the laws are investigated, the whole is
                        brought with in the scope of the intelligence. Then the accomplishments in
                        this particular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with
                        amazement at the results.</p>
                    <p>We have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of
                        development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but
                        the development of this wonderful field was very slow till the law - a
                        purely mathematical one - of the conservation of rhythm - was understood.
                        When we learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves
                        with each other and the consequent destruction of sound and that the sounds
                        that we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each
                        other so that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a
                        development of the art of music which is one of the miracles of the present
                        time. A hundred years has done what all the thousand of years preceding did
                        not begin to do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learn
                        this fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the
                        controlling law.</p>
                    <p>Music is a time art measured by rhythm. To satisfy the human soul these units
                        must be preserved and must be so used as to reinforce each other, for
                        destruction is painful to us but evidences of continuity are a joy and
                        inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law.
                        Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made
                        conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elements in our present
                        creation, and in</p>

                    <p>being made aware of infinity through the preservation of rhythm, as in
                        architecture and landscape architecture which are but interdependent
                        elements of one field, we rejoice in being made conscious of space and can
                        be satisfied only when the space units we use reinforce each other and a
                        feeling of spaciousness is obtained. In a building or in a community a
                        huddle and a clutter of unrelated units is as distressing as a harsh sound.</p>
                    <p>Let us illustrate this principle so simple yet so vital, capable of so many
                        and so varied results. The first problem in this field is that of the
                        smallest unit in our life today, one family. We take it in its simplest
                        distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and
                        conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its
                        industrial development to provide effective shelter and comfortable living,
                        though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use
                        utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we
                        are making of the conservation of space. Every family requires provision for
                        the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the
                        bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any
                        other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom.
                        Similarly the working quarters should be isolated, and so concentrated as to
                        save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in
                        closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private
                        needs the quarters to be used in common should be so arranged as to help
                        each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving
                        feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary
                        we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that
                        would be required for a small living room and a small dining room as one
                        room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is
                        empty and vice verse. With a little more leeway,</p>

                    <p>putting the two rooms together in the form of an L adds a little bit of
                        mystery. With a house a bit larger a half story level scheme given
                        opportunity for a large living room with high ceiling which its greater
                        proportions prevent being inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library
                        opening out from the higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these
                        rooms and a delightful feeling of openness to the whole. This arrangement is
                        very economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages
                        of both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation
                        in the heights of the ceiling of those of various sizes eliminating the
                        unpleasant proportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same
                        level from large rooms to small rooms, and at the same time getting the
                        feeling of openness and distance, an in addition an emphasis as pleasing in
                        building as in any art.</p>
                    <p>From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two
                        families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work
                        together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by
                        intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one
                        of the streets of Evanston where the lots and houses of approximately the
                        same size are all placed at the same distance from the other, the only idea
                        being to get the most out of one's own lot no matter what the consequences
                        to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look crowded and cramped for yard
                        space, till we come to two houses that were built at the same time with the
                        intention of making a bit of music, instead or noise. Here in spite of the
                        fact that the size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that
                        there is ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses
                        have thrown their open space together, and have located themselves on the
                        further sides of their respective lots. This means of course that an
                        architectural problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house
                        may have equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about</p>

                        houses on either side , is to place the pair of houses close together as
                        possible eliminating the garden space between them and reversing the
                        location of the porch of one to make an effective unit of the pair.</p>

                    <p>this if one is but willing to take the pains. It means of course that the one
                        house cannot as a rule be a duplicate of the other. With this arrangement
                        each house has an open space to look out on twice the size of what it has
                        with the other method. The manner of solving this problem varies with the
                        size of the lots, and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there
                        is always an advantage to be gained by working together.</p>
                    <p>Allen Ravines <note>Decatur, Illinois</note> was the pleasant problem of a
                        piece of property owned by a family <note>the Mueller family</note> of
                        brothers who, with their wives and children, wanted cottages for their
                        summer outings, and decided to build on this charmingly picturesque bit of
                        woodland. Each family by this arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be
                        built so as to destroy as little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to
                        get as great a view as possible of the river with trails leading to each
                        cabin from the large building nearer the main road which serves for
                        accommodation house and entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is
                        the common garage and caretaker's home in connection with which is the farm
                        for raising vegetables, fruit, etc., for the whole group.</p>
                    <p>Next is the small suburban group far enough out from the city center to make
                        land values low enough to use for garden farming - a group of five farms
                            <note>Emory group, Wheaton, Illinois</note> with buildings so placed as
                        to bring service portions together making it possible to emphasize the
                        park-like effect of the whole.</p>
                    <p>We are able now to make some comparisons that will in a rather surprising way
                        illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing
                        together of sounds does not constitute the making of music, so in Town
                        planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as
                        anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have
                        all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and this
                        law of conservation of space has been observed as in music the sound wave
                        must be conserved. Some illustrations will make this clear.</p>

                    <p>Ridge Quadrangles <note>Evanston, Illinois</note> is a really startling
                        example of what a little geometry will do. I shall not blame anyone who
                        refuses to believe what I say because we ourselves could not believe our
                        eyes till we measured and counted over and over again. However we have had
                        similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of
                        course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more
                        economical is the result in terms of cold cash. In other words it is only
                        when we work for ideal ends that we achieve practical results. When brought
                        into the office it had been laid out as shown by the small scale drawing.
                        The alley so unnecessary in a residence district had been left out. It was
                        the intention to build two-family apartments on all the 50 foot lots. The
                        long axis of the houses was placed parallel to the street and the houses
                        staggered giving light and outlook on 3 or 4 directions instead of the usual
                        2. By substituting domestic ways for one thoroughfare and somewhat
                        diminishing the depth of lots one acre parks in the smaller blocks and a
                        five acre park in the larger block were obtained. The increased value given
                        to all the lots would probably build a comfortable club house.</p>
                    <p>In contrast with this residence subdivision on perfectly flat land is the one
                        at Grinnell <note>Iowa</note> where the somewhat rolling ground of the town
                        as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking
                        illustration of the impractical nature of the so-called practical ways of
                        doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues
                        fails to see beyond its nose and, curiously enough, fails in consequence to
                        accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact
                        that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the
                        parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having
                        decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives
                        him the best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the
                        straight streets across this property, and had actually sold</p>
                    <pb n="184"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 184 ====]</p>
                    <p>several lots before he realized the difficulty he was getting into, for when
                        it came to putting in service, as sewers bumping up hill and down dale with
                        the streets it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the
                        pipes for the higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or
                        there would be backing up of the sewage in the lower houses. So the problem
                        was brought to a technical man for solution. By making the streets follow
                        the bottom of the ravines these difficulties and extravagances were entirely
                        overcome. By recognition of the nature of the location which made it
                        essentially a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide
                        pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that
                        instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66, that
                        is 9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the
                        average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there
                        was an increase of 30% in the salable frontage which, taking the prices
                        previously set increased the profits of the sale by $15,000. In addition all
                        the houses were located on the higher land, none in the hole, and the whole
                        took on the look of a park and became in consequence the most attractive
                        district in the town.</p>
                    <p>And so it goes. In Vanderhoof, <note>British Columbia,</note> Canada,
                        desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first
                        ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they were laying
                        out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with
                        cross streets necessitating steep gardens in numerous cases and with no park
                        space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated even if the
                        profits are to be increased but again that was not the case.</p>
                    <p>By placing the civic center and municipal centers so that they could be
                        reached directly by a system of radiating streets following the ravines many
                        of the gross <note>cross?</note> streets became entirely unnecessary,</p>
                    <pb n="185a"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 185a ====]</p>
                    <p>easy gradients were obtained everywhere, the depths of the blocks were
                        increased till almost without exception all the blocks had interior parks,
                        while at the same time the private allotments were increased from 130' to
                        150' in depth, and when the count of lots was made there were still as many

                    <p>PLAYGROUNDS FOR THE CHILDREN</p>
                    <p>If the civilization of a people can be measured by the happiness of its
                        children, all of its children, and the opportunities opened to them for full
                        development of all their faculties, physical, mental and spiritual, then
                        very low indeed does the civilization of our people fall when measured by
                        this standard.</p>
                    <p>The religion of democracy requires that the opportunities for complete
                        development shall be open on even terms to all human beings born into this
                        earthly sphere. The basis essential for accomplishing this is that natural
                        resources - made by no man therefore no man's property - should be open to
                        the use of all. In a society based on this simple justice all children would
                        find ample facilities for such constant contact with nature as to assure
                        them physical health, mental stimulus and moral enlightenment.</p>
                    <p>Failing in this, the least we can do is to provide all children with access
                        to open spaces for the play which is a vital necessity for their
                        development; especially when we find that such playgrounds can be provided
                        without any increased expenditure at all.</p>
                    <p>The accompanying are illustrations of two methods of subdivisions of city
                        property, one the generally accepted method providing no playground space at
                        all except the streets, and the other providing such playground space. The
                        slight modification as shown in this illustration gives playground space in
                        direct connection with every home, five acres in the interior of the large
                        block and one acre in each of the smaller blocks. This increase in common
                        playground space is obtained by modification of the street system which
                        leaves the same number of allotments on which are the same number of houses
                        of the same dimensions, and slightly diminishing the depth of the
                        allotments.</p>
                    <p>In this subdivision there is ample provision for thorough traffic in the
                        exterior roads. The domestic uses to which the property is put renders the
                        cross road unnecessary for rapid traffic and becomes</p>

                    <p>purely a menace to the children, an expense in useless pavement, a nuisance
                        in barrenness and dust.</p>
                    <p>The rearrangement, recognizing the domestic character of the district, while
                        keeping the opposite building lines the full 60' apart to maintain as much
                        openness as in the case of the wider street, reduces the width of pavement
                        to that required by the service of a domestic community. By placing the
                        buildings crosswise instead of lengthwise and staggering them, instead of
                        getting light on only the two narrow sides of the building, we get light,
                        ventilation and outlook from at least three and usually four sides of the
                        residence, giving every lot, through this openness, the appearance and
                        advantages of greater size.</p>
                    <p>This arrangement places the playgrounds under the eye of every mother, and no
                        street has to be crossed by the children in reaching it. Since these
                        playgrounds have no street frontage and have not increased the lengths of
                        the streets and service systems, these playgrounds have cost nothing and the
                        money saved by the decreased pavement required can be used for the
                        development and upkeep of these parks.</p>
                    <p>One of these lots can well be used for a community House for the use of the
                        whole neighborhood giving facilities for reading, music, drama, dancing.</p>
                    <p>When we realize that such advantages can be gained in our communities with no
                        increased expenditure our neglect to provide our community with lungs
                        becomes inexcusable.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 192 ====]</p>
                    <p>So far these things seem so apparent, so inevitable that we wonder why they
                        haven't always been done. Their not having been done simply goes to show
                        that human beings amble through life without bothering to think. What we
                        usually dub thinking in an off hand way is purely an automatic process.
                        Indeed even highly developed reasoning may become automatic. But here we are
                        not considering ordinary thinking but creative thinking, thinking which
                        diverges from the straight beaten paths into curves, devious, surprising,
                        charming; thinking that calls for action and consummation in deeds. We must
                        learn to think in terms of the future.</p>
                    <p>But now we meet with magic. Nature is so full of magic that one wonders how
                        men can be so hum-drum. But it is only because man standing as he does
                        outside of nature can choose either way, the stupid or the inspired. Here it
                        was that I was awakened to the magic that can lie in town planning if it
                        escapes from the boundaries of what is being done.</p>
                    <p>The plan as originally brought to Mr. Griffin for co-operative development
                        for 200 families in 100 two family buildings had, to be sure, eliminated the
                        wasteful alley giving that much additional living outdoor space. A common
                        heating plant for the group was also incorporated which facilitated other
                        community services. An equipment duct extended continuously through the
                        basements of the buildings involving no additional excavation, obviating not
                        only street pipes but all stubs and connections, accessible throughout,
                        conservative of heat and preventing of all leakage of other forms of energy
                        or deterioration of the pipes.</p>
                    <p>Griffin gave one look at it and handed it over to me with instructions to
                        carry the center street only half way and there put a transverse street
                        across the property, reducing the widths of these streets since they were no
                        longer thoroughfares, and to make the lots 100 feet deep. I did so and found
                        there had sprung up three interior parks, seven acres in all. I counted the
                        number of houses, now</p>

                    <p>staggered instead of all on one building line and found there were the same
                        number, including the clubhouse, as in the original plan which had no park
                        space nor but a tiny alley like strip if you reduced the lot depths to 100
                        feet. Thinking I must have counted wrong I added them again. The same
                        answer. I presented it to Mr. Griffin expressing my astonishment but there
                        was no surprise there. It was, "Yes of course." It took no more than that to
                        make me accept immediately when it was later presented to me, the fact that
                        the Spirits of Mathematics are the great primeval creative Spirits - the
                        Elohim.</p>
                    <p>The site of Ridge Quadrangles <note>Evanston, Illinois</note> is a sylvan
                        plane <note>plain?</note> with oak forest extending across one of those sand
                        spit bars that mark the former existence of the lake or sea over the Chicago
                        district, in this case some 20 feet above the general level about it.</p>
                    <p>The scheme is co-operative in just the same way and to the same extent as is
                        the ordinary apartment building of ten or a dozen stories sandwiched into
                        the turmoil of the city itself. But in addition to these ordinary
                        co-operative advantages of heat, light and water and care are those of its
                        own recreation grounds and club house and smokeless service plant. The
                        clubhouse in which all householders have a joint interest is a country club
                        and family club available the year around and in within a few steps of each
                        of the 1,000 community population.</p>
                    <p>We see how unnecessary is the deadly routine of the usual thing done for here
                        again, though the houses are of the same size as those in the original with
                        the outlook on only two sides, here every house has outlook on three sides
                        and most of them on four sides, to say nothing of the park views for all,
                        and recreational space as well as the quiet and safety achieved by getting
                        rid of one thoroughfare; and its entrances shut of <note>off?</note> by
                        intersectional park circles with their plantings and reflecting pools.</p>

                        shattered.</p>

                        glimpsed the fact that, though rational thinking does not suffice for the
                        solving of life problems, there can be creative thinking.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago rational thinking was discovered by two men independently,
                        Abraham and Aristotle. That kind of thinking sufficed for a millennium or
                        two, supplemented occasionally by genius (a kind of intuitive thinking,
                        really a gift of the gods). Nowadays no one understands intuitive thinking
                        so the gods are ceasing to give these gifts. Now we have to learn them. And
                        rational thinking cannot solve life's problems. Rational thinking was
                        necessary for a period to accomplish a quite different end, to make freedom
                        possible. But now the creation of a new type of thinking is as urgent as the
                        creation of rational thinking was for the periods beginning with Abraham and
                        Aristotle.</p>
                    <p>To comprehend totalitarianism it is necessary, as with all polarities, to
                        know its polar opposite. Without down there can be no up, nor an inside
                        without an outside nor matter without spirit.</p>
                    <p>Totalitarianism is but the latest phase of Hebraic thinking, of rational
                        thinking. To get rid of Hebraic thinking, if current methods were to be
                        generally adopted, one would have to banish from the earth all westerners as
                        versus Easterners whose gods are multiple whereas the western God is unity,
                        the God of Abraham, the God of nature, the Father God. This oneness is the
                        God to which logical thinking leads us. It is the Hebraic as versus the
                        Christian God. With the coming of the Christ the <hi rend="ul">concept</hi>
                        of Threeness arose in religion. Two thousand years have passed and men have
                        not grasped it yet. For some 1,500 years faith sufficed to carry humanity,
                        but the last 500 years have destroyed the power of faith. Rational thinking
                        has no place for faith and under</p>

                    <p>the domination of logic our human communities are now disintegrating. Our
                        only sound foundation, the next step in evolution to succeed faith, is
                        knowledge, and rational thinking does not lead to knowledge, it leads only
                        to self-confidence, a necessary step in evolution as it is the basis of <hi
                            rend="ul">free will</hi>, but free will can function only destructively
                        unless supplemented by <hi rend="ul">knowledge</hi>. That is the twoness,
                        the duality, essential for this period of human evolution.</p>
                    <p>Now what is the present foundation stone of knowledge? It is the concept of
                        trinity. The primordial concept of Trinity was the gift of the God Christ.
                        (In the period of the Greek civilization.) All knowledge derives from
                        concepts. Animals cannot gain knowledge because only to man was that
                        primordial concept directly given, the concept - causality. That was the
                        gift of the Father God and through perception (also directly given) all
                        nature is the school through which we can gradually come to a comprehension
                        of causality, oneness. Two was the number first created, the creator and the
                        created - two. (Before that there was neither unity nor multiplicity.) From
                        this we derive the concept of one. With these developed we can attain to
                        threeness numerically first and later, with divine help, to Trinity which
                        constitutes a true unity, as in a circle which consists of a center, a
                        radius of definite length and a circumference - a true unity.</p>
                    <p>The gift of the Christ was the concept of the Primordial Trinity - the
                        Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (that light which lighteth every man
                        that cometh into the world). From that time there ceased to be different
                        races, only individual differences.</p>
                    <p>So the polar opposite of Totalitarianism, of oneness, is Trinity, true unity.
                        The time is ripe for our developing our Societies on Christian instead of
                        Hebraic lines. And nowhere do we see that being done for all our states by
                        whatever name they are being called, are Totalitarian. They divide into two
                        groups, one efficient and so arresting our attention and very convincing to
                        our logical habits of</p>

                        France, consciously or unconsciously moving toward the logical conclusion.</p>
                    <p>In all alike there is no way for the three functions of a society to carry on
                        in accordance with their own peculiar necessities and laws. We have however
                        an example of the healthy working of a trinity placed before us in the
                        constitution of man himself where the Father God, whose gift is natural man,
                        has established the assimilative and limb system to do the work of the body
                        as it does in the animal; where the Christ has given us the heart system to
                        maintain balance, equity; where the Holy Spirit has given us the head and
                        nerve system to develop pure thinking and to comprehend brotherhood.</p>
                    <p>With this pattern before us we should at least be willing to accept as proved
                        that a trinity is practical and workable and in the face of the chaos about
                        us give it a trial, and nowhere are conditions so favorable for a trial as
                        in America, the land of adventurers.</p>
                    <p>You will notice that man has no central organization. He is not a being who
                            <hi rend="ul">has</hi> but a being who <hi rend="ul">consists of the
                            interplay</hi> of three independently functioning organizations, body,
                        soul, and spirit, though the fruits of the activities of each are used by
                        all. So must it be for health in a human society, as so must it be with a
                        circle, or a tonic chord.</p>
                    <p>Abraham's rational thinking led him to a oneness as God, and to this religion
                        we are still subscribers, unity as versus multiplicity, the West versus the
                        East.</p>
                    <p>Aristotle's thinking led him into the material realm and his logic gave the
                        same answer there - causality. Both functioned in the realm of cause and
                        effect where cause precedes effect, the realm of rational thinking, one
                        centering on cause, the other on effect. But man does not belong here. He
                        forms a purpose. The effect precedes</p>
                    <pb n="199"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 199 ====]</p>
                    <p>the cause. The mineral kingdom lives in the past, the animal in the moment,
                        man in the future.</p>
                    <p>To these, the one the concept of the material, of the body, of individual
                        abilities, and the other the concept of cause, of thinking, of the
                        Spiritual, we must add the balance, the Christ, the concept of equity, of
                        morals. With the word "Altruism" more than a century old now, we should
                        begin to act on that concept and establish our societies accordingly, a
                        trinity with each organization manned by the whole citizenry of the country,
                        first a Political Organization whose function and only function is the
                        maintenance of Rights, that modern conception of equality of man in the
                        Rights realm.</p>
                    <p>Only so can man's moral nature function in the solution of social problems -
                        through having an organization which can express the moral standard of the
                        community, expressed by the majority, democratic in its form and not muddled
                        by conflicting elements which have their proper field elsewhere, as liberty,
                        but which have no place in the realm of equity, of morals. Thus it could
                        become apparent that the difficulties arising in the realm of capital derive
                        from lack of clear thinking. The problem is how to transform the <hi
                            rend="ul">circulation</hi> of capital, not its distribution, so that it
                        may not be something oppressive. The evils of capital derive not from
                        capital per se, not from its ownership by private individuals as versus
                        ownership by the community as a whole, or the State, but from its <hi
                            rend="ul">ownership</hi> as versus the right to <hi rend="ul">use</hi>
                        it. And we should grasp that capital, and so all the advantages that come
                        from it, can be created only by the spiritual capacities, or the abilities,
                        either spiritual or physical, of <hi rend="ul">individuals</hi> and
                        therefore that capital for use should be available for all ability, but not
                        ownership which would give the iniquitous (the inequitable) privilege to
                        individuals or State of placing capital in the hands of those who have not
                        the ability to use it advantageously, productively. Of all forms of
                        Capitalism, the State owned capital is the most disastrous</p>

                    <p>and ultimately can have no efficiency.</p>
                    <p>And so we should understand the necessity for a second organization, that of
                        Abilities, whose concern would be that everyone should be completely <hi
                            rend="ul">free</hi> to use his own abilities in his own way for only he
                        can have any means of knowing what they are or how they can be used. Ability
                        is a function of the individual, not of the state. This, the Body
                        Organization, would not concern itself at all with morals or equity. Its
                        whole interest, its whole value, is in the realm of Freedom which has no
                        connection with Equity.</p>
                    <p>The Political Organization, the State, the Moral Organization, would require
                        that capital be kept in constant use, as well as money.</p>
                    <p>The Trinity - man - consists of Spirit, Soul and Body, so in a Society a
                        third organization is essential, the Co-operative Organization holding a
                        middle position between the moral realm, that of Equity, that of the Christ,
                        and the realm of liberty, of man's rational thinking powers.</p>
                    <p>This Third Realm, that of buying and selling, is bounded on the one side by
                        Nature, the Christ (The Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof)
                        demanding in the last resort that <hi rend="ul">all</hi> men shall have
                        Equity in this realm; and on the other side by Capital which is the
                        manifestation of man's spirit in the material realm. This third realm is
                        where Thinking safeguards Nature. So we attain Equity, Fraternity and
                        Liberty each in its totality where it has any significance.</p>
                    <p>The realm of Abilities in form is necessarily hierarchical as ability derives
                        from the individual.</p>
                    <p>The realm of Economics is that of Mutuality and consists of the interplay of
                        multitudinous Economic Associations and, in its totality, contains exact
                        knowledge, based on experience, of all sides of Economic affairs. I sell to
                        you because it is to my advantage to get rid of it, you buy because it is of
                        advantage to you to have it.</p>

                    <p>Thus the alternative to <hi rend="ul">Totalitarianism</hi> is the <hi
                            rend="ul">Threefold Commonwealth</hi>. Through this we can satisfy the
                        moral requirements of our time based on <hi rend="ul">Equal Human
                        Rights</hi>, can attain complete Freedom in the use of individual abilities

                        enslaved community. We can have that which is not possible in a Totalitarian
                        State, democracy <hi rend="ul">and</hi> a planned community for the latter
                        is a function not of the Political but of the Economic Organ and can be
                        either national or international. With the control of money in this latter
                        and so constituted that it will grow old like the commodities it measures,
                        it will become a true medium of exchange and it will be possible to
                        establish true prices, for money in this realm cannot be played with for it
                        will not be based on abstract numbers as it is at present but expressed in
                        terms of tangible values, as so many pounds of wheat, etc., which will take
                        the curse out of it.</p>
                    <p>In order to attain economic efficiency, for a community to be efficient, it
                        is not necessary that individuals should <hi rend="ul">own</hi> capital
                        which method gives rise to a tendency to pass capital on to inefficient
                        people. What is necessary is that individuals should have the <hi rend="ul"
                            >use</hi> of capital. So the elimination of the ownership of capital so
                        long as it is complete and abolishes State ownership as well as private
                        ownership will bring about not only as efficient but a more efficient social
                        system. Access for use can and should be given in as large amounts as are
                        required for maximum efficiency. Thus if an entity has a function to
                        fulfill, it must have an organ to fulfill it. If it has 3 different
                        functions to fulfill it must have 3 organs to fulfill them. So it must be
                        with human societies. Thus is the conflict between the East and the West
                        brought to an end, the polarity resolved into a trinity, the Earth become a
                        true Unity. At the present moment the soundest step would be the
                        co-operation of America and Asia bringing together the Political and
                        Economic elements leaving the madness of Europe, the Will Group, to cool and
                        ultimately take its place in the WORLD ORGANIZATION.</p>

                            ARCHITECTS . AUSTRALIA</bibl>
                    </p>
                    <p>Engineering is the basis of architecture under the American system and has
                        been till very recently the dominating influence. The great advance that
                        architecture has made is not in the field of academic and scholastic
                        architecture but in engineering feats, and the complaint I have to register
                        is that these engineering feats have not been accompanied by adequate
                        architectural development, that they have not been led by architecture and
                        made to express architecture or the fundamentals of architecture. Our
                        education in architecture is a reminiscence of Feudalism, as Louis H.
                        Sullivan has expressed it, which is carrying into a time of democracy, the
                        real essential mental attitude of the Middle Ages, looking to authority for
                        our beliefs and thoughts. To my mind democracy should be the essential of
                        our thought. We have realized the democratic trend for a long time now in
                        politics especially but we have not begun to follow it into other phases of
                        life where the necessity is not so plain. Democracy as I define it is
                        independence of thought. Democracy in politics is independence of action,
                        but action must be dominated by thought, and unless our thought is
                        independent we are still in a feudalistic environment. The trouble with our
                        education is that it has brought conventions in as authority and these
                        conventions are the first thing that the student is taught. The first thing
                        that he is brought into contact with in architecture is the classic "order"
                        universal in European civilization. It was my own experience. I went through
                        the mill and I would probably have followed the lines others had if I had
                        not had the advantage of contact with an independent thinker in Chicago, Mr.
                        Louis H. Sullivan. His emphasis was always laid on the essential connection
                        between the structure and the use to which the building was to be put, and
                        the expression of it in form. In other words "Form follows function" is the
                        slogan Sullivan laid down years ago, evolved in his own experience
                            <note>following reading from N-YHS</note> gained in practice as a

                        for general laws.</p>
                    <p>The basis of my idea is an assumption that I have seen laid down that every
                        child born onto the earth is a genius in one of three directions, either as
                        a scientist in the observation of nature - an investigator of the truths of
                        nature - or an inventor - an experimenter and contriver of mechanical
                        processes - or an artist who gives form to these utilitarian things. And
                        teachers in the primary stages of education are willing to corroborate that
                        assumption. They find numerous evidences. There has been poetry composed by
                        immature children equal to anything that is written in the language, but a
                        few years of school training is all that is required to obliterate any
                        sparks of ingenuity or any gleam of truth of expression in those children.
                        They are taught that the other man has set an ideal, that the other man has
                        expressed a thought, and that he is unapproachable. After this has been
                        sufficiently impressed on the mind of the pupil it is enough to kill any
                        originality or freedom to do good work.</p>
                    <p>We have our necessities in construction which are well recognized. Our
                        materials have changed even in the last ten years. In the last 25 years
                        conditions have altered so completely from those of preceding times that we
                        can hardly find a way to adapt the preceding architecture to the present
                        conditions, yet the greatest ingenuity of architects of the present day is
                        just in that direction. The results are usually incongruous, very difficult
                        to explain or excuse. Nor with the idea that the Greek or Goth or some other
                        highly educated peoples have said the final word in architecture are we
                        going to be able to express our idea in steel and concrete. We are building
                        better buildings to-day, finer inside and out, then any people that we have
                        any knowledge of in history and yet we acknowledge that the architecture of
                        those buildings cannot approach anything in Medieval France or in Ancient
                        Greece. With that attitude we cannot</p>

                    <p>get very far ahead. I take it we shall have to abandon the hypothesis.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty is to put that into practice in the schools. I have heard it
                        said, "What would you do? Would you give students blank pieces of paper and
                        expect them to concoct magnificent designs forthwith without looking up the
                        books?" I would not expect anybody to create a magnificent design in the
                        beginning, and I do not think the pupil need to set out to do such a thing.
                        I was taught, and the education of my time was, that the students should
                        have big problems to work out to give themselves a chance to express the
                        best there was in architecture before they were forced to go into a life of
                        building warehouses, residences and railroad stations. I think the sequence
                        ought to be reversed. My first problem in actual practice was a poultry
                        house. (laughter) If I were to go in for teaching architecture I would put
                        that difficulty, or something similar, up to a pupil as his first example
                        and then let him build up from the bottom. It would not tax his ingenuity
                        probably to build a poultry house a little better that he had seen. (hear,
                        hear, and laughter) And after that he would take a second step in
                        architecture. My second problem was a stable, a small one. (laughter) That
                        was fortunate. It was the right process. I did not have to borrow anything
                        to start with, and I started with necessities alone. The total investment
                        was 60 dollars in the first building and 300 dollars in the second. If you
                        divide those figures by five you will know what they represent in your
                        money. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>Convention is not a proper basis for art. Art is not something that is put on
                        to buildings or on to canvas or anywhere applied but it is the doing of some
                        necessary thing in the best way that can be devised to do that thing; and
                        erecting a building in concrete, for instance, will mean the investigating
                        of the possibilities of construction, of surface treatment, of economical
                        handling, of scale, of color, of form, rhythm, and proportion that can be
                        brought to</p>

                    <p>apply on the material for the particular purpose it has to serve. I said I
                        was glad that the schools in the United States had been so closely allied
                        with the Engineering Schools, and I think therein will be their salvation;
                        not that engineering will dominate, but that it will be just the other way
                        when its essential relationship to architecture has been understood.</p>
                    <p>The jerry builder, I take it, is a natural product of architecture as it is
                        taught. (laughter &amp; applause) In the first place the architect does
                        not stoop to solve the problem of the jerry builder's attempts to get the
                        maximum result for the least money, but when the architect does get really
                        down to that bedrock principle he is able to drive out the jerry builder. I
                        have had some experience in putting enough time into the study of a £400
                        working man's cottage to make it cheaper than the jerry builder could make
                        it, and get more results for the same money, and that sort of thing has led
                        to a repetition of that particular design. Then I found that combining house
                        units and working them out in what appeared to me to be the most economic
                        way the largest problems could be solved, with results no jerry builder ever
                        thought of, in the correlating of groups for convenience and effectiveness
                            <note>N-YHS substitutes "attractiveness"</note> around the garden cities
                        of England, where an effort to compete has been made, the jerry builder's
                        sale sign does not bring its result. The people are going into these
                        communities that have been carefully, economically and scientifically
                        planned, and are leaving the jerry builder high and dry.</p>
                    <p>Architecture, as it has been taught, is based on convention, and is thus a
                        cult which the man on the street is not initiated into, and while we suggest
                        the glory that was Greece, or the splendor that was Rome, he knows nothing
                        of what we are driving at, and consequently becomes disinterested in the
                        whole subject and indifferent. It is a remarkable fact that savage people
                        build well and beautifully.</p>

                    <p>We cannot find a sample of savage building or even or animals erecting such
                        monstrosities as some of our structures. They have no architectural cult.
                        Architecture is so real and necessary a thing in primitive lives that the
                        average man takes an interest in it, which accounts for the beauty of a
                        Polynesian village as compared <note>"with" inserted in N-YHS</note> the
                        Colonial Settlement alongside. Everywhere that primitive man has constructed
                        he has done so with the idea or beauty of architecture, hand in hand with
                        the idea of construction, proving to me that there is an intuitive quality
                        in the human mind, that the human mind has the faculty of judging rhythm, of
                        rhyme, of these beauties that are poetical; that it demands those things in
                        its work, but when it is diverted in its appreciation of architecture, to
                        things which are irrelevant, it becomes confused, and finally it abandons
                        the whole thing to the architect or takes what it can get without the
                        architect, because it does not understand what the architect is trying to
                        give it. The architect is trying to teach <note>reach?</note> too much.
                        Ferguson <note>James Fergusson?</note> said that architecture died in the
                        year 1500, and I think that the corroborative evidence is very strong.
                        Before that time architecture to count had to be homogeneous. If we are
                        going to have architecture count for anything in a city we shall need to
                        have a common basis running through all buildings. Where the architect is
                        permitted, as he is by his cult, to take his authority from wherever he
                        pleases, he is bound to disagree with his colleagues as to which precedent
                        to adopt, and will put his Gothic design alongside the other's Classic
                        building, and we have not seen a place where we have been able to prevent
                        that. So whatever beauty one has got into his own building is nullified by
                        the contrasting beauty of an adjoining one. No wonder "the man in the
                        street" is "up in the air." He gets no effect. He sees 2 buildings, and we
                        cannot get him into the habit of looking at one facade at a time. He is very
                        apt also to look at the back end of the building. Another hypothesis taken,
                        which is</p>

                    <p>not borne out by the facts of the case, is that architecture is confined to
                        the one side. (laughter)</p>
                    <p>The question of genius, it seems to me, answers itself when we go back to the
                        year 1500, and see architecture as it was practiced without cult or without
                        self-consciousness, and where the average is high there genius does not
                        appear, and does not have to appear. Perhaps the word genius is simply an
                        expression of low average. (laughter) The basis of our study, I think, is
                        Nature itself. If we can go into Nature that has been undefiled by man we
                        can get beauty equal to that of any primitive architecture, or we have the
                        architecture of the plants and of the animals, where nature's laws are
                        allowed to work themselves out. These laws are inviolate in the emphasis of
                        structural necessity, and taking advantage of natural conditions, and
                        expressing those conditions with the maximum possibility. The law of the
                        survival of the fittest dictates that. (hear, hear)</p>

                    <p>The Japanese type with the overhanging eaves brought low to form the window
                        heads is about the only thing we see in <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright's
                        work except where he saw say some European architect doing something quite
                        different in which case he jumped in with some such form in order to claim
                        it as coming from himself. But such work as Le Corbusier's is properly
                        speaking not architecture at all. It is engineering, bare bones, and though
                        it may meet the physical needs of men does not solve the spiritual problem
                        at all. It lacks the spirit of mathematics, the spirit of music.</p>
                    <p>The overhanging roof takes two forms, the hip and the gable. Which is used
                        depends on the fenestration. It cannot be reduced to a rule of thumb. If the
                        plan in developing results in corner piers grace can be most easily attained
                        by using a gable roof whereas with windows grouped in the corners the hip
                        can be used without forcing an extreme overhanging which is really a refusal
                        to recognize natural structural laws, in a sense an uncalled for defiance of
                        the noble laws of gravity. When the roof recedes to form the wall line it is
                        in essence a flat roof though the method of the disposal of the water
                        requires slopes which may sometimes be visible as a hip. With the very
                        simple forms often imposed by a small flat roofed house they are often much
                        more effective, powerful, in reality than can appear in a picture rendering,
                        as in the case with the Egyptian pyramids. In the reality they are
                        breathtaking if the spirit of mathematics is there.</p>
                    <p>When a true creative work has been done it is a permanent thing. It consists
                        in bringing into form harmonious with cosmic laws the other etheric
                        formative forces. From that time on this creation is accessible to all human
                        beings, in the material world if they are limited to observation by their
                        physical senses but in the etheric world if they can function
                        inspirationally. It is a curious thing how unfruitful Wright's work has been
                        apparently because of the poison of his spirit of personality and</p>
                    <pb n="216"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 216 ====]</p>
                    <p>possession which kills the spiritual things. This is a great pity but the
                        influence of <note>Louis H.</note> Sullivan and Griffin has spread far and
                        wide and now that the Wright incubus has been shed modern architecture,
                        creative architecture, is taking root. It is long overdue. The men of this
                        period should be thinking creatively, spiritually, though creative work is
                        always in the nature of sacrifice. It is the giving of oneself and to be
                        wholesome must be wholehearted, not niggardly. And the world should not be
                        buffaloed by claims to spiritual works, they are the gift of the Gods not
                        the work of men.</p>
                    <p>The difference in the two attitudes is expressed in the difference of the
                        constitution of the two offices. Griffin's office from the very start was
                        completely democratic, that is based on equity with no hang-over of European
                        imperialism. The draftsmen were always free to do their own work in their
                        own time in or out of the office knowing it would arouse no objectional
                        feeling but would get helpful advice if they wanted it. When a draftsman
                        developed a clientele of his own he could enter into a democratic
                        partnership with the office so that he did not have to cease earning a
                        salary and face the risks of the early stages of establishing a private
                        practice. Later he was under no compulsion if he wanted to separate from
                        that partnership. The resulting standard of the outgoing or instaying young
                        architects was remarkable. One who went out was Mr. Taylor who sat in the
                        offices in America of Hollywood designing sets which have had great
                        influence in the architecture. One who stayed in was Mr. <note>Eric
                        M.</note> Nicholls who in his early days did some remarkable things, one a
                        multi parallelepipedon pyramidal design for a war memorial, and who is now
                        carrying on a fine practice in Australia based on the no compromise with
                        one's principles, which was true of the whole of Griffin's lifetime
                        practice.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>With several clients' finding their houses more charming, with no waste
                        space, built at a less cost and a charm almost never seen in a minimum cost
                        house, with cupboards and book-cases stopped at the 2nd story window sill
                        level to form massive piers in the lst story and flower boxes in the 2nd
                        story, several of Griffin's clients planned to go into the building
                        business.</p>
                    <p>In these earliest houses Griffin proved to the electricians as well as the
                        owners that indirect lighting was no more expensive and far pleasanter than
                        direct, the first client having both systems installed.</p>
                    <p>From that time he used nothing else. Unfortunately his early departure for
                        Australia brought that great improvement almost to an end for a quarter of a
                        century.</p>

                    <p>THE INTERIOR COVE LIGHTING FOR RESIDENCES</p>
                    <p>This living room is 13 feet by 23 feet with an 8 foot 6 inch ceiling. The top
                        of the cove is placed 17 inches below the ceiling. There is a total wattage
                        consumption of 200 watts, or .67 watt per square foot. This furnishes the
                        entire illumination for the room, with an easy reading intensity of light.
                        The piano portable lamp is for use when it is not desired to illuminate the
                        entire room, but simply to read the sheet music.</p>
                    <p>In the illumination of the home, the architect and illuminating engineer
                        comes closer in contact with his client than in any other branch of his
                        work. He is given a chance to work up many original and decorative ideas
                        embodying special features which will harmonize with the general decorative
                        scheme of the various rooms.</p>
                    <p>Until recently, practically no attention was paid to the lighting of these
                        rooms when drawing up the specifications. This matter was left to the owner,
                        who generally seemed to hold the opinion that the room which is best lighted
                        is most lighted. As a result, a great many of our otherwise beautiful homes
                        are glaring examples of inefficient lighting, which are not even comfortable
                        to sit in.</p>
                    <p>Corrected practice dictates that some way be devised to conceal the bare lamp
                        from view. It is also believed that well diffused illumination very largely
                        minimizes the effect of glare and deep shadows making for a soft, efficient
                        light.</p>

                    <p>TWO SOURCES OF WEALTH<lb/> LAND &amp; ABILITIES</p>
                    <p>Two things create wealth, not work for the values created by work belong not
                        to this economic period but to the preceding period of barter; but <hi
                            rend="ul">land</hi>, natural resources, and play. Play is what we do for
                        the sheer joy of doing it, the fascination of using our abilities.</p>
                    <p>These two, natural resources and human ability, create values and are the
                        source of wealth - land plus spirit.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that land is a gift of the Gods and the fairies and can belong
                        to no man though each and all have equal right to use it so long as they do
                        not injure nor destroy it. The fairies build the vegetable kingdom but it
                        takes the great primal spirits of mathematics to create the crystals - the
                        universes.</p>
                    <p>To whom do we owe our abilities? Certainly not to our descendants. Nor to our
                        ancestors, but to our own development in past incarnations. The direct
                        attack of labor on land suffices for mere existence. It gives us certain
                        primal commodities for exchange, but not wealth. But with the introduction
                        of spirit, of creative ability, we get capital which can be accumulated; we
                        get technique which brings about division of labor which enormously
                        increases wealth and we get diversified <hi rend="ul">means of
                        production</hi> which are the expression of <hi rend="ul">ability</hi>, of
                        spirit, in the economic realm.</p>
                    <p>To whom do these means of production which are the result of ability, of
                        play, belong? To our ancestors we might say. But how can this be put into
                        actual practice, how can we pay this debt?</p>
                    <p>We owe our abilities to our ancestors through inheritance or to the Gods who
                        give these gifts or to our own endeavors in past incarnations for no man
                        during his lifetime originates abilities, he can only develop them. We
                        experience the truth of this in waking out of sleep with a full-fledged
                        invention or a problem solved. At one time he plays one game and again
                        another. But each one knows those</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 223a ====]</p>
                    <p>particular abilities were there from the beginning, and no two human beings
                        are alike.</p>
                    <p>We owe our opportunities to develop our abilities to the educational systems
                        established by our predecessors, that is to the community which is the
                        manifested result of the conduct of life of those who have lived before us.
                        We owe to this community the inspiration that comes from all the creative
                        work they have done in the development of their capacities, in the arts, in
                        science, in religion, that is their manifested life on earth. We owe to the
                        community all we have the opportunity to make use of in the form of tools,
                        of industrial plants, of accumulated inventions, of inspirational
                        undertakings, of means of circling the earth and of choosing our place and
                        mode of life.</p>
                    <p>We owe none of these things to our descendants who gave us nothing, but to
                        the community which is the creation of our ancestors we owe whatever we may
                        have achieved in the way of means of production as our small contribution to
                        their accumulated gifts to us because means of production are the

                        commodities, etc., we have a right to place in the hands of our descendants
                        as an expression of affection if we wish but means of production belong to
                        the community whose duty it is to place them in competent hands so that
                        their management can make them most fruitful.</p>
                    <p>When we recognize this basic fact we shall find the community eager to place
                        in our hands all means necessary to develop ability to the utmost and it
                        will not lay down what line of ability shall be used by any man nor measure
                        his value by the monetary returns that derive from his abilities. Whatever
                        he achieves whether spiritual satisfaction or great wealth will be his so
                        long as he lives. When he dies it will belong to the community who made it
                        possible for his abilities to function, and it will be used to give similar
                        opportunities to all members of the succeeding generation. This will make it
                        possible for the children of the rich man to develop wholesomely, which is
                        rarely the case now</p>

                        sister</note></p>
                    <p>who tells me she owes everything to me in drawing as did Louise Lightfoot in
                        dancing and Ida Prescott and Bret Hart Smith in poetry.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>1st Term.</p>
                    <p>JUNIORS . 5 to 8 years.</p>
                    <p>In our first lesson we made with our arms the shape of the Cosmic Circle
                        which holds all things.</p>
                    <p>We then drew the shape and inside it made as many drawings as possible, the
                        sun, the moon, the stars the sea, us, etc., in color.</p>
                    <p>(The teacher had prepared large sheets of paper before-hand on which she had
                        drawn with a compass the circle, the drawings were therefore co-operative
                        ones.) Outside the circle we painted blue (water-color).</p>
                    <p>When this was finished we again made the circle shape with our arms, and
                        became acquainted with<lb/> (a) circle-like motion.<lb/> (b) Our eyes
                        contain a tiny copy of the circle.</p>
                    <p>We found the secret in the circle, the vertical line, and as this series of
                        lessons was to lead to plant drawing we found as follows.</p>
                    <p>A large piece of paper was given to each child, they creased it down the
                        middle, and painted along the crease (in a color) a vertical line.</p>
                    <p>We made this line swell and grow sideways, teacher painting one side for
                        them, children carefully painting the other side. After this the children
                        invented the first shape themselves.</p>
                    <p>We developed last lessons by making the shape grow as shown</p>
                    <p>(a) a family of shapes (similar to each other)</p>
                    <p>(b) Changing its shape as it grew.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 225 ====]</p>
                    <p>Note - Teacher also drew her shapes on board, using the underlying shapes of
                        leaves, so that children would recognize these again when at a later age
                        they found them in botany.</p>
                    <p>(c) Making the growing shape burst as it grew.</p>
                    <p>(d) Added to the original shape one of the 4 formative force shapes, using
                        first <note>sketch of a circle</note> and then <note>sketch of an
                            equilateral triangle</note>.</p>
                    <p>Children invented variations of these (e) and also broke the leaf shape
                        itself into these shapes (f) <note>sketches of a crescent and a
                        square</note></p>
                    <p>(e) (f)<lb/> They also made free growing patterns with these 4 shapes as
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>We drew these shapes <note>blank space in N-YHS</note> on the board and tried
                        completing them with <note>blank space in N-YHS</note>, and combinations of
                        these, etc.</p>
                    <p>(g)<lb/> We noticed fairies at work (g) in periods of activity and rest. We
                        tapped out the rhythm.</p>
                    <p>Lastly we invented flower shapes and fruit shapes, using the 3 formative
                        shapes -</p>
                    <p>Kenneth, one of the boys who has always shown a great interest in these and
                        last year's lessons said to me at the beginning of the holidays at the end
                        of the term, "Please give me the very biggest piece of paper you can find, I
                        want to draw the four fairy patterns all through the holidays."</p>
                    <p>He brought it back covered with the patterns mostly plant shapes.</p>

                    <p>Teacher mentioned to children on last day of term that if they kept their
                        eyes open during the holidays they would find the patterns the fairies had
                        made on the plants, etc.</p>
                    <p>Dear Marion, at present I am very busy having signed a contract with one of

                    <p>We started with the primordial triangle, the equilateral triangle, the
                        artistic triangle from which all other triangles spring. The geometric

                    <p>The equilateral triangle is capable of perfect growth and the "opposite" form
                        of growth was constructed, mention being made of crystalline expansion
                        following this procedure.</p>
                    <p>4 equi-lateral triangles were next constructed and used as the basis for a
                        perfect pattern - that is - all sides to grow similarly. Pattern colored.</p>
                    <p>Upward growth of equi-lateral triangle, whereby we obtain isosceles triangle.</p>

                        whenever possible, girls became used to hearing them and took them
                        naturally, as a matter of course.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Art is the result of free human nature, and the sense of duty ripens when the
                        human impulse to activity commands materials artistically and with inner
                        freedom. Rudolf Steiner</p>
                    <p>FEEDING THE HERONS</p>
                    <p>When asked to do a mural by the graduating class of June 1931 of the
                        Armstrong School of Chicago, the first thoughts might be of appropriateness
                        from various points of view. From the technical point the work must be
                        correct, that is it must be kept in two dimensions with no creating of
                        illusions as to there being no wall there by clever three dimensional
                        stunts. This is the best lesson in the painting realm that the artist could
                        give to the children because the art of painting has been degraded by this
                        working with three dimensions which belongs to the arts of sculpture and
                        architecture, just as music is the one dimensional art, sequence. These are
                        the universal languages of space, spirit and time. Color is not a material
                        thing. It is the mediator between spirit and matter, as is the rainbow.</p>
                    <p>This conclusion is confirmed by spiritual investigation through which we
                        learn that painting derives in pre-rational times from direct perception in
                        the etheric realms, the realm of color - two dimensional, non-substantial.
                        And our own experiences of supersensible living pictures confirm this. Such
                        experiences enable us to understand that the superb decorative work of
                        ancient civilizations derive from that different kind of thinking which is
                        now so important for us to learn to use as a supplement to reason which
                        works in only one dimension, for these same etheric forces are the ones
                        which enter into the vegetable kingdom, the life forces which distinguish it
                        from the mineral kingdom. When we have become aware of, can perceive, these
                        forces we are in a position to carry our scientific investigations on from
                        the mineral into the vegetable kingdom, the life realm, which rational
                        science, so-called natural science, cannot do. Not even <note>Charles</note>

                    <p>"By art alone is intellect awakened to true life-giving Joy in Earnestness,
                        and Strength of Character in Joy; for Knowledge to be of value, must be
                        permeated with a Love of Knowledge."</p>
                    <p>This is why it is so important for children from seven to fourteen to be
                        taught only from the imaginative point of view - through the Arts.
                        Imaginative work does not bring fatigue. Science, Geography, History, should
                        all be presented in art forms. Mathematics too for geometry should precede
                        arithmetic.</p>
                    <p>Since all physical creation consists in pattern making, the mural must hold
                        and stir the mind by its pattern. The children will thus be helped to rest
                        satisfied with their own work only when they themselves have created a
                        pattern in the presentation of their subject. The result will be that
                        observers will not be satisfied with a passing glance and thereafter forget
                        to look again but that every time they pass the picture they will be caught
                        and held and moved by it, and their own creative faculties, which have
                        become almost atrophied in our concentration on mechanization during the
                        so-called scientific period will be awakened. Indeed form is the essence of
                        matter, form held by reciprocal forces. The smashing of the atom has
                        confirmed that for they find no matter in the atom - only forces.</p>
                    <p>And then the appropriate subject - the out of doors, the creatures of the
                        open and the spirits that work and rule there, these spirits despised and
                        scorned by the sophisticates of the 19th century but with which the children
                        of the 20th century must come in contact if they are to carry on the
                        evolution of humanity, something by which we can portray these fundamentals
                        to the eye and heart of the child. And what spiritual facts can convince the
                        child. Not wordy moral precepts but a personal intimacy with the elementals,
                        the tiny ones, for the children love tiny things. So the fairies that up to
                        a certain age any child can see and that we grown-ups can learn to see if we
                        will - the fairies who show the plants how to transform inert mineral
                        matter, the rocks</p>
                    <pb n="232"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 232 ====]</p>
                    <p>themselves, into living matter without which no other creature, animal nor
                        man, can exist - the fairies who help the plants to build up cell by cell
                        all the various shapes and colors to carry into effect the designs which
                        great and powerful beings have created and stored within the magic seeds.</p>
                    <p>Again we must convince the minds of the children, warped by the
                        superficialities of our present-day thinking, that they are surrounded not
                        only by a world that they can see and hear and touch with their physical
                        senses aided so wonderfully as they are these days by mechanical instruments
                        to extend their field of operations but which can never reach beyond the
                        world of effects; but that they are also surrounded by another world, the
                        world of causes just as diverse, just as rich, just as full of adventure,
                        which they can learn to perceive and in perceiving to enter, and in entering
                        to become a creator in this realm of creation, the world of life.</p>
                    <p>For the same faculty which enables one to see the fairies is the faculty
                        which enables one to do original work in all human realms, and to transform
                        our community, so rich in toys and tools, into a real civilization thereby
                        attaining great and worthwhile ends. For this, human beings must develop
                        their spiritual powers of perception, the basis of a new form of thinking
                        which will enable them to know causes as precisely and as thoroughly as at
                        present they know effects.</p>
                    <p>Painting the mural decoration in the Armstrong School was great fun. One boy
                        said to Miss Reynolds, the principal, "You sure did hire a good one when you
                        hired Mrs. Griffin. "I didn't hire her," she said, "I got down on my knees
                        to her." And this was the splendid spirit all the way through. The subject
                        was a group of fairies high in a birch tree helping the mother heron to feed
                        the babes in her nest, the father heron winging his way from a distance
                        helped by other fairies to carry more supplies of fish. It was five feet
                        high and twenty feet long and I stood on a table to paint it. Miss Reynolds
                        let the youngsters get all</p>

                    <p>they could out of it and there were daily processions from the various rooms
                        to watch its progress, and free were the discussions, as with the children
                        in my sister's room <note>Georgine was a teacher at Armstrong</note>, as to
                        whether there really were fairies. One small boy asked Miss Reynolds as she
                        came in the room whether she believed in fairies. "Why of course I do," she
                        answered. One small six year old agnostic was reported to me so I took issue
                        with him. He said his father said there were no fairies. I said, "But who
                        made the flowers and the leaves of the plants?" He said "My father said God
                        did." I said, "But if your father manufactured chairs, he would have to have
                        many helpers in his factory; so God has to have many helpers with the many
                        things he creates." Two small girls were heard by the lunch-room cook
                        discussing, as they sat on the curbstone, whether there really were fairies.</p>
                    <p>The mural was finished shortly before graduation and Miss Reynolds was good
                        enough sport to let me give a talk to the graduating students in which I
                        explained to them that the kind of thinking that enabled them to see the
                        fairies was the same kind of thinking that made people able to function as
                        geniuses so, if they wanted to be among the geniuses in their work, they
                        must be ready to develop that kind of thinking which someday would enable
                        them to see the fairies.</p>
                    <p>THE WEAVING OF FAIRY AND SPIDER</p>
                    <p>After this visit home with my family in Chicago I returned to Castlecrag to
                        find that one of our young citizens had lost her new baby daughter within a
                        few weeks of her birth. She came to me soon saying she could find no
                        consolation and hoped I could give her some help. She found no comfort in
                        her church. She had heard our Mrs. <note>Edith</note> Williams speak of
                        Anthroposophy but Mrs. Williams was no longer there. We had been in a German
                        class together so I suggested that we carry on our German study by
                        translating together Dr. <note>Rudolf</note> Steiner's lecture on prayer,
                        which we did. I had found much delight in her two older children and we
                        often had discussed Annette's baby reports of the fairies she saw</p>
                    <pb n="235"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 235 ====]</p>
                    <p>now and then as they took their excursions over the bluffs, along the
                        foreshores, in the caves, among the ever-blossoming shrubs and trees.
                        Frequently Annette would stop, calling the attention of her parents,
                        exclaiming, "Oh look at that little fellow," pointing him out with excited
                        interest. Mrs. Trinick had told me these things because I knew there were
                        fairies and had told her of the nature of their work in building up plant
                        life - the gnomes in breaking down the rocks for the penetration of the
                        tender roots; the undines the chemists who built up stem and leaves; the
                        sylphs forming and painting the flowers; the fire-fairies building fruit and
                        seed.</p>
                    <p>A MOON CHILD - ANNETTE</p>
                    <p>The child Annette was a beautiful thing, looking indeed like a child of the
                        Moon. Later on when she had lost this faculty, as most children do now when
                        they pass their third year, she still remembered, doubtless because her
                        parents had been sympathetic and receptive, and so sometimes she asked why
                        she didn't see the fairies any more. We told her that in these days people
                        as they grew older had to learn to see the fairies. In discussions that
                        arose with other children when her school days began, she quite overmatched
                        an occasional small rationalist who contemptuously said there were no
                        fairies by answering flat that there were fairies - she had seen them. This
                        usually ended the argument for what one has seen one knows and her
                        conviction based on experience was convincing.</p>
                    <p>One day instead of her coming up to read with me, I went down the hill to see
                        Mrs. Trinick. As I approached I saw someone going into her house, a
                        tradesman, so I stopped before going on till he was gone. As I stood on the
                        hillside scattered over with yellow hawksbill blossoms I thought what a
                        lovely thing it would be if I myself could see a fairy, of how the reporting
                        of such an experience to her who was such a lover of children would help her
                        to realize the reality of the spiritual world and of spiritual beings.</p>

                    <p>So I did a little concentration exercise on the plants and presently of a
                        sudden the whole hillside blossomed out with lovely brilliant blue little
                        beings moving about, dashing here and there between the plants - millions of
                        them like living blue flames almost filling the space all over the hillside
                        between the flowers. It was a lovely and wonderful sight. It was the undines
                        I saw at their work. When I checked on this later with others who had seen
                        them they confirmed in detail what I had seen. I was happy to be able to
                        report this to Mrs. Trinick and felt that they had shown themselves to me
                        because they too wanted to comfort a loving and grieving mother. At other
                        times I have seen the fire-fairies, the salamanders, who like little golden
                        comets dash about condensing the light to feed and form the fruit. I have
                        never seen the other fairies though there are, among my friends, those who
                        have.</p>
                    <p>The mothers on Castlecrag divided up the week in taking charge of the small
                        children, one specializing on pottery, one dancing, one on botanical jaunts
                        and so on. In my Saturday morning art lessons, if lessons they could be
                        called, with babies up to their sixth year, we gave free reign to our
                        fantasy to which knowledge lent wings. The qualities of numbers figured
                        large in our plays and the children thrilled to it, fresh as they had come
                        from the great Spirits of Mathematics. Wholeness we swung and drew and
                        painted, the red circle of the primal warmth condition of our universe. And
                        in our great circles we dotted sun and stars and earth and moon. We went
                        straight from that to trinity which they adored. It was an endless source of
                        games and pictures and discoveries, this threeness which is true unity. For
                        years they brought me new trinities, never once three indiscriminate things,
                        always a true trinity, and with such rapture - clover leaf or a newly
                        discovered flower, the butterfly's wing and drawings of angel's wings, and
                        fairies' wings. And what excitement there was in the Guy family when the
                        calla lily opened and was no sooner open than Bronwen discovered the

                    <p>of the tip of the pistil. Truly a surprise the fairies had given her and the
                        news went round.</p>
                    <p>From threeness to fiveness where we stand now. Spread their feet and stretch
                        their arms and we have and draw it just so in its simplest form, and we have
                        there in our own bodies the story of where we came from - the stars. "When I
                        first put my feet on the Earth," said young David and atheistic parents
                        sometimes objected to the positive statements the youngsters made at times
                        about angels and spiritual beings.</p>
                    <p>Nor could they understand why the babes couldn't be drawn away from their, to
                        the adult mind, incomprehensible paintings but I knew and the babes knew
                        they were getting real information - about life - for which they are so
                        eager. That's how the planets are formed, I told Glyn
                        <note>Nicholls?</note>, a five year old who had been building up
                        intersecting circles within a big circle. "Is that how it's done," he said.
                        And you could see the satisfaction he took in his creative work. And this
                        five-year-old spent the whole afternoon working out some dozen designs,
                        really interesting, in circles of various sizes. Later we had twoness, the
                        oval and the crescent moon, and dad's eyes stuck out when his four year old
                        daughter told him you couldn't have an up without a down, nor an inside
                        without an outside, nor the visible without the invisible, nor matter
                        without spirit. He felt his own materialism breaking down under the assured
                        statements of his baby girl. They learned that all animals' bodies and man's
                        own are a twoness that came when their divine origins were compressed from
                        the circle to the oval, and with swinging movements we drew on the
                        black-board fish and birds, horses and tigers, and with the wave - the
                        crescent moon, the origin of twoness, the dragon, the hissing snake and swan
                        and so on.</p>
                    <p>After the Guys had moved onto their farm and mother and Bronwen were making
                        me a visit, mother telling me that daughter was winning praise in school for
                        dancing and drawing both a part of Castlecrag life. Bronwen said, "You
                        taught me how to draw bodies." She was quite</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 241 ====]</p>
                    <p>conscious of the advantage of basic knowledge.</p>
                    <p>I called the attention of a two year old to the seed pods on a tree and they
                        were a constant fascination for her for years to come. "Why the apple is a
                        seed-pod," she told her mother. And the fairy lore of the bush, the scribbly
                        gum, the Eucalyptus Haemastoma, where the fairies wrote their messages. Such
                        fun!</p>
                    <p>And how they loved secrets. The secret in the heart of the triangle which we
                        discovered by folding the equilateral triangle in two three times to form a
                        pyramid and painting the forms within the hexagon with alternate blue and
                        red - a sixness - that lovely floral form. "The secret in the mother's
                        heart," I said. "A boy and a girl," said Kaaren <note>Deans?</note>, and
                        then with their equilaterals they built the hexagon, that bond between the
                        physical and the spiritual (for you can't make a solid from hexagons) with
                        which one can do so many lovely things - the pattern on the turtle's back,
                        endless flowers, new stars and suns in combination with the trinity itself.
                        And the dragons on the blackboard appeared again with father and child,
                        father and child swinging as a great dragon down the hillside - the
                        children's idea not the fathers'.</p>

                    <p>We can see that liquid does not really belong to the mineral kingdom; water
                        for instance when it solidifies expands. We can see this in the forms its
                        crystals take, the frost on the window pane, foretelling the vegetable
                        kingdom.</p>
                    <p>the tree form follows the form of light movement, triangular. We find early
                        form in Australia. The fern with spores has become a tree there. They came
                        up from the South pole. The Auracaria too so formal in its growth, the
                        precursor of the pines. The water lily foretells the cactus.</p>
                    <p>The vegetable kingdom transforms spirit to matter, mathematics to life. The
                        ethers shape the leaves, from circular to triangular. Australia's Archangel
                        was the greatest of artists playing with forms. Griffin emulated him in
                        playing with forms. We find lovely painting in the coloring of the barks
                        vivid in the Angophora Costale.</p>
                    <p>Which requires the greatest intelligence the building of a bridge or the
                        building of a tree?</p>
                    <p>Plants do not consume food, they create it. Science knows only the mineral
                        kingdom. Before life it confesses itself ignorant.</p>
                    <p>Spirits conceived life into the triangle and the sphere. Goethe sensed this.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="ul">LIBERTY &amp; EQUITY</hi> Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>The issue between Liberty and Equity is stressed as the Crux of out time by
                        Dean <note>Teachers College Columbia University</note> William F. Russell's
                        "So Conceived and So Dedicated" in the May Atlantic, also by Albert J. Nook
                        and Newton D. Baker in earlier issues. These writers site diverse early
                        authorities but not the late Dr. Rudolf Steiner who succeeded, through
                        extending the sources of data beyond obvious physical laws, in showing that
                        although these conditions are mutually exclusive, it does not follow that we
                        must choose the one and do without the other, nor compromise by subtracting
                        one from another to obtain the insignificant remnant of opposing forces; for
                        each has a clear field in which it is a paramount necessity.</p>
                    <p>There need be no greater conflict between Liberty, Equality and Fraternity in
                        the genus humanity than there is between then as willing, feeling and
                        thinking in the species individual man himself. The difficulty arises out of
                        incapacity to recognize authority except as a unity whereas it can be
                        conceived of as a trinity. The human being is of spirit, soul and body and
                        his threeness is a wholeness, made up of distinct elements: - the
                        assimilative system exemplified by the stomach, the regulatory system by the
                        heart and the nervous system by the head.</p>
                    <p>Where one of these systems interferes with the operation of the other,
                        disease ensues. But just so are our states trying to carry on.</p>
                    <p>The intuitive cry of the French Revolution recognized the threefold needs of
                        the social body, but not how to meet them. We can enjoy social health only
                        as we learn how. A society whose institutions are based on its threefold
                        nature will be able to function properly like a human being, each one of
                        whose three systems traverse the whole body: - <hi rend="ul">Liberty</hi>
                        the function of an individualistic creative and productive cultural
                        activity,</p>

                            >Political</hi> organization, <hi rend="ul">Fraternity</hi> the function

                    <p>We can enjoy each principle to the full in the realm to which it belongs and
                        has its value where each may supplement the other two just as do our free
                        voluntary metabolic and limb activities, the moral impulse of our feeling
                        and the logical laws of our thinking.</p>
                    <p>Toleration toward the idea of a single world economy and codes worked out by
                        various industries under the National Recovery Act <note>National Industrial
                            Recovery Act of 1933</note> began to illustrate the inevitable trend
                        toward segregation of authorities according to functions and the
                        relinquishment by the States, to competently constituted institutions, of
                        all powers not strictly implicit in formulating and maintaining standards of
                        human rights according to the degrees of moral consciousness obtaining in
                        the respective communities.</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN BOURGEOISIE ALL INCLUSIVE</p>
                    <p>When I was leaving Chicago to start my course in architecture at Boston Tech
                            <note>later the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</note> my beloved
                        companion, Aunt Myra <note>Perkins</note>, recognizing my sanguine
                        temperament advised me not to take all the courses the university offered;
                        but on my return home I found my own home was offering the same temptations.
                        My French Club pal, Katherine, always said she never thought of Mother's
                        dwelling as a home but rather as a community. Mother herself, principal of
                        the Komensky School, in addition to being the whole support of the family of
                        five children from the time the youngest was four, was really the precursor
                        of such developments as university extension giving art courses to her
                        teachers during the years and decades, attended by many teachers from other
                        schools and repeated in her home for the neighborhood on Saturdays, and
                        undertaking to make livable quarters out of the barracks that our schools
                        are (How could they be otherwise under the control of a political
                        organization) which in her case she transformed into a real art gallery
                        through loans made by friends usually becoming permanent, stained glass
                        windows, etc. So that you never went through its halls without seeing
                        children gazing here and there at some work of art, for here one found a
                        statue and there the colored glow from a window or a whole story on the
                        stairway wall of <note>Louis-Maurice</note> Boutet de Monvel's Jean d'Arc
                        and such, and a very fine collection of European posters brought from
                        various vacation trips.</p>
                    <p>One incident in connection with the Saturday Art class might throw some light
                        on Mother's family. One afternoon I was practicing on the piano when my
                        brother Gerald came home. We nick-named him the "smiling telegraph pole"
                        though his normal expression was serious as that of a judge. Not liking the
                        sounds I was making, he ordered me to leave the piano. Naturally I didn't
                        obey his instructions so he lifted me off the stool and put me on the other
                        side of the room. Naturally again I immediately returned to the piano and
                        after a second attempt</p>
                    <pb n="250"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 250 ====]</p>
                    <p>to settle me elsewhere returned and without looking at me caught me by the
                        braids hanging down my back and hauled me unceremoniously across the room to
                        the front door. On opening this to put me out he became aware of a shy
                        stranger coming to mother's class and simply with a lift of his hand put me
                        into an erect position and left me to deal with the situation. With my quite
                        natural sweetness I greeted her and invited her to come in assuring her that
                        Mother would be home at any moment, but she managed to find some excuse and
                        disappeared never to return.</p>
                    <p>The home program was always a full one so it was usually impossible to change
                        the day of the week for any function since every day was packed. In the
                        daytime everyone left for a day's work but the spare time was filled full.
                        There was not only the art class on Saturday afternoon and a general round
                        up of friends of my sister, who was the belle of the neighborhood, on Sunday
                        afternoons to stay for bread and coffee and on into the evening with songs
                        and nonsense till Mother's alarm clock went off as a hint to the young folks
                        that it was time to go home, which hint was as a rule not taken seriously.
                        Monday would be filled with the rehearsals of the dramatic club which after
                        a few years of presenting not too ambitious plays settled down to the study
                        under Mr. Blake, and the presentation, for he insisted we never would give
                        proper finish to a work without presenting it, of Shakespeare's plays which
                        we carried on for the rest of the 15 years of our existence, some of our
                        members graduating to the professional stage. I took part in this as I did
                        in all the functions, the rest of the children being more choosey. So I had
                        the fun of being Portia and Beatrice and Olivia and Cordelia and so on
                        through the years.</p>
                    <p>Another evening would be given over to the little orchestral group, for Aunt
                        Myra was a pianist who filled another evening too with a study group for
                        listeners-in to the Saturday evening <note>Theodore</note> Thomas concerts.
                        And another evening a group gathered for the study of poetry, Mr. Blake
                        reading it, himself a master of English verse and a writer of plays.</p>

                    <p>One of the interesting things he did was a series of experiments in
                        versification based on plotted mathematical curves. He would take the same
                        motif and put it into some normal metric form and then put it into the
                        geometrical form and, without telling which was which, have us express our
                        preference. It was surprising how frequently we chose this new experiment.
                        He and I had many a pleasant quatre d'heure in comparing our arts, mine
                        being architecture. When either of us found a basic principle we passed it
                        on to the other to find how it applied there. It was a great lesson to find
                        how these discoveries could be applied to advantage in either art, in all
                        the arts. All children should be brought up to express themselves in all the
                        universal languages - the arts. It is no harder to learn them all than to
                        learn one. The arts are play and they play into each other. They are lonely
                        without the companionship of their fellows. Our ridiculous idea of experts
                        these days is a deadly thing. Of course in the realm of time we may spend
                        most of our time in one or another.</p>
                    <p>The oldest of the children was Jerome. The kernel of antagonism between him
                        and myself may have started when Mrs. <note>Ella Flagg</note> Young, who was
                        a bit of a tease, on one of her visits to Hubbard Woods flung an arithmetic
                        problem at Jerome which he could not answer, quite likely because of a bit
                        of stage fright, and she turned to me, listening in from across the room and
                        said, "Well Marion can answer that," which I promptly did. One might say
                        that Jerome was the immoral member of the family and perhaps I myself was
                        the prude for our conflicts in later years were largely of such a nature.
                        Jerome was brilliant and widely informed and I remember a New York friend
                        dropping a line to Mother saying she wondered if Mother knew what a cultured
                        gentleman her son was. I myself no matter how great the row had been could
                        never resist, when Jerome came home from work, the temptation to slip down
                        and sit on the stairs, when I was too angry to go near him, to listen to his
                        sparkling account of the day for no matter how stodgy the office he</p>
                    <pb n="253"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 253 ====]</p>
                    <p>was in, or whether he was without a job, the day had some picturesque
                        adventure as seen through his eyes.</p>
                    <p>He was one of those Americans whose work, if the United States had been
                        democratic instead of imperialistic in those days, would have gone a long
                        way in this last half century toward establishing friendly relations and
                        economic unity in the Americas. Our imperialism means that we are still
                        under the domination of Rome, under the Spirit of Addition, interested only
                        to get and get and never give whereas by now, with all the advantages
                        America has had, we should be well under the influence of the Spirit of
                        Subtraction, the impulse to give and give and never get. Really Jerome's
                        impulse and abilities and trend in Mexico were of a colonizing nature. He
                        and his wife were of those who would have aroused friendly feelings instead
                        of enmity.</p>
                    <p>Instead of the Americans' helping, President <note>Woodrow</note> Wilson,
                        awakened one night by some official urgency authorized (to his later regret)
                        the sending of soldiers down to Vera Cruz. These American soldiers captured
                        some scores of Mexicans, lined them up the next morning and shot them.
                        Naturally this aroused feeling throughout Mexico and Jerome was one of those
                        who were taken to prison. The personal feeling of those with whom he had
                        been working and living was illustrated by one Mexican's pleading with the
                        soldiers to take him instead, that Senor Mahony was a good man. But they
                        threw him into prison and every day for about a week they brought him out,
                        stood him against the wall to be shot and then sent him back to his cell,
                        and finally released him. A strain to the nerves indeed but one could not
                        blame the Mexicans but only deeply appreciate their having finally released
                        him. The blame was of course America's.</p>
                    <p>One can see that if the economic organization had not been mixed up with the
                        political the work of such a man would have been of common advantage to both
                        Americans and Mexicans, for the nature of economics if it is not supported
                        by monopolistic powers granted by the states</p>

                    <p>in that liaison of our present system, is fraternal, the very continuance of
                        economic relations depending upon mutual advantage to both parties. The
                        economic stream could not continue to flow if there were not advantage to
                        both buyer and seller. It is time we quit bandying words and took action for
                        the establishing of democracy by freeing the political organization from its
                        unwholesome alliances such as economics and education.</p>
                    <p>The mere fact of universal suffrage does not bring about democracy. Nor is it
                        possible with the complications which we pile on our political organization
                        to get anything in the nature of an intelligent expression from the people.
                        Jerome remarked one day on the frequent statement that women didn't have
                        enough brains to vote, saying that he went in once and looked up and down a
                        long complicated list on the voting paper given to him and gave up trying to
                        find what to do and never again went to a voting booth, his conclusion being
                        that neither did men have enough intelligence to vote if intelligence was
                        the thing called for. I myself have gone through life the same way. I went
                        to vote once and realizing afterward what a foolish thing I had done never
                        went back again till after I was 70 years of age.</p>
                    <p>Jerome was married when he was quite young and went with his wife to spend
                        five years in Europe. They systemized their journey and spent about a year
                        in each country during which Jerome concentrated on getting hold of the
                        history of the country. When he returned he took an examination to teach in
                        the evening school. He failed in the history examination. Naturally his
                        answers were not the text book answers. He tried to get a job in Chicago,
                        but the firms he went to wouldn't take him on because he was out of the
                        country five years during which his life was not recorded by the official
                        records. Nothing he could say or anyone else could say for him as to
                        character and occupation during those years could make any difference. They
                        simply wouldn't employ him. He started a factory in Minneapolis
                            <note>Minnesota</note> which he carried on for several years</p>
                    <pb n="256"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 256 ====]</p>
                    <p>and got a thorough understanding of how life can be more difficult for the
                        employer than for the employee. After having sunk considerable funds he gave
                        it up and started out with a quarter of a dollar in his pocket and beat his
                        way across to Montana. He "rode the rods <note>rails?</note>" under the
                            <note>railroad</note> cars and earned his way picking up odd jobs here
                        and there when he could. More than once he went for more than seven days
                        without food. He said that after the second day you don't mind it. One of
                        the most trying situations he ever had to face was when a companion he was
                        on good terms with suggested a partnership and explained the nature of his
                        business which was stealing, and showed him his apparatus to safeguard
                        himself in case of emergency. That, Jerome insisted, took more tact than any
                        other situation he ever had to face since he really had to convince the man
                        that he was one of his own kind and that there was no danger of Jerome's
                        giving him away.</p>
                    <p>Arriving in Montana, he got a job as cow-boy on a ranch and later established
                        himself on a ranch of his own. One of his heart breaks was the upsetting of
                        the boat in the turbulent river in going to this new ranch and not being
                        able to recover his violin which for so many years had been his boon
                        companion. Circumstances brought him back to Chicago some years later and
                        his next adventure took him down into Mexico.</p>
                    <p>In our childhood there was really almost a sixth member of our family for our
                        only first cousin Dwight <note>Perkins</note>, a few years older than
                        Jerome, was with us much of the time. It was in his office that I had my
                        first architectural experience. Many years later he remarked that it seemed
                        odd to him that he had never known me, the most Bohemian person he had ever
                        come in contact with, to be guilty of any impropriety. In his mind there
                        seemed to be something irreconcilable about this. In my business
                        partnerships I had at times traveled with my partner. Questioning the
                        propriety had never entered anyone's head. It was one of the natural things
                        that have succeeded in establishing wholesome relations between man and
                        woman in America.</p>

                    <p>The adventuresome nature of the typical American was expressed in one of the
                        events of the Hubbard Woods summer vacations. The two younger boys, Gerald
                        and Leslie fourteen and ten years of age, packed a lunch early one morning
                        and went off to the lake. They had made up their minds to build a raft. With
                        this constructed before the morning was over they ate their bit of lunch and
                        started to paddle around on their raft. It was not long before they were
                        caught in one of those occasional currents of Lake Michigan and, paddle as
                        they would, they couldn't get back to shore. They passed one pleasure boat
                        the voices from which they could distinctly hear and called out to them for
                        help but no one paid any attention to them. Naturally, we felt afterwards
                        that anyone seeing small boys so far out should have brought them in even
                        without their asking for help.</p>
                    <p>Toward evening Mother went down to the shore but not finding the boys assumed
                        they were somewhere around in the woods. However as the twilight deepened
                        into darkness she became very anxious and the neighbors gradually gathered
                        to spend the night out in the storm which had arisen, searching the woods
                        having at times that curious experience of walking in circles. The next day
                        the word went far and wide. Friends came out from the city, among them Mrs.
                        Young <note>Ella Flagg Young?</note>. I remember that when it had occurred
                        to her that the boys might have been picked up by some boat going into
                        Chicago, I went up with her to run ahead to hold the train about due so that
                        no time should be lost in following up this possible clue. I set her a pace
                        indeed and when I tackled the conductor telling him he must hold the train
                        which he said he couldn't do, my breathlessness helped my commanding will
                        and he waited until Mrs. Young, scarcely able to breath, climbed onto the
                        train. She went to John R. Walsh who proceeded to get in touch with the
                        various boats for it was the 4th of July and no boats were coming in or
                        going out.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon was drawing to a close when the men told me to persuade Mother
                        to leave the Lake shore so they could drag the Lake.</p>
                    <pb n="259"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 259 ====]</p>
                    <p>We had of course been telegraphing far and wide and as Mother mounted the
                        steps of the station platform a telegram came through saying the boys were
                        found.</p>
                    <p>When Jerome had gone down to the Lake there was a bit of a board raft on the
                        sand which he had kicked contemptuously aside saying the boys would never
                        have tried to go out on a thing like that. In fact they had worked well on
                        the raft they had made having nailed four logs securely and this bit of a
                        sieve had weathered the storm all through the night, the storm which the
                        boat captains said no small craft could possibly live through. It was so
                        dark that Gerald had to keep reaching out his hand to feel if Leslie was
                        still there. A huge vessel almost ran them down but their screams of terror
                        were not heard and the ship went on its way. In the morning they were so far
                        out they could not see any land so had to wait till the sun rose to know
                        which way to paddle. They had hung onto their paddles so as dawn came, in
                        spite of their exhaustion, they paddled in finally reaching the shore. They
                        started to walk but when they spoke to a man he wouldn't believe them when
                        they said they had come from Hubbard Woods twelve miles away and went on his
                        way leaving them to get along as best they could.</p>
                    <p>They would walk for a while then sleep for a while. They passed through a
                        picnic group and asked for something to eat but nobody paid any attention to
                        them. They went on and Leslie who seems to have an inborn genius for finding
                        money found a penny and they went into a shop and bought the biggest thing
                        they could buy for a penny. It took them nine hours to make the first six
                        miles, half the way home when, as they were passing a railroad station, the
                        agent spoke to them to see if by chance they were the missing boys. They
                        were packed on the next train for home. So frightfully sunburned were they
                        that a touch was agony and that first night Leslie ran a bit of a
                        temperature. But two days later a friend came out from town to see the boys
                        and couldn't believe his ears when Mother greeted him telling him the boys
                        were not in, they had gone down to the lake.</p>

                        way through college - the Armour Institute <note>of Technology,
                        Chicago</note>. He belonged to those fortunate days before high finance,
                        when banking business was run on some such lines as would be universal if
                        there were an Abilities Organization. So he was able to get financing on
                        purely personal credit, no security, to run a factory. Later he spent some
                        years in the making of transformers in one of the towns on the St. Joe
                            <note>St. Joseph</note> river. Getting homesick he bargained with his
                        domestic sister, Georgine, to keep house for him if he bought a home. Some
                        time passed and she had begun a course of training as a nurse when a
                        telegram came up, "If I buy a house will you come down." She couldn't very
                        well drop her work off hand so I feeling ready for a holiday from drafting
                        telegraphed - "Gene can't but I will if you'll have a piano as well."</p>
                    <p>Everybody was filled with consternation when they found Gerald was to be in
                        the hands of a professional woman instead of his sister Georgine. They were
                        sure he would starve to death. That was in the early days of women in the
                        professions when such ideas were prevalent. I suggested to Gerald that of
                        course he couldn't expect to be provided with a dinner when genius was
                        burning, but he was ready to accept any proposition I made for he had gotten
                        his eye on an old, left over farm house which the town had grown up to and
                        around and which was right on the bank of the St. Joe river, and the bank of
                        the Elkhart river just across the street in front. The friend with whom he
                        had been boarding suggested a carpenter he ought to consult to get advice
                        about fixing up the house. He replied that his sister was an architect and
                        would do that, to which she replied, "Oh but she won't know about Elkhart
                            <note>Indiana</note> ways." Sometimes perhaps he thought he would have
                        been less exploited in the carpenter's hands for he always insisted that I
                        ruined him. But such fun as we both had! A big brick fire place in the
                        living room with odds and ends of architectural modeled plaster work built
                        into it. Before the scaffolding was out, though it was a hot day, we crept
                        in under to build a fire and sat there hugging our</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>While the Monroe Building in Chicago was under construction Griffin found no
                        use was being made of the attic space. Always a space saver Griffin took
                        this space for his office.</p>
                    <p>This later became quite a custom in down town buildings. A seed planted
                        grows. He and a number of the young Chicago School of Architecture had
                        already made similar use of the attic space in Steinway Hall building of
                        Dwight Perkins. A considerable number of the young Chicago School moved in

                        Griffin, <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright, Bowrie <note>Adamo Boari?</note>,
                            <note>Myron?</note> Hunt, etc. Wright whose early work was without
                        distinction was only just out of Sullivan's office and only now was
                        following the Japanese emphasis on the horizontal <note>"Japanese inspired
                            horizontal" in N-YHS</note> line which had considerable influence on the
                        whole group.</p>
                    <p>Griffin was already planning a city for a Chinese client who unfortunately
                        died before the work could be initiated. This was Griffin's first plan of a
                        whole Municipality.</p>
                    <note>Griffin drew up plans for an addition to the port of Shanghai for Wong Kai
                        Kah (1860-1906). The drawings were lost when Mr. Wong died while returning
                        to China.</note>

                    <p>A second story over the one story kitchen made a grand billiard room, and
                        over another ell made a sumptuous studio room; and the huge old fashioned
                        barn picked up, moved over and dropped down over the riverbank formed a
                        boathouse below with the whole huge hayloft above converted into a screened
                        pavilion open on three sides, with commanding views up and down the river.
                        It served for community life in Elkhart somewhat on the lines of Mother's
                        home though tending more to water delights than land-lubbers' interests.</p>
                    <p>I found the children bathing in this dangerous river with those wicked little
                        water wings and taught them all how to swim. Here I had a chance to teach
                        all my married friends how not to keep house, but really to live. Here in
                        the hay-loft Rachel and I rehearsed and painted the scenery - Florence as
                        seen from the heights of San Miniato, and disgusted Gerald by ripping off
                        the side steps of the house to aid our imaginations in the balcony scene of
                        Alfred de Musset's play which had been presented in Paris by Sarah Bernhardt
                        and Agar <note>Leonide Charvin Agar?</note>. I did the strolling minstrel
                        and learned how to thrum the guitar for this special occasion. Mr. Blake had
                        translated it for us into beautiful American verse. Later on we transported
                        the scenery to present the play in Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Great fun we had for nearly three years and then Gerald had to go down to the
                        Tierra Caliente of Mexico to erect a sugar mill and to carry on with the
                        management for some years. This again is an instance of years wasted for
                        lack of an Economic Organization for this splendid business on an ideal
                        location came to an end and is utterly wasted because of the totalitarian
                        states. The Elkhart house was closed for a while but afterwards for many
                        years served as the ancestral homestead for the family for vacations and a
                        place to which we could fly with the children for country air. My niece,
                        Clarmyra, whom I took down there when she was three years old, when we
                        returned from our first afternoon prowl, sat down on the step and announced
                        - "My nebber going in the</p>

                    <p>house again," and that became the rule for the year or two I spent there with
                        her, her Mother coming down for the weekends. For the tradesmen and the
                        other familiars never tried the house doors first but always came around to
                        the river bank fairly sure to find us there. Later, after his marriage, this
                        treasured place became Gerald's home again and still is.</p>
                    <p>However, before this return he had given this homestead to Mother. Now one of
                        mother's favorite pastimes was reading the wills in the papers and she
                        always got herself insured when traveling and every time made a new will
                        having great fun apportioning this manufactured inheritance. She wrote me
                        she had willed one of her houses to Georgine and the Elkhart one to me. At
                        this time we were trying desperately in Australia to unify the Castlecrag
                        estates for which end the Haven estate was very important, so I wrote her
                        that since she wasn't using the house I would greatly appreciate it if she
                        would sell it and send me the money instead of willing it to me. Learning of
                        this Gerald's wife's father bought back the house <note>"Gerald bought back
                            the house (which he had given her)" in N-YHS</note> from her and the
                        total price was sent over to me. - These Irish - This made a tremendous
                        difference in our carrying on this undertaking and proved a source of income
                        which met all sorts of needs. Gerald having bought the place twice over was
                        again able to occupy it himself.</p>
                    <p>Jerome again went down to Mexico and spent the rest of his life there,
                        Gerald's plantation being near the Gulf and Jerome's near the Pacific Ocean.
                        Gerald too was one of the outside plantation managers who would never carry
                        a gun though there were 700 men on the plantation, half Mexican and half
                        Chinese. The boys had at that time made the journey from Puerto Mexico to
                        Salina Cruz, bathing in the two waters on the same day. Here is where the
                        Panama canal should have been for the crossing is practically at sea level
                        for the whole distance. Had there been a world Economic Organization there
                        would have been no barriers for such a rational arrangement.</p>
                    <note>At this point in the New-York Historical Society copy appear two pages
                        (numbered 265b and 265c) which contain a letter from Jerome Mahony to his
                        mother. In The Art Institute of Chicago copy the letter does not appear
                        here, but in the next chapter, No. 12., on pages 273a and 273b.</note>

                    <p>We talk of opportunities being over but that is nonsense. We simply have to
                        wipe out, by setting the example ourselves, the imperialism which comes from
                        state ownership of nature and capital, the consequences of which have come
                        to their inevitable conclusion in Europe, which catastrophe there is no way
                        of escaping except by eliminating the cause in ourselves - the totalitarian
                        form of community organization, substituting three organs for Security,
                        Economics and Social Requirements.</p>
                    <p>I got one of my thrills while in Australia on reading an article in the
                        Freeman <note>periodical title</note>. Though no name was used I found
                        myself reading about this brother Jerome of mine. The writer had found
                        himself in this remote and isolated region - in Tehuantepec - waiting for
                        hours at a little railroad station and was so excited to have encountered
                        here "one of the most interesting men" he had ever met that he made an
                        article of it and here I was on the other side of the world making
                        connection with my family anew. The world is not so big. It won't be
                        difficult to make a unit of it so long as we don't expect different groups
                        to have the same moral standards, nor individuality to be eliminated. Let's
                        wipe out the "Prince of the World" idea and realize that it is nonsense to
                        think of any of the European communities as democracies.</p>
                    <p>My sister Georgine was obliged to give up her undertaking of being a nurse
                        because of a heart difficulty which perhaps had resulted as the outcome of
                        acute attacks of rheumatism through her childhood. Doctors pronounced it a
                        leaking valve and incurable saying she probably could not live through her
                        teens and it would not be possible for her to live to the age of thirty,
                        that she must be very quiet putting no strain on her heart. Her response was
                        to dance and run and climb, for in those romantic years death had no terror
                        but rather a romantic appeal. She did however go on a unique diet which may
                        have caused Mother some anxiety in those days which feared the foods we now
                        consider</p>
                    <pb n="267"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 267 ====]</p>
                    <p>most important. One might say cucumbers were the chief of her diet. Anyway it
                        was what would now be called an eliminator diet, and she would have nothing
                        to do with the meals set before the family. I am inclined to attribute to
                        this as well as to her spirit the fact that all the signs of her physical
                        disability disappeared and when in her fifties these doctors saw her, they
                        asked to be permitted to listen to her heart and found that the leak had
                        disappeared. However she went into teaching instead of nursing and like her
                        Mother before and her daughter after her, was a genius in this realm. Her
                        experience in nursing was of value to herself and her friends. She was one
                        of those who functioned and was looked upon as an angel by those who came
                        into her environment though, as Mother said, in her girlhood she could make
                        the Angel Gabriel angry if she wanted to.</p>
                    <p>Leslie was the babe of the family and didn't have a fair start because with
                        Father's death he was put into school at four years of age so that, since
                        this was before kindergarten days, he got the intellectual work so
                        destructive to the body if prematurely used. These etheric life forces up to
                        the sixth year of age are required for building up and establishing the
                        physical body. If they are diverted, before the change of teeth, to head
                        work which is their natural field from that time on, they leave the physical
                        body depleted for the rest of one's life. So Leslie was too thin and short
                        of vital forces all his life but so far as success, as generally understood,
                        is concerned he was the one who attained it. As a youngster he had taken
                        great satisfaction in the fact that he, as he said, had "friends among the
                        rich and the poor." That faculty served him well and as manager of the sales
                        Department of Explosives he broke the record of the du Pont Company in spite
                        of the fact that depression came during his term of office.</p>
                    <p>Of Mother a family friend, Anna Ickes, said she was the only person she knew
                        who held the center of her stage to the day of her death which came when she
                        was eighty-five years of age. She had retained her</p>
                    <pb n="268"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 268 ====]</p>
                    <p>position as principal until she was seventy six still full of vigor and able
                        to do physically what none of her teachers could do - go from the top of one
                        of her four story buildings down to the first floor and up to the fourth
                        floor of the other building and address a class without stopping to catch
                        her breath. She resigned against the wish of her teachers about half of whom
                        were so disgusted with the principal who succeeded her <note>"a man"
                            inserted in N-YHS</note> that they left the school to go to other
                        districts.</p>
                    <p>There is a requirement in Chicago that the principal and superintendents mark
                        the teachers. A new superintendent learning that Mother always marked all
                        her teachers 100 in everything said that was insubordination, a defiance of
                        the system. Gossip brought this to Mother's ears and she tossed her head
                        saying he was welcome to visit her school any time he chose. When he did
                        come she let him go from room to room making his own choice. By the time he
                        had visited three he could keep quiet no longer but said he had never heard
                        such work in his life. All the school work was on exceptionally high
                        standards but as it happened he was a singing superintendent and Mother's
                        school was in the Bohemian district, the children when they entered not
                        being able to speak English, her teachers were mostly Bohemians and
                        consequently they and the children were practically all musicians. With part
                        singing of lovely music it was no wonder that he was astonished. Mother
                        never heard any more complaints about her marks of her teachers.</p>
                    <p>In our youth a charcoal drawing of my Aunt Myra's hung on the wall, a
                        life-sized head which I always thought was a portrait of Mother. Not till I
                        was grown up did I learn that it was Beatrice Cenci. I was interested years
                        later in a confirmation of this resemblance. An Italian draftsman in the
                        office once came to me a bit mysteriously and asked if I knew Beatrice
                        Cenci. I said, "Yes." He said, "You like her?" I said, "Yes, I think she was
                        very beautiful." "You have the same outline," he said, "You have the same
                        outline." I had been prepared not to give too much weight to that remark by
                        another friend who had said that he and I</p>
                    <note>"Beatrice Cenci" was a Renaissance noblewomen executed with other family
                        members for murdering her abusive father. Her story has been the subject of
                        works in literature, music, and the visual arts.</note>

                    <p>were designed by a genius but one who was sadly lacking in a classic
                        education. And indeed by another friend who had said to me very earnestly,
                        "You are like my wife, you know you are a very plain looking woman." So
                        there you are. What wonderful things friends are.</p>
                    <p>So as we settled into our work, Mother's family was scattered from Chicago to
                        Wilmington, Delaware, to Mexico, to Australia and India. Now I am convinced
                        that in this second half of the 20th century the stream of immigration to
                        the United States should flow on and Americans should emigrate to all parts
                        of the world teaching the things that have been ingrained in their blood
                        through the two centuries of the experience of democracy and should spread
                        the knowledge of it throughout the world for elsewhere democracy is
                    unknown.</p>

                    <p>This may spur the hope that this song may be sung again three decades from
                        now at the second centennial. Let us hope the fulfillment of our task may

                    <p>America has been populated by the adventurers of the world. One might say
                        that America had been reserved by the Gods to perform great tasks for the
                        coming millenniums. Her first real adventure was in the 18th Century in the
                        political field, establishing Equity as the foundation of Political
                        Government. Her adventure in the 19th Century was in the Economic Field
                        culminating in the present decades and now being carried to the world -
                        Mutuality.</p>
                    <p>Her present task - of the 20th Century - is Liberty, and calls for the
                        emigration of Americans to all parts of the world. The meaning of the word
                        is practically unknown elsewhere. To build this arch requires the two
                        foundation stones of Equity and Mutuality - i.e., democracy in the Political
                        Realm and fraternity in the Economic realm. It calls for the development of
                        every individual's ability throughout the world. It is the opposite of
                        imperialism and is well expressed in Mr. <note>President Harry S.</note>
                        Truman's great speech in Berlin of 20 July 1945 - where he spoke of "a
                        better world, a peaceful world, a world in which all people will have the
                        opportunity to enjoy the good things of life - and not just a few at the
                        top." He said, "Let us not forget that we are fighting for peace and for the
                        welfare of mankind. We are not fighting for conquest. There is not one piece
                        of territory nor one thing of a monetary nature that we want out of this
                        war. We want peace and prosperity for the world as a whole. We want to see
                        the time come when we can do the things in peace that we have been able to
                        do in war. If we can put this tremendous machine of ours, which has made
                        victory possible, to work for peace, we can look forward to the greatest age
                        in the history of mankind. That is what we propose to do."</p>

                    <p>Jerome's letter from Oaxaca gives a glimpse. Killed in a motor car accident,
                        but his wife carried on and still does.</p>
                    <p>Dearest Mother, There is a matter of $77 due from me to daddy some time in
                        August. If the matter is in any way brought to your attention I hasten to
                        explain that I have arranged to remit those funds from here. (Which he did.
                        MMG) If the present deal goes clear over I shall be relieved in many
                        directions. I will have a splendid start for further operations and would be
                        really quite well off if I stopped and simply farmed the finca
                        <note>estate</note>.</p>
                    <p>For a long time the people here thought I was a tramp, then they began to be
                        afraid I was not, then they thought I was a bluffer, now they have for a
                        moment, definitely made up their minds that I am a millionaire. This carries
                        with it the punishment that is meted to millionaires and reputed
                        millionaires generally.</p>
                    <p>The next property I will take over will be on the sea, in front of the Las
                        Conchas ranch I am taking over now. Of course I do not know how far I can go
                        and one's difficulties increase as the operations get further extended. So
                        for the present I shall simply do all I can on the ones I have started on
                        and commence turning the land into cash a little later on. <note>the phrase
                            "and commence . . . later on" crossed out in N-YHS</note> The
                        headquarters here I will always keep and also one finca of 5000 or 10000
                        acres. So I now have, if there is no slip, and always will have, a big
                        "estate" really here and you can step from the train to within a few feet of
                        headquarters and drive out to the finca.</p>
                    <p>From the Conchas you can see the spot where Cortez built his ships, the
                        ancient town of San Francisco is as quaint as a corner in Spain. Many of the
                        roads are along the sea and made of the shells and consequently look like
                        Boulevards. There is not probably an estate in England which has as many
                        deer on it as has our Las Conchas and there are but few places in the world
                        where such enormous quantities of fish can be hauled out with a net. I am
                        putting the houses, fences, etc., in order and one of the servants will be
                        the "hunter" who brings in fresh</p>
                    <pb n="273b"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 273b ====]</p>
                    <p>fish every morning and venison whenever required, a deer a day if it could be
                        eaten, for a salary of $4 a month. You can get <hi rend="ul">all</hi> the
                        fish and meat you can get away with for yourself and a gang of men for $4 a
                        month. The place is a grove of palms and over the most of it one can ride at
                        a gallop. No underbrush.</p>
                    <p>I expect to plant thousands of cocoanut trees a few at a time and have in
                        time some thousands of cattle. Living generally here is cheap. One can live
                        like a king here if he wants to for very little. I want you to come here
                        soon. Mexico has much of the charm of Europe. This valley is old, old, old.
                        Its roads, its churches, its costumes are ancient. For my part I love it. It
                        is a veritable sleepy hollow.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>When after a sufficiently long period of patience, Xanthippe put the
                        suggestion before him that he would have to find his woman sometime, that he
                        couldn't expect his mother and sisters <note>to</note> take care of him
                        forever - both Xanthippe <note>Marion Mahony Griffin</note> and Socrates
                            <note>Walter Burley Griffin</note> were in their thirties - he agreed
                        that was quite true but that though he quite recognized the spiritual and
                        intellectual bond between themselves, he didn't feel the need of her. He
                        always did pride himself on what he called honesty. You see he had had his
                        first love affair with a beautiful and charming young woman <note>Frank
                            Lloyd Wright's sister, Maginel?</note> and in the face of the two
                        alternatives between which men customarily choose after such an experience,
                        he did not hurry into affairs with other women but set aside the idea of
                        woman.</p>
                    <p>She had been on holidays from her professional work for some time and was
                        keeping house for her brother in the perfectly good substitute for an
                        ancestral homestead on the banks of the beautiful St. Joe
                        <note>Joseph</note> River and had invited Socrates down for week-end camping
                        trips on this magic stream, so had learned his weakness. He had been brought
                        up in an inland suburb, had longed for the water but been forbidden by
                        timorous parents to go on or in the same when he went off with the boys
                        bent, as they suspected, on reaching some distant pool. Of course he
                        disobeyed them. What a blessing for humanity that children are not
                        overburdened with too great respect for the opinions of their elders.</p>
                    <p>Xanthippe, who was practicing architecture in partnership with one of the
                        other members <note>Herman von Holst?</note> of the school of independent
                        design in Chicago, in the same building as the office of Socrates, with the
                        wisdom of the serpent, suggested one day that they buy together a canoe and
                        explore some of the nearby streams. Little did she know what she was in for
                        as a consequence of that innocent remark. Like the ancestors of her own
                        family Socrates was, in every domain of life, an adventurer and thrilled
                        with the idea of pioneering. She had simply been aware of the fact that men
                        are dependent creatures and felt that if Socrates got used to being</p>
                    <note>"Xanthippe" was the wife of Socrates. Her name has become an eponym for a
                        shrewish, scolding wife.</note>

                    <p>with her the need of her would grow in him. But he immediately saw worlds to
                        discover and conquer and then and there their doom was sealed. She watched
                        him in amazement as she did for the rest of their lives. He hadn't in the
                        least made up his mind to marry her (though she had and that perhaps made a
                        difference) but that was of no importance and could not for a moment be
                        allowed to stand in the way of the undertaking for undertaking it was - to
                        rediscover domains in the same pristine state of loveliness as in centuries
                        gone by when <note>Rene-Robert Cavelier</note> La Salle and
                        <note>Jacques</note> Marquette journeyed through the Mississippi Valley.</p>
                    <p>And nothing but the untoward thing that happened a few years later which took
                        him to the other side of the world, as will develop in this tale of
                        adventure, kept him from taking these discoveries and constructing from them
                        a most lovely thing to bring into the consciousness of his community to
                        develop and to add to the glories of his native city - a community plan for
                        Chicago and its environs, i.e., the state of Illinois <note>1913 City Club
                            of Chicago competition?</note>. The lovely thing lies there still
                        unrecognized and unused awaiting the return of his magic breath.</p>
                    <p>Xanthippe's business arrangement with her architectural partner was that she
                        should have complete control of design. Thus it was recognized that creative
                        work can spring from one mind only who must have full authority and final
                        decision in all matters of design and construction. The arrangement worked
                        very well but was not the complete and logical one that was later developed
                        in the office of Socrates. For indeed it would usually be necessary for the
                        designer to have the contact with the client to be able to mold his mind in
                        the give and take so necessary in the solution of a problem where the client
                        always wants more than he wants to pay for.</p>
                    <p>The half dozen or more under her in the drafting room worked well and
                        enthusiastically, for here was one of the few places where the ice was being
                        broken for the freeing of the profession from the apron strings of stylistic
                        architecture, a movement so wonderfully started and established by Louis
                        Sullivan, and which received such a deadly set-back in</p>

                    <p>the very heart of the movement in the Chicago Columbian Exposition, the whole
                        nation being seduced by the superficial beauty of that wanton thing.</p>
                    <p>Her natural bent was toward independence and the girlhood motto - to live as
                        always to be able to respect herself - had been the cause of her failing in
                        design in her <note>Boston</note> Tech course due to her repugnance toward
                        the required custom of going to the libraries for designs. The ultimate
                        leniency of the beloved head of the department, Mr. Chamberlain, due to the
                        fact she did well in her other work, and possibly that she was a woman,
                        recognizing the difficulty of suppressing revolution in a woman and the only
                        one in the course at the time, were probably at the bottom of her not
                        failing to get her degree, though the presentation of her thesis won the
                        praise of the head of design, M. Depradelle <note>Desire Despradelle
                            (1862-1912)</note>, whose joy had been exceeding great over a caricature
                        of her by an under-class man depicting her, back view with a halo around her
                        head, with toes turned widely out (a habit which it took years for Socrates
                        to correct to make her walk straight footed like any proper Indian of the
                        forest and right he was for with her black hair straight down, a band around
                        her head, she would be taken for an Indian anywhere) walking straight toward
                        the temple of fame in the distance while the street on both sides was lined
                        with brass bands bowing and blowing their heads off. "Yes, yes," said
                        Monsieur, "Yes, yes to the temple of fame."</p>
                    <p>In the drafting room was Mr. McArthur who has since been doing fine creative
                        work in the Western States, who complained that she was very strict when she
                        jumped on him for altering the design - the story height, of a house while
                        working on the drawings, without referring the matter to her. But she
                        impressed it on him that a design cannot be worked to two ideas, and to
                        attempt it was the unforgivable offence. Mr. <note>Roy</note> Lippincott
                        too, who years after, won the competition for the main building of the
                        Auckland University, built it and established his profession in New Zealand,

                    <p>she was drawing so as to get in first on the educational side of the work,
                        designing, detailing and rendering. Later he followed her to Socrates'
                        office and to the Antipodes (married to Socrates' sister) whence he branched
                        off to his own practice.</p>
                    <p>And unforgettable was the expression on the face of the engineer, the third
                        member of the firm, when he saw an instance of her method in the office,
                        when she leaped at a draftsman and said, "Oh, you naughty little thing. You
                        have done that wrong," where he would have cursed and fumed. But her method
                        was effective where his would probably have failed except on the surface.
                        For all the draftsmen young and old were most painstaking and untiring in
                        their work. In fact many times she told the younger ones not to work too
                        hard, that the important thing was to keep themselves alive and wide awake.
                        Many years later she learned in very truth how this is the essential
                        requirement in entering the whole realm of spiritual realities, to become in
                        fact an independent and creative being, to enter the supersensible with
                        fully alive and wide awake self-consciousness instead of trying to penetrate
                        it by trance or medium or blindly not knowing what one is doing nor how. By
                        these fully conscious methods the doors to genius are open to every human
                        being.</p>
                    <p>A strenuous week and Saturday noon arrived and two wicked little runaways
                        dropped their canoe into the Chicago River at the Van Buren street bridge.
                        The canoe was taken by their loving hands and launched at the point nearest
                        to the station where it arrived from the East and then and there its journey
                        began which was to last in weekly installments through the succeeding years,
                        never retracing its steps, till the misfortune of fame called them to far
                        distant parts. Allana they named the beautiful creature - Allana - Beloved -
                        and she was left high and dry on the shores of Lake Michigan where their
                        last week-end adventure had ended before they started out to conquer
                        single-handed the most powerful and menacing empire of the present day.
                        Socrates had provided two canvas sleeping bags with blankets. Xanthippe had
                        provided bread and bacon and</p>
                    <pb n="279"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 279 ====]</p>
                    <p>frying-pan and pail.</p>
                    <p>They were both of them working to the limit of their strength in their
                        architectural work and could spare no time outside of the usual Saturday
                        afternoon and Sunday. Xanthippe had expected to start on Sunday because that
                        would give them a whole day for the outing. But waste a half a day when
                        Allana was there on the water and waiting! Such a thought was intolerable to
                        the logical mind of Socrates and we must remember logic started in humanity
                        with Socrates. How could so frail a thing as Xanthippe - and she was frail -
                        stop the most powerful force that had yet come to human beings in the long,
                        long course of their development. Not yet was she aware of the still more
                        powerful force that is developing in this new century. Well she couldn't and
                        so through their lives logic won in the battle royal between Socrates and
                        Xanthippe even to the taking of the hemlock.</p>
                    <p>Where in the world but Chicago could such an undertaking have been carried
                        out, at the southern end of Lake Michigan with radiating streams from the
                        surrounding districts pouring their waters into it, and such a system of
                        radiating and belt lines of railroad as is to be found nowhere else. For
                        they were hard working young people and had to be at their tasks all through
                        the week. And entering a totally different world it was when they left the
                        grime and noise of the big city and dropped into the sights and silences of
                        the ages. For the canoe is not like the auto which keeps one to the haunts
                        and sights of man and his works. The infinite wisdom of the Creator makes it
                        necessary for farmers to leave strips of forest along the river banks or
                        their land gets worn away and acres may be lost. So many times they paddled
                        for days with no consciousness of mankind. What a blessed relief! Only
                        Socrates and Xanthippe. Of course she came to seem a part of the wonders of
                        creation to him. And of course all other humans were simply humans.</p>
                    <p>Up the Chicago River they paddled (not primeval beauty there) and even with
                        the Hades of the modern city about them, though at times their</p>
                    <pb n="280"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 280 ====]</p>
                    <p>eyes were rested by the majestic architecture of grouped silos, they began to
                        meditate on other universes to be entered and as they slipped past the
                        suburban limits and as the darkness of night and a brewing storm gathered,
                        each in his own mind with no word spoken determined that nothing should turn
                        them from this escape from the grime of our modern civilization into
                        endlessly varied paradise - except that other conquest in creative
                        architecture to which their souls were dedicated.</p>
                    <p>Finally Socrates, with that command of geography which was his by instinct
                        and industry, said they would rest on their oars for, as he knew but she did
                        not, they were at the spot where the Des Plains River in a sweeping bend
                        comes a very close to the Chicago River. So after a most uncomfortable night
                        (they were still amateurs in this realm) with unceasing rain the two,
                        ill-prepared, inexperienced and soft, portaged across to the Des Plains,
                        turning their canoe up stream.</p>
                    <p>Let no one think a canoe is light and easy to handle, anyway for white folks.
                        But in their ignorance Xanthippe took her end to carry - the prow - and not
                        till weeks later and after numerous portages was it discovered that that was
                        the heavy end as it would be of course to make it right for one in the stern
                        when alone to be able to paddle without lifting the prow too high out of the
                        water. With bones so small that her mother used to try to prevent her from
                        lifting even a tea-kettle from the stove with a - "But your poor little
                        wrists" - it certainly was some task, these portages and carries, which an
                        indifference to the use of these streams for pleasure made so frequently
                        necessary, a stretch of shallows, a ruthless dam, a barb-wire fence thrown
                        across by some self-centered farmer to keep his cows from wandering around
                        the end. On one such occasion Xanthippe's world famed peculiar talent
                        manifested itself when a typical picture-book Yankee came rushing down to
                        the further bank and threatening them for, as he supposed, cutting his fence
                        which they were taking great pains not to injure. So Xanthippe rose in her
                        wrath and drowned him out with equally picturesque diatribe</p>
                    <pb n="281"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 281 ====]</p>
                    <p>to the effect that putting his fence across the river was against the law and
                        since he was so sassy about it they would take much pleasure in giving him
                        the experience of the pinch of the law. The old man stood silent and with
                        jaw dropped till they disappeared up stream. Probably he had not had any
                        experience with truly Greek eloquence certainly not being the kind of a man
                        that a Xanthippe would bother with.</p>
                    <p>As Sunday drew to a close and train had to be caught back to the city
                        Socrates, in passing through a small town, chose a house on the river bank
                        and asked if the canoe could be left there till the following week-end.
                        Thereupon began their universal (with one exception) experience with the
                        sweetness of human nature, for throughout the three years of this adventure
                        whomsoever they asked whether farmer or summer-house occupant or bridge
                        tender, whether in poor or comfortable circumstances, no one ever refused to
                        take Allana in and care for her and sometimes it meant real trouble. Once a
                        storm arose and the rising waters started her off on a jaunt of her own, but
                        she was brought back. Sometimes as the cold season approached, they would
                        say they expected to be back the next week-end and then the winter ice would
                        close the stream and she would stay till Spring. And there after months they
                        would find her. And no one would ever accept any compensation for this
                        service. The one refusal was from an Institution well fitted to give her
                        shelter - the Naval Quarters on the shore of Lake Michigan. They were sent
                        from subordinate to higher up and so on to still higher ups and refused and
                        they, on the lake where a canoe is not really safe even under the best
                        circumstances, were sent out into the blackness of the night. They have been
                        pacifists ever since. Militarism breeds beasts not humans. No one else was
                        ever inhuman to Allana.</p>
                    <p>Back to the office and the drafting board; and pleasant work Xanthippe was
                        doing in partnership with Mr. Von Holst - residence for Mrs. <note>David

                        capturing her imagination. So one day, after they had got a cart to carry
                        Allana over to the head waters of the Fox River and had dropped her into the
                        waters of Grass Lake just when the great creamy yellow Egyptian lotus
                        flowers were in bloom and stretching as far as the eye could reach
                        (Socrates' Daemon would always land him at such a spot at the very right
                        moment) they slipped along, so soft, so still, through the huge lotus leaves
                        without even a sound (so close were the pads) of the drip from the paddles
                        to frighten the birds away. And so near they let them come! Only three

                        people of the remote past from where? Perhaps from Atlantis from whence the
                        Egyptians also might have taken them. So this landscape architect told her,
                        who knew the flora of his country from a to zed as they say in the
                        antipodes.</p>
                    <p>Afterward they got into the roaring rapids of the lower reaches where
                        Xanthippe in the prow had hung in the air over a three foot drop shouting
                        back, "We can't go here! We can't go here!" only to hear from the stern -
                        "We've got to." And after waking very early in the cold morning to slip on
                        down toward the Illinois, they watched veil after veil of the mists rise
                        from the bluffed and forested banks, each veil as it rose revealing a new
                        and ever more beautiful universe. Indeed the way to God, the Father God, is
                        through a close and intimate contact with nature. What hope is there for our
                        city-bred people. What does <note>Rudolf</note> Steiner say, not a
                            <note>"silly" crossed out</note> guess like <note>Albert</note>
                        Einstein's with his talk about a cylindrical universe, but that there are as
                        many universes as there are crystalline forms. A crystalline form is a
                        primal work of a deity - a Primal force which cannot but express itself in a
                        universe of consequences. And so after a rest on a sunny bank while he took
                        a dip in the refreshing stream, Xanthippe said, "Why don't I join you in
                        your office?" for Xanthippe was well known for her renderings, her
                        presentation work, and the work of Socrates was lying hidden away known only
                        to the immediate clients. Said he - "I never</p>

                    <p>dreamed that you would do that." Said she, "All right I'll arrange it." And
                        so they drew a bit closer together.</p>
                    <p>Xanthippe had watched with interest the transformation of the work in the
                        office where she had worked before, when Socrates, the Town Planner, had
                        gone into partnership with Frank <note>Lloyd</note> Wright, beginning to
                        realize what has become clear beyond question as time has gone on, that
                        architecture cannot be practiced properly unless based on the foundation of
                        Town Planning. Just as Town Planning without Architecture becomes nothing
                        but real estate business squeezing the life out of the earth, so
                        architecture when not combined with Town Planning in the same individual
                        cannot solve the problems of architecture.</p>
                    <p>And now on coming into his office she had revelation after revelation, thrill
                        after thrill. Problems which she had seen struggled over in office after
                        office and never solved were being solved one after another. Inspiration,
                        the source of information, had been tapped and she watched Socrates as
                        Xanthippe always watches Socrates with awe and amazement and understanding.
                        Perhaps the fools would understand Mrs. Abraham Lincoln better if they had
                        the wit to realize that true love is not based on friendly feelings but on
                        feelings "more closely related to enmity." It is time we got rid of this
                        sloppy stuff about marriage.</p>
                    <p>The small house, the minimum, the inexpensive house the most difficult of all
                        architectural problems, were solved with the precision of a mathematical
                        problem and with the exquisiteness of a Greek temple, and one after another
                        laid before her delighted eyes. So they put their heads together and schemed
                        a method of presentation. Uniform size, 18 by 36 inches on colored satin
                        with the careful outline work of an etching and finished in transparent
                        water-colors mixed with glue and a complete exposition of the building -
                        plan, perspective, section, decorative details, worked together into a
                        unified mural panel. Whenever the pressure of current work gave a moment's
                        breathing spell these were continued till later there was a good sized roll
                        for Socrates to</p>

                        the Tuileries, and so they have been in constant use from that time to this.</p>
                    <p>A democratic form of partnership was entered into which made each equally
                        independent and responsible, the separation of personal clients with profits
                        proportionate, to make the responsibility for design an individual matter,
                        proved to be a splendid basis of future partnerships with the young people
                        growing in the office which gave them a fine incentive for open,
                        enthusiastic and thorough work and a possibility of working into responsible
                        positions or into independent practice that does not exist in the usual
                        architectural office.</p>
                    <p>And then into the midst of this busy life was thrown the bomb which has made
                        these full and busy times seem like leisure days - the announcement which
                        Socrates had been on the watch for during the ten years since the Federation
                        of the Australian States - an international competition for the Capital City
                        - and Socrates applied for and received the information and the data for it.</p>
                    <p>Weeks passed and months passed with no break in the usual tenure of their
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Week-ends took them from the Fox to the "Fair Illinois" as Xanthippe's father
                            <note>Jeremiah Mahony</note> had called it in his poem "The Marriage of
                        Michigan to the Fair Illinois," dedicating the opening of the first canal;
                        but the powerful stream began to add an element of awe and dread to the
                        occupants of the frail shell so, after sweeping past the precipices of
                        Starved Rock the old Indian natural fortress, with the current, for it would
                        have been impossible to paddle against it, Socrates turned Allana's nose
                        into the Illinois-Michigan canal and they began that strange tour back to
                        the lake through regions some of which had doubtless not been seen by man
                        for 50 years or more. The new canal, the old canal, swamps. They thought at
                        one time they would have to rig up some sort of wheel support - so often had
                        the old canal disappeared as nature resumed her sway - to get</p>

                    <p>from one stretch of water to the next. All obstacles were of a nature that
                        could easily be overcome by an outer park body <note>i.e., system or
                            organization?</note> so that the whole of this three year route could
                        become a wonderful pleasure jaunting field for the immense population of
                        Chicago and all Illinois could they but have had time and strength for a
                        detailed statement of the geography and nature of these waterways. Someday
                        perhaps with young blood running swift!</p>
                    <p>At last the head waters of a stream again, the Calumet, which they followed
                        to Lake Michigan and here was where they realized the full force of the
                        phrase - "All the world is beautiful and only man is vile." For from the
                        wonder and perfection of the natural stream they passed to town after town
                        in this industrial region incredibly sordid, with the waters thick with the
                        poisonous by-products of the mills, where it would have been the easiest
                        thing in the world to have kept the river and its banks as permanent
                        playgrounds for the growing communities. Was ever any civilization so
                        stupid, so barbarous?</p>
                    <p>Then with a 45 mile paddle in one day the lake was reached. This does not
                        mean that Xanthippe paddled all that day for the canoe is an ideal toy for
                        two of unequal strength, the strong one in the stern with full control
                        whether the other paddles or not; so Xanthippe would paddle, then stretch
                        out in the bottom and snooze; then up and paddle again. But Socrates would
                        never stop. He never would at any time save by some insuperable force of
                        nature or by the force of Xanthippe. 'Twas so in the office where his great
                        ideal was to break Xanthippe of her homing habit. Always one more thing
                        could be done or a still lovelier spot for landing could be found a little
                        farther on. One night paddling up a swampy stream in flood time the moon
                        rose and the moon set but still Socrates paddled on, and wonderful it was if
                        you had the strength left sufficient for the registering of the perceptive
                        faculties. Continuous rain set in and sang songs with the drip and drip of
                        the paddle. Finally in the pitch dark they turned in to a group of trees for
                        where the bank of</p>
                    <pb n="289"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 289 ====]</p>
                    <p>the river might be no human could tell and feeling around with their hands to
                        see if there was any ground finally decided there was a bit, pulled Allana
                        up on it and went to sleep in the canoe. Socrates himself thought the land
                        would probably disappear with the rising waters and that such sound sleepers
                        would be safer in the canoe. So they spread their rubber blankets over the
                        canoe, it took the two to reach from end to end, and went to sleep.</p>
                    <p>One can easily imagine what kind of a night they spent by picturing two
                        people on a cold night sleeping in a bath tub with the plug in and the water
                        turned on, for the weight of the rain gradually depressed the blankets to
                        form a reservoir and the crack in the middle formed a perfect outlet from
                        the reservoir into the canoe. Needless to say they were on their way early
                        in the morning, slipping up the first canal to a farm house where they left
                        Allana and in their sopping wet clothes walked ten miles to the nearest
                        railway station and so home and on to the office. One learns from a
                        succession of such experiences that one doesn't catch cold from exposure.
                        This like most diseases is the consequence of living in houses. No pleasure,
                        no health, no way of educating our children, shut within prison walls as we
                        are from five years of age, or from birth, to the day of our death.</p>
                    <p><note>Rudolf</note> Steiner says that on looking back over his life one can
                        see things he has done and said that he was quite unconscious of the
                        significance of at the time but that seen from the later point of view
                        become full of significance. When Socrates was a little fellow in school,
                        and he was smaller than the average (These short men have the advantage they
                        say since as a pumping machine the heart doesn't have anything like the task
                        it has in the long fellows) he quite consciously made up his mind that when
                        the older boys teased him he would make no sign, on the theory that if he
                        didn't cry they would find no fun in it; and so it was. They soon left him
                        alone. Fine discipline for the punishments he was to receive in his fight
                        against the inertia of his time, especially in bureaucratic</p>

                    <p>controlled communities, but what a handicap it gave Xanthippe.</p>
                    <p>Such evidence of preparation in former lives for the work he was to do in
                        this was instanced by the demand on his part when he went to the Illinois
                        university for a course in Town Planning, for no University in the world
                        would offered such a course at that time. The basic religion of Town
                        Planning requires the preservation of natural beauties, a respect for the
                        works of the creator. Its practice at present entails perpetual fight with
                        all the elements of the community. The weeks slipped by and the months
                        slipped by and nothing was done about that competition. But on with the tale
                        of Allana.</p>
                    <p>What an experience that 45 mile spurt was! Going up a bit of a stream
                        Xanthippe, eagerly absorbing all delights that were offering, for she was of
                        a sanguine temperament, ecstatic in her enjoyment of all lovely and gracious
                        things, with head bent low between her arms, pulling with all her strength
                        for they were in a current so swift that they could scarcely make progress
                        against it, called, "Oh, look at the myriads of gastropods <note>i.e.,
                            mollusks, snails</note> on the logs on the bottom." "Don't look," said
                        Socrates, "Paddle!" "But I've got to look," said Xanthippe, "They are so
                        darling." "Provoking person!" said Socrates. And those are the harshest
                        words he ever said to her. Once years after, she said, I'm like Ben Bolt's
                        Alice. I laugh with delight when you give me a smile and tremble with fear
                        at your frown." And he said, "Did I ever frown at you?" and with a still
                        amazement this provoking person said, "By Jove I don't believe you ever
                        did."</p>
                    <p>At one place where the stream had many shallows they had to get out and wade
                        to lighten the load so that Allana could slip over the surface waters. A
                        municipal gas plant, taking the privileges bureaucracies will take that
                        would not be tolerated from a private organization, had let its waste
                        material flow into the stream, a black, sticky mass and such a waste of

                    <p>later in the day they reached the lake they still left their legs bare and
                        exposed to a blistering sun. The consequences later - Oh! let them be
                        forgotten! They were now at the very southern toe of Lake Michigan but no
                        rest was to be till Socrates had reached his predetermined goal, a group of
                        camping hikers on the shore at the Dunes where late in the evening they
                        arrived.</p>
                    <p>This was the organization founded by eight or ten young seers, one of them
                        Socrates, another Xanthippe's only first cousin, Dwight Perkins, which
                        interested rapidly increasing number to take long and ever longer hikes over
                        the region surrounding Chicago, and later over the State, always under
                        strict discipline to injure nothing and to pick not even a leaf; and under
                        informed leaders to discover and inspect and select the beauty spots and to
                        press for their resumption by Chicago or the State for permanent public play
                        spaces and beauty reserves. Thus Chicago achieved the finest outer park
                        system in the world. The work even overlapped into two states getting
                        Illinois and Indiana to join in saving the unique and lovely dunes which
                        were rapidly not only being occupied but destroyed by using the sand for
                        concrete and other structural purposes. After this was stopped it proved
                        just as easy, probably easier, for great sand suckers to get all that could
                        be wanted from the bottom of the lake.</p>
                    <p>The next day was the hottest any of them had ever experienced, the sand as
                        hot as the top of a stove, and they all spent the whole day in the water
                        even eating their meals there, getting out just to snatch a handful of food
                        and scurrying back to eat it with only hands and heads above water.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it was the torture of those sunburned legs, perhaps it was just that
                        well known mean disposition of hers or perhaps it was those spiritual
                        advisers, of whom Xanthippe was unconscious at the time, that said to her -
                        "We can't do anything with that Socrates without some human help. Won't you
                        do something to make him get a start on that</p>
                    <pb n="294"/>

                    <p>important matter he has in mind?" or perhaps it was the suggestion of the
                        Devil himself as Socrates was later inclined to think; anyway the storm of
                        wrath broke over his head on some such lines as follows:- "For the love of
                        Mike when are you going to get started on those Capital plans? How much time
                        do you think there is left anyway? Do you realize that it takes a solid
                        month to get them over there after they have started on their way? That
                        leaves exactly 9 weeks now to turn them out in. Perhaps you can design a
                        city in two days but the drawings take time and that falls on me. Five
                        weeks! It isn't possible to do them in nine weeks. Perhaps I am the swiftest
                        draftsman in town but I can't do the impossible. What's the use of thinking
                        about a thing like this for ten years if when the time comes you don't get
                        it done in time! Mark my words and I'm not joking either, either you get
                        busy on that this very day, this very minute (with rising tones) or I'll not
                        touch a pencil to the darn things. Serve you jolly well right if I refused
                        to take it on now." (No, not jolly. Such language only came later.)</p>
                    <p>And Socrates said nothing (He was such an amiable man) but started sawing
                        wood. Oh my, Oh my, And so a new adventure was started.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>I had just entered into partnership with Griffin when Mr. <note>Joshua
                        G.</note> Melson, who with Mr. <note>James E.</note> Blythe had recently
                        bought a bit of Mason City <note>Iowa</note> property through which a river
                        flowed, came to me to design a house for him.</p>
                    <p>This unoccupied stretch of land lies on either side of the river close to the
                        down town district of Mason City. Mr. Melson, looking quite melancholy when
                        he came to me, had had a dream and it wasn't coming true. He had asked
                            <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright to design a house for him but Wright had
                        no Town Planning sense and had designed just a house to set by the roadside.
                        So the poet in Mr. Melson wasn't satisfied. He came to me. You know I had a
                        romantic look.</p>
                    <p>But instead of taking up his suggestion I told him that this was a Town
                        Planning undertaking and suggested he talk it over with Walter Burley
                        Griffin which he did on the site and was taken off his feet with the
                        suggestions made for the general layout and for a dwelling for himself
                        carrying up an old quarry wall to form one wall of his home.</p>
                    <p>In addition Griffin suggested an artificial precipice by encouraging the city
                        to dump rubbish under quite a stretch of the bridge and facing it with the
                        local stone thus adding 3 building lots whose outlook would rake up the
                        river, and so on.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Melson's home was finished Griffin himself climbed up the wall from
                        river bottom to roof. The house is a lovely blossom in the natural terraces
                        of the river bank, with a secret afternoon-tea terrace on the level of the
                        floor of the billiard room accessible only from it.</p>

                    <p>He was known as Don Melancholio. He got sketches for his home from one
                        architect after another, including F.L.W. <note>Frank Lloyd Wright</note>,
                        but nothing satisfied him though one at least was charming enough as plans
                        go. But still he wandered on.</p>
                    <p>At about this time I had settled myself in the office of Walter Burley
                        Griffin. One day the Don came in and asked me if I would make him sketches
                        for his house. I begged off saying Mr. Griffin's office was pressed with
                        work and I felt in fairness to him I couldn't take time off for other work.
                        Then he revealed his problem. He and Mr. Blythe of Mason City had bought 18
                        acres on the banks of the river in their home town and would I make a
                        perspective drawing of it.</p>
                    <p>The spark caught and I said I thought I could do that but if it was a
                        landscape scheme he ought to talk with Mr. Griffin about it, and I showed
                        him some of Griffin's houses, etc. He had a talk, had Griffin go down to
                        Mason City for a day at the end of which the two gentlemen signed away their
                        so-called liberties in a contract which bound each of them to do nothing on
                        the property without Mr. Griffin's approval.</p>
                    <p>The two men had bought this property because they thought it a lovely spot
                        for a home. The rest of the river frontage had been ruined. Below was a
                        miserable factory, above a rubbish dump. The banker and the business man
                        then put off and put off building each mistrusting what the other might do.
                        To such impasses does this fetish of personal liberty, misplaced liberty,
                        lead us in our chaotically conceived social system which refuses to
                        recognize that a human community has three functions to fulfill and so
                        requires three complete community organs to fulfill them, one for equity,
                        one for liberty and one for mutuality, a political, an ability &amp; an
                        economic organ each consisting of the total citizenry. The Town Planner
                        would be an impartial arbitrator whose only personal interest would be to
                        maintain the high standard of the whole property.</p>

                    <p>And Mr. Griffin came home with the job of designing the home of Mr. Melson,
                        our Don, in his pocket. The other architects had handled the house simply
                        from the architect's point of view locating it at the normal building line
                        distance from the street frontage, but Griffin as soon as the house was
                        mentioned inspected the property to select a particular lot and advised an
                        abandoned quarry site on the river bank and drew a picture in Mr. Melson's
                        mind of a house perched at the extreme back of the lot on top of the quarry
                        precipice, continuing and giving finish to the quarry face, and commanding
                        views up and down the river. Melancholy flew out and an enduring enthusiasm
                        filled its place in our Don. Only once did it seem for a moment to have
                        returned when the old "sad face" appeared in the office saying he was going
                        to have to charge up his electric light bills to Mr. Griffin for - and then
                        the smile crinkles began - everyone, and that was the whole town, who
                        crossed the bridge - which connects "down town" with the residence district
                        - whether pedestrian or motorist stopped to look up the river at the
                        fascinating sight of Rock Crest's initial building - a castle indeed for it
                        was a unity with the whole precipice - completely reflected in the smooth
                        waters above the old dam; and he couldn't resist the temptation of keeping
                        his whole house lighted up to make the most of a spectacle of it.</p>
                    <p>A location was also selected for Mr. Blythe's home - on the opposite bank - a
                        gentle wooded slope, charming and gracious, extending from the house to the
                        river, a complete contrast to Mr. Melson's site.</p>
                    <p>Operations had scarcely begun when the town approached the owners to buy the
                        property for a park but they realized they should have done this long before
                        and rather than interfere with the men of vision in whose hands the whole
                        would be better safeguarded than in the hands of the officials, instead of
                        using their right of eminent domain they would perhaps take on the
                        restitution of other parts of the river frontage, perhaps converting the
                        dump into a park. They agreed to</p>

                    <p>Where the boundaries of the tract were not already set off by the natural
                        screen of forest growth, the structures have been disposed to make a frame
                        for this area as complete as possible, in conformity with its standards.</p>
                    <p>Moreover by the relegation of the houses to the perimeter the area of the
                        gentle slope to the river will be preserved indefinitely for open view very
                        much as nature designed and for those purposes of retreat and recreation to
                        which nature has so well adapted it.</p>
                    <p>The endless fascinating possibilities for domestic a architecture with the
                        unrepeated variations of view, soil, ruggedness, luxuriance, prominence and
                        seclusion, need only the due attitude of appreciation to work themselves out
                        in structures as unique as their sites, cut into rock or perched on the
                        crest or nestled in the cove as the case may be.</p>
                    <p>The dam has been reconstructed in concrete from that of the old time grist
                        mill that long occupied this site and whose foundation masonry is being
                        transformed into a modest hydroelectric plant pumping water to a reservoir
                        on the heights for fountain and hose purposes and generating electric
                        current for the illumination of the public spaces.</p>
                    <p>This dam is designed ultimately to be traversed by a concrete bridge
                        superstructure giving the architectural falls dignity and significance,
                        adding security to the boating on the mill pond and offering access by easy
                        ravine route to the crest outlooks. Walter Burley Griffin</p>

                    <p>accept Griffin's suggestion to dump their rubbish - not garbage of course
                        which should be burned in incinerators as it is done in Australia - along
                        and under the bridge's approaches to the river thus with stone facing
                        building up another precipice and enclosing the property making advantageous
                        building sites for three houses on this street frontage.</p>
                    <p>Of this Domestic Community Development Griffin says:-</p>
                    <p>Rock Crest &amp; Rock Glen occupy the two sides of the valley which
                        Willow Creek has carved out of the rocks within 3 blocks of the central
                        square of Mason City, Iowa. In common with many such beautiful pieces of
                        nature it has been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of
                        the commonplace sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems to be
                        approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently stimulated by
                        opportunity for unique development in those instances where long abuse has
                        not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the neglect. This
                        example comprises 18 acres of the creek frontage between two bridges. That
                        at the north is a permanent masonry arch carrying an important thoroughfare
                        route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but the western
                        footbridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in the near
                        future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream of a
                        territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression to be
                        preserved and respected.</p>
                    <p>The vertical bluffs of Willow Creek alternate from side to side of its
                        sinuous course. In the portion illustrated they comprise the south and west
                        banks, opposed by a gentle slope of meadow and open woods extending
                        gradually up to almost equal elevation north and west within the limits of
                        the tract. Wherever this rise has been less than that naturally, it has been
                        augmented artificially by grading and filling to form a commanding hill at
                        the north-east corner with lesser mounds and ravines masking the south
                        embankment of the State street bridge</p>

                    <p>approach and finally with a considerable rockwork precipice covering the
                        bridge abutments, matching in a way the bluffs from which the concrete arch
                        springs on the east and forming the semblance of a canyon.</p>
                    <p>Where the boundaries of the tract were not already set off by the natural
                        screen of forest growth, the structures have been disposed to make a frame
                        for this area as complete as possible, in conformity with its standards.
                        Moreover by the relegation of the houses to the perimeter the area of the
                        gentle slope to the river will be preserved indefinitely for open view very
                        much as nature designed it and for those purposes of retreat and recreation
                        to which nature has so well adapted it.</p>
                    <p>The endless fascinating possibilities for domestic architecture with the
                        unrepeated variations of view, soil, ruggedness, luxuriance, prominence and
                        seclusion need only the due attitude of appreciation to work themselves out
                        in structures as unique as their sites, cut into rock or perched on the
                        crest or nestled in the cove as the case may be.</p>
                    <p>The dam has been reconstructed in concrete from that of the old time grist
                        mill that long occupied this site and whose foundation masonry is being
                        transformed into a modest hydro-electric plant pumping water to a reservoir
                        on the heights for fountain and hose purposes and, generating electric
                        current for the illumination of the public spaces. The dam is designed
                        ultimately to be traversed by a concrete bridge superstructure giving the
                        architectural falls dignity and significance, adding security to the boating
                        on the mill pond and offering access by easy ravine route to the crest
                        lookouts.</p>
                    <p>For such coordination development various property interests had to be
                        brought together on the basis of a common ideal and bounden to it through
                        the extent of the tract so that the improvements have been going forward
                        from the various angles with the assurance and co-operation that can come
                        only from unified control.</p>

                    <p>The first thing Griffin sent back from Australia to the United States was
                        drawings of the general layout of future buildings and a key design for the
                        building groups for the University of New Mexico. He was very interested in
                        and sympathetic with the pueblo motif they were then using. Unfortunately
                        his young assistant <note>Barry Byrne</note> in Chicago in whose charge the
                        Chicago office had been placed was influenced, by the so-called architect
                            <note>Frank Lloyd Wright</note> whose vanity and malice killed the
                        so-called Chicago movement in architecture, not to forward these drawings
                        but to send down his own design for the building they were about to erect.</p>
                    <p>They erected it but were disappointed that it was so out of keeping with what
                        they were doing that nothing further was called for from the Griffin office.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately they afterward continued on the lines on which they had begun.</p>

                    <p>METHOD OF DESIGN . Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>In entering my second office I was graduated from pure drafting to experience
                        and began to function in my first stage of design in a realm fairly natural
                        to me, that of the art of the painter. Not till years later was I to learn
                        the radical difference between the art of painting and the art of
                        architecture. Painting and sculpture are depictive arts sculpture to be sure
                        including a sense of movement. But architecture is a spatial, a structural,
                        art and requires a quite different impulse and type of comprehension.</p>
                    <p>In this second office, that of F.L. <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright, we were,
                        to be sure, practicing as architects but were really functioning as artists,
                        as painters. I became sort of subconsciously aware of this difference when
                        Wright told me to design a flat roofed residence. This meant the building
                        must have the feeling of a home but must have a flat roof. I completely
                        failed in this as did Wright himself.</p>
                    <p>The most difficult of all architectural problems, the inexpensive dwelling
                        was never solved in that office. But when I passed from that stage of my
                        education into what might be called a post graduate school, in Griffin's
                        office, I was brought to a comprehension of spatial principles, structural
                        fundamentals, and the expression of soul requirements, or of human
                        requirements if you prefer to put it that way, and began to witness the
                        practice of <hi rend="ul">architecture</hi> in this our 20th century. This
                        was in Griffin's office about 1910.</p>
                    <p>I will illustrate by one instance, amplifying by another instance in present
                        day world architecture. I have spoken of the first requirement in the primal
                        landscape conditions of the Melson house of Rock Crest. These conditions
                        determined the placing of the house on the top of the quarry precipice. This
                        precipice determined the building material, the local stone. The river
                        facade of the building continued the sheer precipice to the top of the
                        house. That there should be no incongruity the roof was flat. When the house
                        was completed the rough stone treatment made it possible for Griffin to
                        climb the whole precipice</p>
                    <pb n="307"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 307 ====]</p>
                    <p>from river level to roof. This river frontage is 3 stories high. The lowest
                        story is the billiard room whose floor forms a continuation of a bit of a
                        terrace of the cliff which thus becomes accessible from the house, and only
                        from the house, from the side French windows of the billiard room, for
                        outdoor seclusion or hide away, or for afternoon tea guests.</p>
                    <p>Next above are the living rooms. The steep slope on one side of the house
                        means you can reach out over the windowsill of the dining room and pick wild
                        violets or other seasonal blossoms flowering at the level of the window
                        sill. On the other side the more gentle slope opens up lovely more distant
                        views. From the front windows you look out to the river and step out onto a
                        balcony veranda cantilevered out from the house so from here your view rakes
                        up and down the river, and looking down you see the flat river bottom land
                        with its garden laid out as a huge water lily, the paths separating the
                        petals, and lily pads of sward surrounding the flower display.</p>
                    <p>The top story is bed rooms and the garage, for to this level the drive can be
                        brought, so this is the level of the entrance to the house. A painter living
                        in this home could earn his living without ever leaving the house, the views
                        are so varied and so constantly changing. To dwell in such a house is to be
                        a living being. Most houses contribute only death forces to their
                        inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>In this house Griffin originated a motif which has had a world wide
                        influence. Here we are up against the problem of the flat roof. So simple a
                        means as making tall heavy triple stepped projecting keystones over the
                        upper windows does the trick. They function as well as ornament, which is an
                        expression of affection, of feeling, of joy in your work and in your
                        profession. They give the feeling of substantiality, of 3rd dimension, of
                        structure, of spatial reality, a very satisfying feeling to us mortals.</p>
                    <p>Griffin used this idea in many ways. Interestingly enough when one has done
                        creative thinking, this becomes a permanent contribution to</p>

                    <p>humanity, and this whether he has had the opportunity to put it into actual
                        construction or not, and this is especially gratifying in the art of
                        architecture where whether a design in carried into construction or not
                        depends not on the architect but on others, on the client. They
                            <note>creative designs</note> are accessible because the imaginative
                        forces are permanent in their nature and when once brought into creative
                        form in a creatively thinking being they remain for all time for they are of
                        the nature of duration, of other, and are not perishable. One who has the
                        power of consciousness in these etheric realms can have access to these
                        forces and bring them down to use in the sensible realms. This faculty is
                        the essence of genius.</p>
                    <p>The first office building for which Griffin made use of this motif has an
                        interesting history. There was a custom in Australia when giving a foreigner
                        a job, of requiring that he accept a partner whose only real function was to
                        collect half of the fee, a manifestation of patriotism. The working drawings
                        of this building as accepted by the clients when put to the city authorities
                        for passing bumped up against an objection to a certain projection of a roof
                        feature 10 stories above the street. This by the way was the first tall
                        building erected in Australia. So Griffin made an alternate design of the
                        facade using the stepped pier motif rising above the roof line and by their
                        depth taking away the thin feeling of the usual city building, since city
                        buildings frequently present only their front face to the public. At least
                        that was the case before the stepping back above certain heights was
                        required for light for the streets below.</p>
                    <p>The clients called upon the partner for advice as to whether this design
                        should be accepted. He was awake to its possibilities so advised against
                        accepting it. He then got to work with the Building Council and got the
                        first design passed which was then built. Before many months had passed he
                        built a city building using the Griffin design. It was not a handsome
                        building but the motif was there.</p>
                    <note>In Section II, No. 3., page 28ff, MMG relates a similar story involving
                        the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne.</note>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 310 ====]</p>
                    <p>You will see it all over the world now. As our steamer came into Madrid
                            <note>Madras</note> in India I saw it there, an office building nearing
                        completion, and used very charmingly. All around about one sees bridges so
                        designed, very handsome. The most impressive building of the recent New York
                        Exposition <note>New York World's Fair 1939-1940</note>, not counting the
                        replicas of ancient National types, was the Russian building, this same
                        motif, and so we find it in other buildings classed as modern architecture.
                        Much is the effect of creative design.</p>

                        ready when Griffin was called to Australia.</p>
                    <p>The house fitted the site like a glove. Since it was on the lower levels it
                        was flat roofed to least obstruct the views of the dwellings above.</p>

                        nature it has been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of

                        long abuse has not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the
                        neglect. This example comprises 18 acres of the creek frontage between two
                        bridges. That at the North is a permanent masonry arch carrying an important
                        thoroughfare route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but
                        the western footbridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in
                        the near future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream
                        of a territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression
                        to be preserved and respected.</p>

                    <p>SUNSHINE IN THE HOME . Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>Color is an essential element of all that exists in form. Without light and
                        color life is a term devoid of meaning. Possibly it is indicative of
                        subordination to objects other than life itself that modern civilized
                        existence is the drab, sooty and monotonous thing our city-dwellers know so
                        to hate, and get away from into the country whenever a chance offers, if
                        only to witness others' sport and play or even horses run or, at great
                        expense, trouble and annoyance, to spend a few hours somewhere in the open
                        at the week's end. How can it be explained otherwise so that a Melbourne
                        merchant has had to re-dye with that "fear" color, brown, thousands of yards
                        of those brilliant and effective henna shades, notwithstanding they were in
                        the height of fashion and much admired in every shop window.</p>
                    <p>The colors of nature are exuberance itself and play <note>"play" crossed out
                            in N-YHS</note> infinite in variety of combination and ever changing
                        during the passage of the sun. No painting on the wall can be an acceptable
                        substitute for a glimpse of a mountain view or a garden, and no place here
                        in Australia need be too small to afford for every day something of actual
                        animate nature if no more than a wall garden.</p>
                    <p>The obstacle that stands in our way in our home is the wall, a necessary evil
                        we assume but not one incapable of mitigation if we try. Verandas are
                        popular because they afford an escape on occasions though, unfortunately,
                        rare in many situations in our climate. One or two ordinary guillotine
                        windows do not suffice, however, to make daylight and life our own. Upper
                        sash must be almost continually blinded off to reduce glare. To appreciate
                        the value of eyebrows in windows, compare the clearness and brilliance of
                        coloring of nature viewed from under a low spreading tree and then from out
                        in the open.</p>
                    <p>The proper objective in a house should be as continuous a belt as possible of
                        windows between the landscape or garden outlook and the point of view of the
                        eyes when seated or standing, and with no more glass than in one double-hung
                        window, two or three times as much</p>
                    <pb n="316"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 316 ====]</p>
                    <p>prospect from our rooms is obtained with a single tier of sash, whether
                        single-hung, pivoted or swung. Otherwise the house is the lifeless prison we
                        generally have to put up with and accept as punishment for indifference to
                        nature's harmony and for submission to the rapacity of land exploiters who
                        would increase their income by herding us closer if they possibly could.</p>
                    <p>Of course full benefit cannot be expected from landscape windows if there is
                        no outlook but, in few, if any, cases is it necessary to accept such a
                        position at the time the house is planned. There are possibilities of making
                        landscape outlooks all the way from window boxes, suntraps and courts, to so
                        informally grouping our buildings (otherwise than in rows cheek by jowl in
                        stockaded pens) as to preserve to each whatever common outlook there may be
                        of gardens, parkways or distant views.</p>
                    <p>Then too, relative proportions and open connections between rooms have much
                        to do with their sunniness and liveliness and in overcoming the feeling of
                        confinement in cells. Doorways generally afford the sole communication but
                        partitions, windows, rails, screen walls and loges <note>N-YHS
                        reading</note> and gallery effects must become the rule instead of the
                        exception if we are ever to know in ourselves the romance we merely observe,
                        through these means, in the settings of the stage or the screen, where the
                        necessity for romantic expression is always recognized.</p>
                    <p>To reflect into the interior itself the colors of daytime, the most important
                        element is the carpet, whose reflection supplies most of the light from the
                        sky out of doors. Nothing is so good for this purpose as the glowing green
                        of the lawns or the buffs of the grain fields or the yellows of the sands to
                        which shades in similar relation to the eyebrows, we are accustomed by our
                        hereditary constitutions and which colors are by reason of their
                        universality in nature the most neutral in their effects on our dispositions
                        and psychology. Then too, they are economical of the light having high
                        reflecting power,</p>
                    <pb n="317"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 317 ====]</p>
                    <p>whereas the dingy reds, browns, and nondescript mixtures most commonly in use
                        on our floors are veritable robbers of life giving light.</p>
                    <p>The walls are next to the floors in importance as daylight reflectors in most
                        cases; and their importance in this respect is less often overlooked. But,
                        apparently since white can be more or less maintained on these surfaces, it
                        is accepted in its rawness or, almost unquestionably, in the form of pasty
                        tints as a substitute for whatever colors we may want. This seems to me
                        radically wrong for flat flour-pigment tints are a feeble compromise at
                        best, except with sheen or bloom such as are found only in flat coverings
                        beyond reach of the ordinary householder, including tapestries, silks,
                        metals and marbles. These are available only for incidentals.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, wall textures of rough plaster or gritty artificial stone
                        susceptible of brilliant tints and rich shades derived from the tints in the
                        middle range of the spectrum. These textures can be produced at no greater
                        expense than the ubiquitous hard, cold, cheerless plaster of paris, and it
                        is with them that the main possibilities of interior decoration lie.</p>
                    <p>How such a sepulchral finish as the plaster could have become accepted in the
                        community it is not easy to see for it as devoid of practical advantages as
                        of aesthetic adaptability. It is fragile and always becomes chipped; it is
                        absorbent and hence never free of finger marks and all kinds of smudges and
                        smears and it cannot be cleaned. It necessarily abounds in cracks almost
                        from the beginning and these have a clear smooth field in which to exhibit
                        all their vagaries; and finally, it affords no adequate or permanent
                        foothold for paint, paper or fabric covering so much demanded by its
                        inherent hopelessness.</p>
                    <p>Given however, a decent structural basis of floated lime or cement plaster or
                        a wire-scruffed burned clay, all that is necessary for the maximum of
                        elegance and finish in the interior walls is either a glaze or a stain of
                        some pure hue containing a large proportion of yellow.</p>
                    <pb n="318"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 318 ====]</p>
                    <p>The result may be tan, orange, salmon, yellow, olive, or sage, or anything
                        within the gamut of the sunshine colors but nothing nearer to either end of
                        the solar spectrum can be expected to carry sufficient brilliance to be
                        tolerated where God's day light is the objective.</p>
                    <p>The problem of the ceilings is different. These surfaces have the least
                        effect on the lighting in the daylight but are the all-essential reflectors
                        of artificial light at night. That, however is another story. It is
                        sufficient to say that, for such purposes they should invariably be tints
                        and as may be deduced from what has been said, warm glowing tints.</p>

                    <p>CIVILIZATION &amp; ITS FURNITURE . Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>In its furnishing, are the standards of our requirements based upon utility,
                        comfort, and appreciation of nature's own artistry? Or are they merely the
                        expression of a machine-ridden era and of a more or less indifferent public?</p>
                    <p>The Western peoples have necessities more or less artificial and arbitrary
                        which it may take some thousands of years to eradicate: we have yet to grasp
                        the simplicity of a really old and fully developed civilization without even
                        beds or chairs for instance. Among the longer civilized races domestic
                        ornament in generally restricted to single or significant objects of
                        interest; it is not, as with us, an objectless accumulation with few, if
                        any, outstanding features. It is gradually becoming recognized now that the
                        less furniture a house contains, consistent with its needs, the better. This
                        is a phase of aesthetics which has been most evident among the people of the
                        Orient.</p>
                    <p>Australia is an Oriental country, and if our civilization embraces adaptation
                        to environment, climatic influences may eventually bring about a
                        corresponding reaction on the part of the people.</p>
                    <p>CONSIDERATIONS OF COST</p>
                    <p>Although the tendency of modern furnishing has long been toward excessive
                        elaboration the question of the beautiful and infinitely varied household
                        effects of Europe, dating in style from the Middle Ages, is denied us by
                        reason of high cost. The best we have been able to attain in that direction
                        is a monotonous procession of machine-made imitations of "period" furniture.</p>
                    <p>The result is seen in the mass of low quality impedimenta exposed in the
                        shops and offered as achievements of the art of furnishing. Even the cost of
                        the upkeep of this "period" trash, despite the use of various mechanical
                        devices for cleaning and refurbishing, is so serious a matter as to make
                        inevitable some steps towards a rational equipment for living in accord with
                        modern conditions.</p>
                    <pb n="321"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 321 ====]</p>
                    <p>MISUSE OF BEAUTIFUL MATERIALS</p>
                    <p>In the first place the machines that turn out hard mechanical reproductions
                        of highly wrought designs, are surely capable of doing within their
                        limitations more perfect, accurate and highly finished work in lines adapted
                        to machine methods.</p>
                    <p>There is an inherent beauty in all natural materials that can be brought out
                        by mechanical working in a higher degree than any other way and this is the
                        feature that should be sought rather than the intricacies of man-made
                        design, which only the continuous operation of creative imagination can keep
                        alive.</p>
                    <p>It is to the pattern of the marble, the grain of the wood, the weave or pile
                        of the fabrics and textiles, and the patina of the murals, the luster of the
                        glass that we have to look now instead of to the cunning of the craftsman,
                        otherwise the grinding tedium of the operation is too obvious. It intrudes
                        all too noticeably and the result, despite a mathematical precision, is
                        disappointment and dissatisfaction. It is an art that is too admittedly
                        "faked." For simple lines and plain surfaces the beauty is in the greatest
                        degree provided by the material itself; nature's contribution, beyond all
                        effective imitation. Here are texture, mottle and color in endless variety
                        that our facilities can bring to the surface if we don't attempt to overlay
                        or off-set them by meaningless decoration.</p>
                    <p>THE FUNCTION OF FURNISHINGS</p>
                    <p>With furniture whose charm lies in qualities of nature's providing a vaster
                        scope than in the days of handicraft is opened up to the modern home
                        builder.</p>
                    <p>In a consistent singleness of motif an individuality of the home as a whole
                        comprising ground, house, furniture and furnishings there is in fact a scope
                        for design open to our age that was never possible before the invention of
                        machinery. The aesthetic function of the furniture and furnishings is not
                        now to attract attention to itself or to its</p>
                    <pb n="322"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 322 ====]</p>
                    <p>individual specimens but to carry out and express a larger creature of the
                        imagination a home as unique in general conception as in all its parts.</p>
                    <p>Such a scheme in the first place should rest upon a given measure of rhythm
                        or module, the necessary condition of harmony supplying the scale of all the
                        appurtenances as well as the envelopment and the structure itself.</p>
                    <p>FIXTURES</p>
                    <p>A great deal of what has been and is being carted from house to house in the
                        incessant migrations of our present day life represent sheer waste of effort
                        and wear and tear since certain features are essential to certain rooms
                        which should never be built without them. For instance no bedroom can be a
                        bedroom without a wardrobe which, integral with the structure, takes up a
                        fraction of the space and represents a fifth to a third of the initial cost
                        of the much less effective and more troublesome and clumsy transported
                        encumbrance to which our British communities are inured. Kitchen cabinets
                        are coming to be seen in this light too and book cases, fuel bins and
                        settees, which are not frequently taken into account in the building but
                        require to become general to rid the community of a large share of the
                        bugbear of moving day.</p>
                    <p>Already, fortunately, lighting and cooking and heating equipment are not
                        necessarily nor even generally portable and are therefore recognized
                        elements of the home in its fixed environment and as such make for that
                        opportunity of individuality in each case which machinery and organization
                        offer to replace the more restricted scope for inventiveness and expression
                        that belonged to the handicraft era.</p>
                    <p>Little use as yet is being made of the greater scope because evidently we are
                        still restrained in our minds, however free may be our hands, and so the
                        forms even of indirect lighting today mostly ape the lamp shades of
                        yesterday. However, there is no need for any home builder to follow in the
                        rut for in his own building he can complete these</p>

                        not happen to intervene, as is often the case.</p>
                    <p>CARPETS</p>
                    <p>The first item after the building is the carpeting, the design of which must
                        usually precede the wall decorations because the field of selection and the
                        bounds of cost, and available materials are usually more restricted.</p>
                    <p>Only of late has anything been offered in our shops so suitable as the
                        perfectly plain rugs, without borders even, in rich autumn shades and, as
                        yet, nothing is better where the conditions of use are suitable. But, of
                        course, there is sometimes a practical objection to these in the matter of
                        keeping clean and it is fortunately becoming possible to find now and then
                        two-tone or unostentatious all-over patterns in subdued coloring that are
                        not imitative and do credit to factory looms.</p>
                    <p>HANGINGS</p>
                    <p>As to hangings there is now a wealth of wonderfully beautiful textiles in all
                        fabrics to meet every sort of requirement as to economy or richness in plain
                        or decorative weaves and in "texture" patterns that need little or no hand
                        work adornment to provide all the liveliness and interest that can be
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>It is remarkable that opportunities in this direction are not made much of in
                        our houses where often portieres <note>curtains hung over open
                        doorways</note> are better adapted to the necessities than doors or blinds
                        or shades or screens and they give an atmosphere of comfort and completeness
                        not matched by the much more expensive alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Wall hangings, on the other hand, suitable enough for nomads and tents and
                        hutments for armies or Arabs, are not properly a feature of the modern fixed
                        house which lives up to the opportunities of modern construction since
                        nothing so flimsy as paper or cloth laid over the more substantial structure
                        of the building itself can share the dignity, strength and permanence that
                        inhere in the exposed surface of integral materials of the building whether
                        stone, clay, mortar or timber.</p>

                    <p>FURNITURE</p>
                    <p>Bedsteads presumably must long continue to be portable, but the sooner they
                        more nearly approximate couches than the old four-posted canopied affairs
                        from which they are gradually degenerating the better for our health and
                        convenience and the more variously useful and spacious will our apartments
                        be for oriental couches afford in fact the most comfortable and sociable and
                        flexible seating accommodation possible.</p>
                    <p>Either over-stuffed or wicker chairs are more adaptable as yet to a style of
                        our own times than the machine products of wood which latter are
                        economically made in larger numbers and require more thought then the
                        factories yet give to design or other than imitative lines. Grace in the
                        simple wood work frame is all that is required but this is most over-looked
                        in the craze for pretense.</p>
                    <p>Wooden tables are essentially massive and simple enough to permit of their
                        manufacture to order for any particular home that aims consistently toward
                        individual homogeneity without increase in cost.</p>
                    <p>For the finish of the furniture, as in fact for the finish of most of the
                        woodwork of the house on these lines, wax in some form affords the only
                        surface coating that will conserve to the maximum the natural qualities for
                        which we have started out.</p>
                    <p>APPLIANCES</p>
                    <p>There is not much room for 'objects d'art' complete in themselves in our
                        homes for the multiplicity of already accepted needs in dishes and useful
                        devices and instruments and in the receptacles for a profusion of plants and
                        flowers give in themselves more scope for affectionate interest than can be
                        distributed so widely. Especially is this so in Australia. Simplicity,
                        evident lack of effort, alone in a great majority of all these effects is
                        the key to restfulness in the aggregate.</p>
                    <p>The very especial features to which attention may be attracted are properly
                        the craftsman's product easily designed or chosen in any time and place in
                        character with the individuality of the home.</p>

                    <p>FROM CHICAGO TO THE ANTIPODES</p>
                    <p>What an American learns in Australia and how difficult it is to impart to
                        others is the theme of this record. If it were not so important one would
                        not attempt it. But when one sees the consequences manifest, as they have
                        done at the end of a quarter of a century in frightful wars encircling the
                        globe, and more terrible things lying in our near future unless cures are
                        provided, one dares do no less than make the attempt <note>"to" inserted in
                            N-YHS</note> pass on to the coming generations the information gained
                        through what may be called the unique experiences of one man.</p>
                    <p>After all man is a unique being. He is not just a digit in a genus or species
                        nor any longer in a race. For the course of evolution of humanity has been
                        toward the development of a complete individual, and the time has come,
                        however recent it may be, when we are as likely to find a great creative
                        molder of humanity among one people as another. It may be a <note>Leo</note>
                        Tolstoy in Russia or a Sun Yat-sen in China or a <note>Thomas</note>
                        Jefferson among Anglo Saxons or a Dr. <note>George Washington</note> Carver
                        among Americans.</p>
                    <p>Here we find a clue for our story, for America (the United States) is a
                        unique thing in the world - a great natural region where for many
                        generations, running now into several centuries, but organized only since
                        1776, any human being could come and live, earning his living and practicing
                        his religion on even terms with anyone else, not barred from even the
                        highest office in the land. Only in this deadly century did the community
                        degrade itself by putting up immigration barriers. But the very nature of
                        democracies opens the doors to mistakes but at the same time makes it
                        possible to rectify them.</p>
                    <p>With a world organization now pending there may come a solution of this
                        problem which will naturally melt down these barriers without calling for so
                        high a moral test as the present rescinding of those acts of cowardice.
                        After all people are home lovers. The Gods are certainly holding their
                        breath to see what the beings to whom they greeted that incredible gift of
                        free will do in this testing time.</p>

                    <p>Griffin's post graduate course of education began with the Canberra incident,
                        a unique thing in many ways but chiefly in the fact that it united two poles
                        of the earth - Chicago and Canberra. I would like to make an appeal to the
                        imagination. If you could see what I have seen you would see a child born
                        with a vision. He fashioned it through into a reality though he had to "Jamb
                        it down their throats." He died under the power of an Indian Oriental spell,
                        at least our Indian gardener thought so - thought that the Gods had accepted
                        Walt's life in the place of his wife's. And in his return to earth in a new
                        incarnation he sees humanity falling to pieces because men of our time will
                        not heed the message seers have given them. Is it ever thus with our seers?
                        Can we never learn to listen and give heed?</p>
                    <p>The Sun was in the zenith when Burley Griffin was born - high noon - which
                        would bind his life - as the orientals among our European peoples think -
                        with the antipodes as in other polarities where up is bound with down or
                        inside with outside. If you project a line from America through to the
                        center of the earth it will hit the realm of the ancient Lemuria whence
                        Australia sprang. There at about the same time another man was born. James
                        Alexander Smith was ruled by the Midnight Sun which bound him to the land of
                        his birth though he was much better known in other lands than in his own - a
                        great creative scientist to whom many doors were opened in the Western
                        Hemisphere among them a complete laboratory and to do as he liked by our
                        Westinghouse Company.</p>
                    <p>But to fulfill their vision these two men had to come together. The
                        Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while
                        still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two
                        people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but
                        one must fight the whole past to the death to make them come true - "sweat
                        and tears and blood."</p>
                    <p>Australia's favorite slogan "Australia for the Australians" rang from the
                        Southern Hemisphere to the Northern and was taken up there</p>
                    <note>James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a
                        member of the board for the Canberra design competition.</note>

                    <p>by the Indian cry "India for the Indians." Well do I remember the
                        astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise
                        that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan, and I answered -
                        of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of
                        what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in
                        such limited visions, such self-centered hopes. Mr. <note>John
                        (Joseph)</note> Curtin, the present Prime Minister has taken further steps
                        which I'll take up later.</p>
                    <p>This one man Smith working, as he did all his life, behind the scenes
                        gathered others about him, suggested here, directed there and brought about
                        the Federation of the States and, written into the constitution was the
                        requirement that the location of the Federal Capital must be determined
                        within ten years.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time from a baby following his mother through the garden patting
                        the flowers lovingly as he went, from a schoolboy held back in his grades a
                        year because he spent his time drawing city plans, laying down their basic
                        principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet
                        built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of
                        communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign,
                        Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created for him
                        thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin
                        came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the
                        world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete
                        confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all the
                        architectural publications for the announcement of an international
                        competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous
                        for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intended should
                        happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world
                        at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by
                        means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a
                        story</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 329 ====]</p>
                    <p>indeed. The two men won for after all, in human affairs, all initiative and
                        all creative power lies in the will of individual men. What a man sets his
                        will to he can accomplish (especially if he gets a pal to work with him).</p>
                    <p>In this interim Burley Griffin had added unto himself a wife and "very
                        sensibly" as she overheard a client of his saying to him, "had picked an
                        architect" and indeed a useful slave she proved to be. A year passed and
                        there, to her unbelieving eyes, was the announcement. On request, complete
                        data for the same was received from Australia. But the office was busy and
                        weeks and months passed till 9 weeks before the drawings would have to be
                        sent the Mrs. performed that valuable Xanthippe function for which the wives
                        of great men are famed.</p>
                    <p>During my early life I was led by the passing Will o' the Wisp in what I did
                        - drawing, dancing, drama, architecture. Not so after my marriage - Yes even
                        before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful
                        person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I
                        presently became deeply centered in the task of lending a hand in all the
                        various emergencies that arose. Truly I lost myself in him and found it
                        completely satisfying. That is the normal difference between men and women
                        though the task of each is now to become a complete human being - both
                        receptive and creative. Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as
                        well as our greatest agonies.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>In the Holahan house the living veranda is an extension of a natural cave in
                        the hillside, lovely and cool for the summertime. The garage in this case is
                        on the level of the street.</p>
                    <p>Even these two groups - Trier Center and Mason City - to say nothing of
                        Australia and India show Griffin's endless versatility whereas what
                        variations arose in <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright's work, even to the raft
                        foundation about which he has had so much publicity, came from other
                        sources. His first houses nondescript, the Winslow house Old Colonial, the
                        Morse house on Oak Park avenue half timber. The Walser house, T shaped, the
                        first diversion from the rectangle, entirely my design, my first in his
                        office, the Husser house my design for our family's home in Hubbard Woods
                        except that 2 two squares instead of 2 octagons flanked the long oblong.</p>
                    <p>It was Griffin who brought the Thomas house up out of the ground with an
                        English basement and a right angle plan, etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>The enthusiastic and able young men as proved in their later work were
                        doubtless as influential in the office later as were these early ones but
                        Wright's early concentration on publicity and his claims that everybody was
                        his disciple had a deadening influence on the Chicago group and only after a
                        quarter of a century do we find creative architecture conspicuously evident
                        in the United States.</p>

                    <p>UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES <note>by Walter Burley Griffin</note></p>
                    <p>Quite aside from the stereotyped colors and the crude patterns of most of our
                        rugs there is the fatal defect which practically all of our rugs have of
                        lacking any connection with the motives in design used in other parts of the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is more trying to our nerves or displeasing to the eye than to have a
                        lot of heterogeneous motives huddled together, for a design is an expression
                        of an emotion and the jarring effect of a lot of indiscriminate visual
                        motives is quite as great though not at present so clearly understood as
                        would be the throwing together of snatches of music of different character
                        as pastoral, and jig, and hymn and dirge.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese are right in using from their stores only one decorative
                        ornament as jar, picture, statuette, flower group, at a time set off by the
                        simplicity of the general treatment of surfaces. The room itself should be
                        beautiful before anything is brought into it.</p>
                    <p>The confusion to which we doom ourselves when we use figured wall papers,
                        figured rugs, figured curtains, figured upholstery, is responsible for much
                        of the weariness of the women who spends so much of their time in the house,
                        for peevishness of children who cannot he expected to understand the causes
                        of their discomfort, and for grouchiness of men who need rest when they come
                        home from a day's work, who would resent being obliged to listen to
                        discordant notes constantly jangling in their ears and, if sufficiently
                        intelligent to understand the cause of their discomfort, would recent being
                        subjected to discordant visual notes.</p>
                    <p>We understand this fact of harmony or discord in music. In the course of the
                        centuries it finally dawned on us that there was a law in accordance with
                        which sounds were pleasing or displeasing to us. We studied into the nature
                        of the law and then we entered into the great, new, limitless world of
                        music, a heaven of measureless delights. As the Kabalistic writings say -
                        "When we name a new angel and know</p>
                    <pb n="333"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 333 ====]</p>
                    <p>its duties we become its master," or as it is put in accordance with the
                        modern manner of thinking - when we know a law and its functions to that
                        extent we gain control over nature and become powerful accordingly.</p>
                    <p>We have discovered the Angel of Color. We are just beginning to learn its
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>But the Angel of Proportion, the significance of line and angle and form, the
                        meaning and value of motif and design we are hardly aware of.</p>
                    <p>But a building is line, form, motive, and until we realize that they must be
                        used in conformity to law to be pleasing we will get occasional satisfying
                        results as are found in barbaric music but no great or growing architecture
                        and as all things act and react on each other so the very development of our
                        character, of our souls, is dependent on these laws of nature which are
                        spiritual as well as physical in themselves and in their effects.</p>
                    <p>A motive in design must therefore be used with great care, we can take a
                        simple theme which alone may give relief to what might otherwise be a
                        monotone too severe to be entirely desirable. Such a note can be very
                        charmingly introduced in a home by a bit of design with perhaps a touch of
                        color in the window glass. Any evidence of affectionate treatment of any
                        useful element in a structure is very pleasing. This same motive, or
                        developments of it, can be carried into the case doors and illumination
                        fixtures. There is no limit to the elaboration possible and beautiful in
                        following this plan. The design can be carried into a rug or the draperies
                        or the china but always the designs must be related to each other either by
                        conformity or contrast. It is not possible to say that any one degree of
                        elaboration is better than another. Each one is a song. Only to overdevelop
                        one part and neglect another would be as bad as to put the treble of a
                        symphony with the base of a finger exercise. Balance of all parts</p>

                    <p>is essential. This matter of balance depends primarily on the arrangement of
                        the plan of the house. The necessities of the small house holder are totally
                        different from those of larger establishments and the introduction of
                        elements which are most convenient in the latter case into the former
                        problem resulting from lack of realization of the difference in the problem
                        often leads to waste, extravagance and actual inconvenience. This often
                        happens when a pantry is being considered where there are several servants
                        to prevent too great confusion in the one room, to enable the housekeeper to
                        have a place to work where she will not interfere with the cook, or to
                        separate the confusion of a room where people are working from the dining
                        room, but in the bungalow where one does one's own work or at most employs
                        one assistant, it means added steps, inconvenience in getting at implements
                        and materials, waste of space. A small kitchen properly arranged with
                        cupboards on the walls is not only an economy in building but a most
                        desirable arrangement for the housekeeper. When we stop to think what meals
                        can be turned out of the tiny kitchen of a dining car we are brought to a
                        realizing sense of the wastefulness and inconvenience of our ordinary
                        domestic arrangements. Again the space used for hall and stairway in a large
                        house become most inconvenient in a bungalow. The plan should be so arranged
                        that in a compact and restricted area access can be given to all the various
                        parts of the house as entrance, living room, kitchen and second story while
                        maintaining the privacy of each and avoiding making a thoroughfare of any.
                        The grand stair way appropriate enough in a palace with its functions of
                        pomp and parade become an absurdity in our domestic life, a manner of living
                        totally unknown two centuries ago.</p>
                    <p>The flexibility of a small house is much increased by throwing the living
                        rooms together so far as possible, for no matter how small the family there
                        are many times when for social purposes it is necessary to have a large
                        room. Nor does this arrangement interfere with</p>
                    <pb n="336"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 336 ====]</p>
                    <p>the proper fulfilling of the separate functions of living and dining room for
                        the nature of these two rooms is such that when one of them is occupied the
                        other is empty.</p>
                    <p>The economy of throwing the space of the two together is obvious. The
                        necessity of separating guests from the confusion of elaborate service does
                        not exist. Such separation of dining table from living quarters as might
                        occasionally be needed can be easily effected by the use of a screen. On
                        festival occasions the whole space can serve as dining room, arranged with
                        tables which can be easily removed leaving a fine big room for frolic when
                        the feast is done. Indeed I have known very small houses that could
                        entertain on a much larger scale than really big houses, simply as a
                        consequence of a well thought out plan.</p>
                    <p>Small rooms, each capable of being cut off from the others, is an arrangement
                        no longer called for by the old difficulties of heating, nor by the old
                        difficulties in housekeeping which made it easier to keep one room
                        immaculate, ready for the reception of the occasional guest. We live too
                        close to each other in these days, too intimately, on too <note>reading from
                            N-YHS</note> democratic a footing to make us wish to have a little show
                        spot. We open our homes as our hearts and are not ashamed of our
                        occupations. It is no doubt convenient to have one room, call it a reception
                        room or den or grouch or study or office, where seclusion is possible but
                        under ordinary circumstances this need is subordinate to the more constant
                        and pressing needs of our everyday life where more and more we are becoming
                        conscious of harmonizing and unifying the interests of all the members of a
                        family, men and women, old and young - a movement permeating all our
                        community as we see evidenced in our movements for equality of opportunity
                        in education and business and politics, as we see it in the social center
                        movements unifying the social life of old and young, bringing together all
                        the elements of a community.</p>

                    <p>UNITING TWO POLES</p>
                    <p>Griffin's post graduate course of educating the profession of the world began
                        with the Canberra incident, a unique thing in many ways but chiefly in the
                        fact that it united two poles of the earth - Chicago and Canberra. I would
                        like to make an appeal to the imagination. If you could see what I have seen
                        you would see a child born with a vision. He fashioned it through into a
                        reality though he had to "Jamb it down their throats." He died under the
                        power of an Indian Oriental spell, at least our Indian gardener thought so -
                        thought that the Gods had accepted Walt's life in the place of his wife's.
                        And in his return to earth in a new incarnation he sees humanity falling to
                        pieces because men of our time will not heed the message seers have given
                        them. Is it ever thus with our seers? Can we never learn to listen and give
                        heed?</p>
                    <p>The Sun was in the zenith when Burley Griffin was born - High noon - which
                        would bind his life - as the orientals among our European peoples think -
                        with the antipodes as in other polarities where up is bound with down or
                        inside with outside. If you project a line from America to <note>"through"
                            substituted in N-YHS</note> the center of the earth it will hit the
                        realm of the ancient Lemuria whence Australia sprang. There at about the
                        same time another man was born. James Alexander Smith was ruled by the
                        Midnight Sun which bound him to the land of his birth though he was much
                        better known in other lands than in his own - a great creative scientist to
                        whom many doors were opened in the Western Hemisphere among them a complete
                        laboratory and to do as he liked by our Westinghouse Company.</p>
                    <p>But to fulfill their vision these two men had to come together. The
                        Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while
                        still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two
                        people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but
                        one must fight the whole past to the death to make them come true - "sweat

                    <p>Australia's favorite slogan "Australia for the Australians" rang from the
                        Southern Hemisphere to the Northern and was taken up there</p>
                    <note>James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a
                        member of the board for the Canberra design competition.</note>

                    <p>by the Indian cry "India for the Indians." Well do I remember the
                        astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise
                        that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan, and I answered -
                        of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of
                        what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in
                        such limited visions, such self-centered hopes. Mr. <note>John
                        (Joseph)</note> Curtin, the present Prime Minister has taken further steps
                        which I'll take up later.</p>
                    <p>This one man Smith working, as he did all his life, behind the scenes
                        gathered others about him, suggested here, directed there, and brought about
                        the Federation of the States and, written into the constitution was the
                        requirement that the location of the Federal Capital must be determined
                        within ten years.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time from a baby following his mother through the garden patting
                        the flowers lovingly as he went, from a schoolboy held back in his grades a
                        year because he spent his time drawing city plans, laying down their basic
                        principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet
                        built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of
                        communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign,
                        Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created for him
                        thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin
                        came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the
                        world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete
                        confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all the
                        architectural publications for the announcement of an international
                        competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous
                        for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intended should
                        happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world
                        at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by
                        means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a
                        story</p>

                    <p>indeed. The two men won for after all, in human affairs, all initiative and
                        all creative power lies in the will of individual men. What a man sets his
                        will to he can accomplish (especially if he gets a pal to work with him).</p>
                    <p>In this interim Burley Griffin had added unto himself a wife and "very
                        sensibly" as she overheard a client of his saying to him, "had picked an
                        architect," and indeed a useful slave she proved to be. A year passed and
                        there, to her unbelieving eyes, was the announcement. On request, complete
                        data for the same was received from Australia. But the office was busy and
                        weeks and months passed till 9 weeks before the drawings would have to be
                        sent the Mrs. performed that valuable Xanthippe function for which the wives
                        of great men are famed.</p>
                    <p>During my early life I was led by the passing Will o' the Wisp in what I did
                        - drawing, dancing, drama, architecture. Not so after my marriage - Yes even
                        before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful
                        person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I
                        presently became deeply centered in the task of lending a hand in all the
                        various emergencies that arose. Truly I lost myself in him and found it
                        completely satisfying. That is the normal difference between men and women
                        though the task of each is now to become a complete human being - both
                        receptive and creative. Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as
                        well as our greatest agonies.</p>

                    <p>We can see that liquid does not really belong to the mineral kingdom. Water
                        for instance when it solidifies expands. We can see this in the form its
                        crystals take, its frost crystals foretelling the living vegetable kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The pine family originated in the South Pole. The Auricaria in Australia

                    <p>The vegetable kingdom transforms spirit into matter, mathematics to life. The

                        photograph of light), in the shade the crescent or double crescent of the
                        chemical ether, water forming. Australia's Archangel was the greatest of
                        artists playing with color and form, in barks and leaves as well as flowers.

                    <p>Plants do not consume food, they create it. The 19th century knew only the
                        mineral kingdom. Before life it confessed itself ignorant. Spirits conceived
                        life into the triangle and ellipse archetype. Goethe sensed this.</p>

                    <p>To understand a tree, or anything else, we have to know where it came from
                        and who made it. So for trees we have to search the universe and we look out
                        and see the sun and moon and the stars. Now then we look at a child, say all
                        bundled up for a cold winter day we see her clothes and not the child
                        herself so when we look at the stars, and the nearest and so to the eye the
                        biggest star is the sun, we see the garment of the Sun Being, the most
                        powerful of all the Beings that we know anything about. These starry Beings
                        are Fire Beings, great spheres of fire, so we can picture them by drawing a
                        great circle. And we can show these great Fire Beings working and playing
                        together by</p>

                    <p>drawing many circles -A-. In working together these Spirits of Fire form
                        ideas. You see here already they have formed the idea of plant life, of the
                        leaf form - of the clover leaf - and, as the great poet Goethe told us and
                        as all the scientific world now knows, the leaf form is the original parent
                        of all plant life. We call that parent form the archetype.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Then the Sun Beings laughed with joy and said let us tell all creation what
                        we have done and the Sun Beings joined the Fire Beings who had come down
                        from the great primeval Saturn, the origin of the Solar system whose rings
                        still tell us the story of the origin of substance which the smashing of the
                        atom has now confirmed. They sang - Let us illuminate the world so that all
                        may know of this lovely thing and all the lovely things we do. So they
                        created radiating light. They illuminated the world -A- <note>"-B-" in
                        AIC</note>. They sent out great radiating streams of light, for from heat we
                        can't get light. Not until the great Spirits said, "Let there be light." So
                        with light a new form was created - the triangular form -B-.</p>
                    <p>Now these Beings love to work in rhythms, we call that the music of the
                        spheres for all music, all sound, comes from rhythm. We call it vibration.
                        So there was Light and then when the Spirits rested they called in the
                        Spirits of Sound. The light ceased for a time and then there was darkness
                        which is just as real a thing as light. This was the creation of the Moon
                        Beings. In it the Moon Beings play. They are -C- </p>

                    <p>restless Beings always in movement so they were perpetually throwing up waves
                        and music filled the universe for these waves are sound waves. The shape of
                        these waves is the half circle or the crescent. We know that the other side
                        of the moon which is turned away from the sun, is dark</p>

                    <p>so the real nature of the Moon is darkness. So when the Moon Beings threw up
                        their crescent waves against the radiating light they got the forms built up
                        by the interplay of light and darkness and these are the living things for
                        the Spirits of Light and Darkness keep things moving and growing all the
                        time, the light filling things with color and the dark filling them with
                        sound so they can be both seen and heard -D-.</p>

                    <p>Let us watch how these forms grow. Higher and higher the waves are tossed,
                        taller and taller the radiating triangle grows. In the meantime the
                        different stars have played another game. You see all ideas are created by
                        the Fire Beings. The Stars have been throwing their radiating beams across
                        the sky and in their crossings a new form has been created, and then many
                        new forms. Let us see how it works -E-. A star is a point in the universe.
                        Each Star throws out certain beams, sometimes one kind of beams sometimes</p>
                    <note>Beside the remainder of this paragraph is drawing "E" -- two stars and a
                        quadrilateral.</note>
                    <p>other kinds of beams. Let us watch their play. Two Stars send out a message
                        each a living thing and a quadrilateral is created. All these great beings
                        have children and we human beings call these children of the angelic Beings
                        Fairies.</p>
                    <p>We have spoken of the Star Beings, the Sun Beings and the Moon Beings but now
                        we have come to the Earth Being whose children, the gnomes, help her to live
                        and grow. For when the Earth has come into existence as an idea of one of
                        the Fire Spirits the other Fire Spirits become interested and begin to send
                        out their rays and the quadrilateral is formed, the gnomes get busy to keep
                        this form fixed, a solid material body and as the stars create form after
                        form -F- the Gnomes gather them together and build up the solid Earth as we
                        know it.</p>

                    <p>For as the stars send out rays and rays they build up all the wonderful
                        crystal forms in creation and the solid earth is made up of all those lovely
                        crystals that the star beings imagined.</p>
                    <p>Then all the fairies got together in council to see if they couldn't bring
                        all the lovely forms that the heavenly beings were creating to the Earth
                        where they could use the crystals to build up all sorts of lovely living,
                        shining, moving, singing creatures.</p>

                    <p>So now we all show you what children can do. For the children of men can do
                        wonderful things as well as the children of the angels. These began to build
                        up a tree. They first of all had to have the idea of a tree for no one can
                        build even a chair without first having the idea of a chair.</p>
                    <p>So they watched and listened to the angelic beings till all of a sudden the
                        Undines shouted for joy for they were the children of the Moon Beings and
                        they had seen the lovely forms the Water Beings were tossing up into the
                        triangle of the Airy Beings, the Light Beings. So in council they told the
                        fairies and they all agreed to help bring these forms into the Earth which
                        had now be become a solid body with water and air and warmth around it. The
                        Undines being water fairies had to ask permission of the gnomes to transform
                        some of their crystals into liquids. The gnomes agreed and began to design
                        passages in the rocks so that as the Undines, who were the chemists, worked
                        they could help them to change the form of the crystals from the usual forms
                        to the forms of water crystals, the frost, which grows and spreads out
                        branches, and the gnomes made it possible for these forms to last for quite
                        a while, not as long as the earth crystals for you know how quickly</p>

                        plants, as the years and centuries passed, to climb higher and higher till
                        we got trees as tall as the Sequoias of California or the gum trees, the
                        Eucalyptus trees, of Australia.</p>
                    <p>One of the very first trees ever created was the fern tree which we still
                        find growing in Australia. At first this is a very low and widespreading
                        triangle, but now some of them are higher than a house.</p>
                    <p>This fern tree has no seeds but just little spores on the leaves like other
                        ferns. The Sylphs, who are the Air fairies, and the Fire Fairies saw what a
                        wonderful time the Undines and the gnomes were having so they offered to
                        help. So the Sylphs designed all sorts of flowers and painted them all sorts
                        of colors for they are the light fairies so they contributed not only the
                        air for food but also condensed the light into tiny comet like bodies and
                        fed it to the plants making it possible for the flowers to develop.</p>

                    <p>And then the Fire Fairies built the fruits and seeds so that myriads of
                        different kinds of trees and plants could come into the earth world.</p>
                    <p>And it is as well that they did so for the earth itself, the crystals,
                        neither animal nor man can eat. Only the plants are smart enough to
                        transform crystals into food and of course they could not do it if the
                        fairies didn't show them how. The Fire Fairies have command of the formative
                        forces which is the warmth ether which as I told you creates spherical forms
                        so they could not do much for the plants at first. We recognize their work
                        in the fruits which are mostly more or less spheroid. Sometimes we see that
                        the sylphs have helped them as in the seed of the pine tree which is a
                        triangular pyramid. We see how they helped the Undines too in building the
                        tremendously tall triangle of the trunk of the fern and the pine so very
                        symmetrical in form. Especially in these early works of the fairies was the
                        work of the first hierarchies, the star beings and the sun, evident in the
                        form of the plant as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Fairies built the fruits and seeds<lb/> so that myriads of different kinds

                    <p>The Normal Residential Quarter Section would have 8 major parks.</p>
                    <p>Griffin has shown here how when adjacent to a factory district two of the
                        major parks might be eliminated.</p>
                    <p>He has also shown an arrangement with 4 major parks. No further reduction
                        should be tolerated yet we find self-styled Town Planners of 1944 presenting
                        as town planning a duplicate of this street system with no interior parks,
                        squeezing them out by adding a few more streets.</p>
                    <p>With such moral standards on the top levels it is no wonder that juvenile
                        crime is increasing so menacingly. The low moral standard of the whole
                        community is evidenced in the private assumption of public values - the land
                        values, which should be used by the Social Organ in giving opportunities to
                        every individual to develop his capacities to the maximum.</p>

                    <p>Wrong in every particular.</p>
                    <p>What would happen of course is that the parks would become business buildings
                        since quarter section through streets will become through streets
                            <note>"thoroughfares" in N-YHS</note>.</p>
                    <p>Also central school buildings would give way to the thoroughfares which
                        dotted lines indicate since no other way across is provided. The schools
                        would thus ultimately be on the corners of thoroughfares.</p>

                        and an exclusively street car accessibility must, according to general
                        tendency in similar portions of Chicago, imply for this site adaptation to a
                        predominantly residential function. Since the site is flat and the problem
                        an economic one, irregular curves and acute intersections may be entirely
                        avoided.</p>

                        somewhat on the lines of The Capitol Theatre but of course entirely
                        different. In this case the proscenium did not conceal an organ but was
                        aglow with an orange light the source of the light of course completely
                        obscured. The light flowed through the design from concealed lamps.</p>
                    <p>It gave such a glow apparently of heat that there were no longer any
                        complaints of chilliness in the auditorium.</p>

                    <p>1.11 As Part of Chicago</p>
                    <p>1.111 Focal Industries. -<lb/> Chicago is pre-eminently an industrial
                        organism whose focal functions are connected in a gridiron system of main
                        streets and avenues at half-mile intervals with occasional radial highways,
                        all equipped with steam railroad, surface tram, or overhead rapid transit
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>1.112 Local Industries.</p>
                    <p>1.11201 Location. -<lb/> Local industrial functions are found generally
                        distributed along these circulating avenues, and therefore on this typical
                        tract will eventually <note>"be" inserted in N-YHS</note> found along the
                        greater part of the perimeter.</p>
                    <p>1.11202 Area. -<lb/> By comparison on the basis of population the frontage of
                        the perimeter is proved excessive for local industries so that only about
                        five-eights of that frontage is allotted to business.</p>
                    <p>1.11203 Unit Allotment. -<lb/> These lots are all rectangular with alley
                        shipping frontages as well as street store frontage free from alley
                        crossings and of 100 feet depth.</p>
                    <p>1.1121 Transfer Station. -<lb/> Since the points of greatest traffic will be
                        the most accessible and valuable sites, the most general local industries
                        will naturally start at the existent transfer corner in a special arcade
                        court structure that will be dignified and important as a keynote. Built
                        full to the street line, with three arcaded sheltered approaches and a
                        fountained courtyard, there is accorded a window frontage of 1480 lineal
                        feet for the small popular stores. A two story office tower corner feature
                        may effect a befitting terminal</p>

                        as terminal gateway features to the shorter avenues, and include postal,
                        police, and fire stations, ward office, water, gas, and electric offices,
                        bank and rental offices.</p>
                    <p>1.1123 Street Assemblage Units. -<lb/> Corner allotment must for safety be
                        given to popular amusement establishments.</p>

                        contiguous to the most valuable corners are the retail stores, wherein
                        vending alone is carried on, comprising display and sales spaces for
                        groceries, drugs, confections, cigars, liquors, dry goods, furniture, and
                        furnishings.</p>
                    <p>1.1125 Trades Units. -<lb/> A different class of industries naturally to be
                        set next, and of less continuous demand, are the trade shops, permissible
                        only in single-story structures on account of light requirements, fire risk,
                        and noise. These are the bakeries, restaurants, barber shops, laundries,
                        paint, plumbing, and carpenter shops, photograph studios, and garage.</p>
                    <p>1.1126 Bulk Storage and Supply Units. -<lb/> On the least valuable
                        circulation avenue are placed the larger industrial units of wood-yard, fuel
                        and building material supply depots, and possibly a community heating plant.</p>

                    <p>1.21 As Part of Chicago. -<lb/> Considered thus it seems advisable to develop
                        independent communities within the limit of local acquaintanceship, apart
                        from the external disturbing influences.</p>
                    <p>1.22 As Integral Domestic Group. -<lb/> As the internal attractions will have
                        to compete with those of the external city, they must be so organized as to
                        raise the popular standards and minimize the evil influences found
                        <note>in?</note> a multitude of time-killing pursuits.</p>
                    <p>1.221 The Community Unit. -<lb/> In the center of the tract, its most
                        accessible point, is provided a community group, consisting of the common
                        with music pavilion set in a reflecting basin with bordering aquatic
                        gardens, tree-shaded promenade, and public gardens setting off refectory,
                        assembly buildings, library, and amphitheatre, and a colonnade connecting
                        four eight-room public schools eventually necessary.</p>
                    <p>1.222 Educational Units. -<lb/> The four schoolhouses are placed at one
                        community center for economy of administration, within range of a
                        quarter-mile of separate continuous children's playgrounds radially
                        disposed. Schoolrooms are preferably set with the cardinal points of the
                        compass.</p>

                        substituted for the street areas of the built-up city or the isolated
                        playgrounds of the slum districts. The advantages of parental oversight by
                        reason of contiguity to the home are thus secured. Variety is afforded by
                        garden accommodation to some, modest play courts to others, children's
                        playgrounds with apparatus or water facilities, and to many ample fields for
                        each sport in season, including football, baseball, basket-ball, lacrosse,
                        handball, tennis, croquet, cricket, and banked running-track to be flooded
                        for winter skating rink.</p>
                    <p>1.226 Two-Family Units. -<lb/> The two-family house has become established in
                        our developing Chicago residence districts to such an extent that we are not
                        warranted in ignoring it. The proportion of these units is entirely flexible
                        in this scheme, in which about 18% has been introduced, these are placed on
                        lots of most accessibility to transportation line and on street corners,
                        utilizing the lots with smallest back yards.</p>

                        encouraging gymnastics and physical activity, the American Turners developed
                        organizations which promoted social and cultural services (along with sports
                        activities) for German immigrants.</note>

                    <p>1.227 Family Units. -<lb/> It is to be hoped that the individual house and
                        grounds will long be the dominant features of our cities.</p>
                    <p>An allotment of 30 feet will allow a house of two good rooms in width, with
                        entrances at the center of one side, leaving street and garden frontage free
                        for outlook, and when staggered, a vista from the two sides also. Verandas
                        are thus free in the rear where house fronts are maximum distances apart and
                        free from intrusion. These lots are 100 feet deep, with additional backset
                        of 15 feet belonging to the city, but planted and maintained as an
                        individual holding, and securing a spacing of 60 feet between building
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Gardening is not a universal avocation here as in England, so that less
                        private yard recreation space is to be provided. Hedges and irregular
                        shrubbery constitute the better means of separating and beautifying the
                        neighborhood lawns in one harmonious parklike ensemble.</p>
                    <p>For sunlight in all rooms each day an arrangement of houses with diagonal
                        points of the compass is most important in our climate; seventy percent are
                        here so placed.</p>
                    <p>Inside the house, the concentration of entrances and stairways utilizes the
                        space least useful for occupancy. Here a back alley approach becomes
                        unnecessary and rear outbuildings functionless.</p>

                    <p>2. COMMUNICATION. -<lb/> This phase considers the means of connecting the
                        specialized sites with the general facilities for transportation, being
                        tributary to the existing surrounding system, yet discriminating as to the
                        kinds and quality of service desired.</p>
                    <p>2.1 EXTERNAL TRAFFIC.</p>
                    <p>2.11 Boundary Highways. -<lb/> The prevailing boundary highways of 66 feet
                        width are here maintained, also the continuity of the abutting streets, to
                        avoid confusion. It is inevitable that there will be some distinction in
                        importance between the existing street car lines, determining the most
                        valuable part of the tract, in which the development will begin, and from
                        which it can progress normally without intervening vacant spaces, as is
                        apparent from the geometric plan.</p>
                    <p>2.2 INTERNAL TRAFFIC.</p>
                    <p>2.20 General. -<lb/> A minimum width of 60 feet is here fixed between
                        frontages on communication ways serving as access to buildings, giving a
                        suitable backset from actual public ways, whose widths are determined by
                        their transit needs as inferred from their length, character of occupancy,
                        and tributary feeders.</p>
                    <p>2.201 Nomenclature. -<lb/> A simple system of nomenclature is important, and
                        is possible here.</p>
                    <p>2.202 Equipment.</p>
                    <p>2.2021 Vehicle Pavements. -<lb/> These are to be considered of ample width at
                        25 feet in the more important ways, and at 18 feet in the lesser ways, being
                        sufficient for a vehicle to pass one backed against the edge.</p>
                    <p>2.2022 Pedestrian Pavements. -<lb/> Sidewalk pavements are 4 feet for purely
                        residential routes allowing promenade two abreast.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>From across the valley this tiny minimum cost house looks like a castle. The
                        low entrance hall and bathroom ceiling emphasized the flanking rooms whose
                        effect is further increased by the fact that the corner closets and
                        cupboards are stopped at doorhead height and form flower boxes (the plants
                        were not yet established when this photo was taken).</p>
                    <p>The supporting columns at the entrances are carried above the roof height and
                        topped by flaring tangents to form lanterns adding charm to the total
                        composition.</p>
                    <p>This design illustrates how the cheapest home may out-rival its expensive
                        neighbors. The roof is concrete thus adding living space. It commands
                        magnificent views down the valley.</p>

                    <p>In the primary routes 6 feet width is conceded. The pathways of the
                        playgrounds are 4 feet wide, a minimum amongst shrubbery.</p>
                    <p>2.2023 Parkings. -<lb/> A parking of but 2 feet width will permit planting of
                        evergreen creepers for easy maintenance, and can be omitted entirely at road
                        intersections where additional vehicle width is welcome.</p>
                    <p>2.2024 Trees and Shrubbery. -<lb/> Residential ways are both natural and
                        dignified, being short, straight avenues lined with different species of
                        trees and massed shrubbery, all confined to the abutting allotments.</p>
                    <p>2.2025 Illumination. -<lb/> Illumination of narrow ways can be sufficiently
                        diffused from relative low standards, possible of execution as ornamental
                        concrete lanterns.</p>
                    <p>2.2026 Conduits. -<lb/> A public service conduit in each trafficway is here
                        contemplated, to be built of concrete in the trench excavated for sewer,
                        furnished with stubs and manholes, and equipped with all public service
                        mains.</p>
                    <p>2.21 Distribution. -<lb/> The functions of internal lines are to reach the
                        homes quickly and to meet the needs of distribution and collection to and
                        from these homes. Study of this project shows it to be continuous for such
                        service, without being attractive to thoroughfare usage.</p>
                    <p>2.211 Segregation. -<lb/> It is important to arrange internal lines to
                        seclude the domestic community from industrial circulation. No streets are
                        therefore allowed to pass through without diversion.</p>
                    <p>2.212 Congregation. -<lb/> This function is for periodic domestic social
                        amenities, in contradistinction to the streets of a general city which are
                        for concentrating and circulating traffic in large numbers and drawing
                        trade. Filtered</p>

                    <p>through the segregating system, cut off from through traffic, this function
                        is only periodically operative, as for the children at certain times of the
                        day and for the adults at evening.</p>
                    <p>2.2121 Private Congregation. -<lb/> This reassembling of the individuals
                        first takes place within the buildings in the family and club and inn
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>2.2122 Neighborhood Congregation. -<lb/> The garden <note>reading from
                        N-YHS</note> fronted park, play fields, play courts, and gymnasium courts of
                        various sorts are supplemented by an informal winding scheme of paths with
                        irregular shrub and tree plantations, forming a circulating pedestrian
                        parkway suitable for children and for infants' go-carts.</p>
                    <p>2.2123 School Congregation. -<lb/> The advantageous location of the schools
                        at the internal ends of the bisecting centerways makes the shortest possible
                        distances between home and school, which are thus not more than two blocks
                        apart.</p>
                    <p>2.214 Associations Congregation. -<lb/> In general these features are cross
                        linked for interfellowship by the octagonal circuitway with two objectives
                        terminating a vista at each turn.</p>
                    <p>2.2125 Community Congregation. -<lb/> The location of this function in the
                        geometric center is established for reasons of accessibility, isolation from
                        external influences, and to emphasize its importance to the city as the
                        unified social expression of a 6400 community. The central functions are
                        joined together by a protected passageway as a promenade for students and
                        visitors, overlooking the public gardens setting off the pool with its
                        central feature of an open pagoda designed as a music pavilion.</p>

                        <bibl>ECONOMIC REVIEW OF THE PLANS<lb/> by<lb/> Robert Anderson Pope</bibl>
                    </p>
                    <p>The high degree of intensity or this plan is shown by its 1224 lots, with
                        their average dimensions of 37 x 100 feet, and is commendable, yet this
                        intensity has been accomplished at the <hi rend="ul">lowest cost</hi> of any
                        of the plans submitted. It has <hi rend="ul">not</hi> secured this result at
                            <hi rend="ul">the sacrifice of park and playground spaces</hi>, which
                        are situated in such a way as to enhance land values very materially. The
                        arrangement of houses secures for many the maximum possible exposures.
                        Therefore the intensity has not been achieved at the expense of sunlight and
                        air.</p>
                    <p>The distribution of community objectives along the boundaries of the
                        quarter-section is certainly desirable as far as the commercial units are
                        concerned; but it is improbable that for an area of this size such a large
                        percentage of community features would be economical. Therefore a location
                        of these commercial objectives along the two car lines, instead of on all
                        sides, would seem to be the better design.</p>
                    <p>It is especially good designing from an economic standpoint that the
                        non-commercial community objectives are splendidly distributed to secure a
                        high economic value.</p>
                    <p>The street system of this plan, from the standpoint of convenience to the
                        external objectives or car lines, is only about one-third as efficient as
                        the theoretical ideal which would project all blocks and streets
                        perpendicular to the car line, were <hi rend="ul">other considerations not
                            more important</hi>. This point is the only major economic deficiency of
                        this design.</p>
                    <pb n="373"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 373 ====]</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of convenience of reaching by this street system the
                        interior objectives, we find a very high degree of efficiency, and therefore
                        of economic worth.</p>
                    <p>Again, this design has accepted the definite hypothesis stated in the
                        introduction, i.e., that the through thoroughfare is economically
                        detrimental to a residential area - as this plan has only two streets that
                        would have any tendency to invite cross traffic and, even if invited, such
                        traffic would be negligible on account of the extent of detour involved by
                        the central public space - a detour which would, of course, be saved by the
                        use of the thoroughfares flanking this quarter-section.</p>

                        In the interior as well as in the exterior they served as decorative
                        features instead of simply holes punched in indiscriminately.</p>
                    <p>The corner fenestration groups used by him - revolutionary at that time -
                        were by no means offensive to the eye giving a feeling of instability, but
                        gave distinction and power to the design.</p>
                    <p>The dignity of design and permanence of construction, the house including
                        roof of concrete, made possible the location of this low cost dwelling in

                        from the wealthy neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Note the engineering revolution in the corner groups of windows which has
                        become so general now after a quarter of a century but which is treated
                        architecturally, graciously, instead of being the bleak thing it is in the
                        hands of modernistic builders. The mullion having become a special
                        structural feature is treated as such adding human interest to the
                        structure. So treated it does not give the feeling of a face with the front
                        teeth knocked out.</p>
                    <p>Nature can run riot about this concrete home and the burned tile fireplace
                        front designed by the architects brings a touch of it into the living room.
                        This landscape decoration which forms the breast of the fireplace is burned

                    <p>ARCHITECTURE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT TOWN PLANNING</p>
                    <p>Gutzon Borglum likens methods prevalent in the practice of architecture to a
                        prostituting of the profession, the architect subsisting on the life blood
                        of his draftsmen. The taste for this sort of thing is whetted and the
                        conscience salved by the fact that in this unreasonable social system of
                        ours it is only too common to find the man who works starving while, through
                        some special privilege, the man who does not work feeds fat off the fruits
                        of the other man's labor.</p>
                    <p>Our predecessors, our teachers, our ancestors should not be drags, parasites
                        feeding off the tissue of our spiritual growth, causing arrest of
                        development or degeneracy, even as physically the parents of many of our
                        children do in factory towns. They should be inspiration and incentive to a
                        geometrical progression in achievement, rejoicing in the greater
                        accomplishment of those following. A teacher is no teacher at all unless the
                        work of his pupils exceeds the quality of his own and each generation is
                        under obligation not only to do its own work but so to teach the succeeding
                        generation as to cause progress. And here is the only value of tradition.</p>
                    <p>In the work of radical architects we find constant resemblance to the work of
                        other men and other people even Oriental, Aztec, Moorish, Japanese, Greek,
                        Gothic and primitive. But their difference from the copy-book school is that
                        they employ the same natural method and do not consider external form first
                        and shamefacedly hide behind it as best they can the element of use. They
                        glory in the laws of nature where everything has its purpose, and "Form"
                        becomes satisfying only when it best fits and expresses that function. They
                        believe not in art for "art's sake" but that art consists in doing necessary
                        things in the best possible way - that art except as a result of need,
                        physical or spiritual, is degenerative instead of progressive; that in this
                        creation of ours the ideal must be based</p>
                    <note>Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941) was an American sculptor, most famous for
                        carving the faces of four U.S. presidents on Mount Rushmore, South Dakota.</note>

                    <p>on the real; that nothing is practical except the ideal.</p>
                    <p>The concept of "freedom" is infinitely attractive and the influence of the
                        first man who definitely stated and expressed it in the architectural field
                        in America, Louis Sullivan, has been very widespread in his own country and
                        elsewhere. It must not be confused with the idea of democracy which is
                        purely the realm of Equity. Mr. Sullivan's intelligent comprehension of the
                        principles he was working on made his own work a continuous progression and
                        gave it a remarkable variety whereas an interest simply in one's own
                        achievement leads gradually to an imitation of one's self and a stereotyping
                        of manner and motives which, bit by bit, transform even rational
                        architecture into personal architecture. For problems are ever new and one's
                        work must be either static or developing.</p>
                    <p>The fact that similarity of conditions and materials and methods of
                        construction will, if rational methods are used, lead to similarities of
                        form is what develops the styles of various times and peoples. For style is
                        perceptible only in the large, is no concern of the individual designer, but
                        only of the historian. We find also the intermediate men who, though
                        following this method of thinking, would deny this right to others making
                        claims as grotesque as those of Bottom <note>in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
                            Night's Dream"</note> who would be the lion too. The consequence of this
                        greed was that the development of this movement was seriously handicapped in
                        the neighborhood of its origin. In the intellectual or imaginative world we
                        must recognize the right of every man to the use of his own thinking powers.
                        Priority in claim no more gives a man a right to monopolization than it does
                        to the land or the air.</p>
                    <p>How deadly is the effect of such claims we can see when we consider what
                        would have been the consequence to the development of Gothic architecture if
                        the man who claimed first to have used a buttress had been able to deny
                        others the right to use it, or if at any stage, say when the flying buttress
                        was used, any such attempt had been tolerated. There never would have been
                        any Gothic architecture.</p>
                    <pb n="378"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 378 ====]</p>
                    <p>The development of a style anywhere at any time is dependent on freedom to
                        use all the powers of nature - physical, intellectual, spiritual. It is,
                        however, not sufficient that man use his reasoning powers for this faculty
                        can disport itself in fantastic fields entirely unproductive. If his efforts
                        are to be fruitful he must learn the laws of nature and act in conformity
                        with them. The old Greek fable is forever true. Man loses his strength when
                        he takes his feet off the earth. To know is his chief obligation on this
                        earth. He must, therefore, not only have the courage to depend on his own
                        faculties but he must develop them and must take the pains to learn all the
                        facts which may have a bearing on his problem.</p>
                    <p>Our thoughts to be moral must conform to cosmic laws. We must not think
                        personally where causes are cosmic. All forms in matter or thinking derive
                        from the chemical ether which is the manifesting force as compared with the
                        spiritualizing forces of warmth and light. It is the central region of
                        America that is ruled by the chemical ether whose basic manifestation is
                        liquidity with its moving wave forces, the great Mississippi valley, and
                        there we find the founders of creative thinking in the arts, the modernists
                        - Lois <note>Loie</note> Fuller and Isadora Duncan in the dance, George
                        Bernard <note>George Grey Barnard?</note> in sculpture, Leo Masters
                            <note>Edgar Lee Masters?</note> in poetry, Louis Sullivan in
                        Architecture, Walter Griffin in ground planning, town planning or whatever
                        you wish to call it. Though all new movements derive from one individual
                        since ideas arise in the human mind, when that has happened the way is open
                        to all humanity to carry on the work. The foundation has been laid. Louis
                        Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was felt
                        as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully in the early
                        decades. His successors vary in degree of creative power but they are not
                        founders. The delay in the development of creative design was largely due to
                        the malicious vanity of one <note>Frank Lloyd Wright</note> who had been
                        inducted by Sullivan himself.</p>
                    <pb n="379"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 379 ====]</p>
                    <p>The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every
                        field of life, in every occupation; and taking maximum advantage of its
                        gifts is the task of the designer. The power of a conscientious
                        consideration of all the elements of a problem was brought home to me when I
                        saw the revolution in methods and results that took place when landscape was
                        made a part of architecture, when Griffin entered into partnership with
                            <note>Frank Lloyd</note> Wright. It meant not only a broadening of view
                        but a positiveness of action arising from the firm foundation of definite
                        facts determining the general scheme before taking up details of internal
                        requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean gardening as an
                        afterthought to a building but means consideration of the external elements
                        before starting to plan or build <note>reading from N-YHS</note>. Not only
                        natural conditions but the character of the surrounding buildings have
                        sometimes to be taken advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. We must
                        consider not the mere personal point but must look to the advantage to
                        everyone affected, for it is curiously true that a thing to be a permanent
                        advantage to one must be of advantage to everyone, just as in animal or man
                        a sound organ is of vital importance to all the organs. Human society is an
                        organism and the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all
                        since all are independent as root, branch, leaf and flower of a tree.</p>
                    <p>On the whole in America as well as elsewhere a building, a residence, was a
                        parallelogram. Nothing else was done. The Greek thinking was back of this, a
                        religious recognition of the 4th period of our present human cycle as the
                        pyramid was a recognition of the 3rd the Egyptian period. Once the
                        parallelogram was established the almost automatic thinking of our times
                        flowed on in the same old grooves. After all the mechanical is the idol of
                        the present age so why not leave our mind to its tendency to work
                        automatically.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 380 ====]</p>
                    <p>Now in this 5th period the tradition was finally broken down. The plan was
                        not necessarily a parallelogram, and freer forms developed to be carried on
                        later by Griffin in an endless variety of crystalline forms for he conceived
                        of buildings not as facades but as three dimensional. This is creative
                        thinking. We learn that there are as many universes as there are crystalline
                        forms each created by a great primal Spirit of Mathematics.</p>

                        ground floor of a down town building under the light well of the building
                        and consisted of five rooms separated not by walls but by great piers which

                        this way isn't it. Well I was born silly. And then I want to remind you that
                        you are to drop me a line from Honolulu. I waked at 5 this morning and lay
                        abed till eight just thinking it over, then I got up and have spent most of
                        the day in the yard. A lovely day it has been, the air perfect. I have
                        written eight letters and now as starting off to Detroit
                        <note>Michigan</note> with Mr. <note>Herman</note> Von Holst to see that all
                        goes well with the Henry Ford dwelling. Do tell me everything. No just drop
                        me a line. It's a pity to spoil a good outing by writing letters. But a line
                        I must have. Love from your cheerful (honest) wife, Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>Well me darlint, you must be somewhere in the neighborhood of Pango Pango
                            <note>Pago Pago?</note> now which inclines me to be foolish again. But
                        you love me just the same - no es verdad? Have you decided by now to leave
                        me in the States for the next few years while you get Australia straightened
                        out? May be Mr. Lawrence can't get along with women but he and I get along
                        fine. Mr. Jackson was in yesterday. Wanted to meet Mr. Lawrence. He said the
                        trustees wanted me to come down once, that they valued my opinion highly.
                        Thank heaven he said either before your return or afterward with you. It was
                        a very pleasant courtesy and he put it in a very pleasant way. Of course I
                        chose to go with you later. My thought is with you constantly, my love, your
                        love, Marion</p>
                    <p>Am working here alone this afternoon - Saturday - so of course am thinking of
                        you. <note>Roy</note> Lippincott went up to Racine <note>Wisconsin</note>,
                        found the canoe all right and left it where it was. People very nice and
                        would take nothing in way of pay till you came for it yourself. Said it was
                        no bother to anyone there. We have the possibility of a new home to build in
                        Ravinia <note>Highland Park, Illinois</note> for a Mr. Hubbard - about the
                        size of Ralphs <note>Ralph's?, i.e., Ralph D. Griffin, WBG's brother</note>.
                        Your cable made it seem not so far away. Glad to be informed of the
                        situation up to date but I'm getting homesick for my old man. As going to
                        Elmhurst tonight to have a new dress tried on. .....</p>

                    <p>I should have said that we sent back the revised sketches of the
                            <note>Stinson?</note> Library to Monroe and they returned them saying -
                        go ahead with the working drawings. Miss Hoffman stayed down late the other
                        evening working on specifications, got locked in and stayed all night. Mr.
                        Lippincott has worked out Compton and seems to be satisfying them.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>It's so hard to write a lot of stuff when the probabilities are that you'll
                        be home soon. I have decided that one might just as well be the wife of a
                        sailor as a city planner. I don't expect ever to get any satisfaction out of
                        you again. The only letter in which I wrote you must come home right away
                        (My knees were cold) was returned to me. Evidently fate did not intend I
                        should put any such pressure on you. Your poor desperate wife, Marion Mahony
                        Griffin</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>I enclose a jolly letter from Clara <note>MMG's mother?</note>. I sent you an
                        amusing one from Gerald <note>MMG's brother</note>. He signed it on the
                        typewriter saying his fingernails were all smashed except his thumbs and
                        that he had written this letter with his thumbs. Would you think it feasible
                        for Gerald to go into contracting and could we use him on the Trier Center
                        work. If Mr. Blount <note>a home developer in Beverly, Illinois</note> could
                        why not Gerald. Mr. Von Holst sent me a copy of the letter he wrote Mr.
                        Felton concerning the publication of the <note>David M.</note> Amberg
                        dwelling. N. certainly has colossal nerve. In two weeks more you would have
                        been home if you had'a come <note>reading from N-YHS</note>. Anyhow there
                        surely will be letters. Miss <note>Stella (Miles)</note> Franklin was so
                        delighted with your enthusiasm about Australia. She does hope you won't let
                        Sydney shippers spoil the Harbor Gardens. Marion Mahony Griffin</p>

                    <p>Dear Walter (from <note>WBG's</note> sister Gertrude), Three cheers and then
                        some. I just got a letter from Father telling of your cablegram (appointment
                        as Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital). Isn't it
                        wonderful that you actually are going to build your city. It's almost more
                        that I can realize, but I am so happy about it that I can hardly keep from
                        shouting it aloud. Your appointment isn't really so much of a surprise after
                        reading the clippings from the Australian papers but one</p>
                    <pb n="388"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 388 ====]</p>
                    <p>is never fully prepared for such things. I've read that message a dozen times
                        to get the full extent of its meaning but it will have to soak in gradually.
                        To say I congratulate you or to express my feelings in any kind of words
                        would be wholly inadequate but you know anyway how more than happy I am
                        about it. Six months leave of absence and then back to Australia for three
                        years! It's plain to see that your permanent place of residence will be your
                        capital city. I do so wish that it wasn't so awfully far away especially as
                        I fear that teaching will never pay me enough so that I can afford such a
                        long trip. As glad as I am about your appointment I can't be glad that you
                        are going to be at the other end of the earth and I don't see how we are
                        ever going to be able to get along without you. With much love, Gertrude.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Walter me darlint, I can't write you about business. I don't care anything
                        about business. I want you. It seems as if I'd suffocate, there are bands of
                        iron around my heart so it can't beat. The joy in my soul over your
                        beautiful success can't entirely keep me from being sick to see you. I wish
                        I could have gone over with you. I shouldn't have wanted to be in the melee
                        but everything would have gone perfectly well here without me. Mr. Lawrence
                        is the most conscientious and painstaking person on earth and Roy is too
                        though he worries Lawrence quite a bit by going off sailing on the lake when
                        according to Lawrence's standards he should be working. With Gerald here I
                        think we are going to have an organization that will be able to carry the
                        work during your absences. But I cannot live on business. In fact I'm
                        working less and less. Two months more is a dreadful long time. Each week
                        seems like a month. I keep counting wrong, thinking two weeks have gone when
                        only one has and then it seems as if time was standing still and you never
                        would be back again. However I'm trying to feel that this postponement is
                        the last one. Please come home. Marion</p>

                    <p>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD</p>
                    <p>As a friend said - "Now we have 5 minutes let's discuss the history of the
                        world." We have indeed to go back to the beginnings to catch up with the
                        ends, to understand the ends. For the world and its creative forces do not
                        work on straight lines like rational thinking. Creation works in circles and
                        spheres.</p>
                    <p>Go on the straight line through the center of the earth and we land in
                        Australia which fills us with amazement but we can understand nothing. Let
                        us take a circle and encompass a sphere and we can learn, and so shall be
                        able to accomplish what is necessary to accomplish in our time. For we have
                        come to a time when isolation will not work. Humanity must be treated as a
                        unity.</p>
                    <p>We traverse the Pacific Ocean, the great realm of fire on the earth,
                        practically the whole volcanic realm. We remember that warmth was the <hi
                            rend="ul">original substance</hi> of the solar system still functioning
                        here on earth as are unicellular beings so that man may read the story of
                        evolution. Politically, or shall we say from the latest step in the
                        evolution of human society, we start from the end - America - take the
                        plunge and find the beginning. We have perhaps flown, taken the modern way,
                        traversed the realm of the air, the 2nd condition of matter, the realm
                        through which we experience light and color - the rainbow and its
                        reflections in the creations that follow. We come down in the great ocean -
                        the whole southern hemisphere almost - the 3rd condition of matter, and find
                        the very earliest bit of solidity still existing - the 4th condition of
                        matter - Australia, which has indeed run into the extreme of fixity, the
                        wooden pear <note>an Australian tree</note> a type of all its fruits - a
                        time when the angels didn't have to provide for the feeding of human beings
                        on earth.</p>
                    <p>On this continent we find the forms of creatures of the watery realm fixed on
                        land in the vegetable life - the sea cucumber in a great Sterculia tree -
                        and in one of the Sterculias the octopus with its thick body and its waving
                        outstretched arms now living on dry land - the</p>

                    <p>Angophora trees on the bluffs of Sydney harbor, pink barked like a child's
                        cheek, lovely yet gruesome till you understand and learn to adore, records
                        of the ancient Lemurian continent and the origins of the vegetable kingdom,
                        coming out of the watery realm up into the airy realm.</p>
                    <p>Here in the human community we find the most ancient aboriginal people taking
                        degrees in the stiffest Sydney University courses, proving that differences
                        in race have ceased to exist since Christ gave that "light" to every man
                        that cometh into the world. The English lads and lassies love to become as
                        dark as our negro people through basking in the sun of this earthly
                        paradise. And the custom of competition for prizes in the Queensland schools
                        was given up because usually the schools of the aboriginal children
                        overtopped the others.</p>
                    <p>Here in Australia we find that wickedly ingenious device of imperialism - the
                        parliamentary form of government which makes the functioning of democracy
                        impossible though seeming to be its implement. From this hoax America was
                        saved through the genius of its founders who know of their own experience
                        the nature of this evil form and invented a new one - the Congressional -
                        under which dictatorship can be made impossible.</p>
                    <p>And yet here we find Mr. James Alexander Smith, a most highly developed
                        individual, functioning in full freedom and - almost single-handedly -
                        defeating these powers behind the screen and consummating the unification of
                        the Australian States and the establishment of a Federal Capital City,
                        Canberra which is the only modern city in the world. This is one of the
                        greatest stories of modern times. All the imperial interests were against it
                        - all the big interests. But we'll skip that for the moment. The end, our
                        aim, is to find a way to cure our sick civilization, to make it possible for
                        our communities to function wholesomely, free from disease. This cannot be
                        done unless we have a</p>
                    <note> James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a
                        member of the board for the Canberra design competition.</note>

                    <p>properly organized community. And this cannot be attained unless our children
                        are properly educated. This is not possible unless all the children have
                        access to nature, natural continuous contact throughout childhood - all of
                        them. Otherwise they cannot develop inventive or creative powers to say
                        nothing of health. The geniuses come from the rural districts not the urban.
                        To give the children this is not possible without community planning which
                        facilitates decentralization, puts an end to overcrowded cities and an end
                        to wide open spaces too sparsely occupied. It interlaces the urban and the
                        rural.</p>
                    <p>And only in Australia has this been done on a scale to make it tell. Not only
                        Canberra but several other municipalities which Griffin planned before he
                        went to India where he found these depths of the Orient immensely interested
                        in modernism. Those are greatly mistaken who think India could not function
                        on even terms with the rest of the world in a World Economic
                    Organization.</p>

                    <p>In the course of perfecting the rational faculty, necessary to give men
                        confidence in their own decisions as a basis for free will, the power to
                        receive revelations was necessarily withdrawn from men for a time. Through
                        Anthroposophy, the Twentieth Century science, which, along with the smashing
                        of the atom in the atomic bomb, revolutionizes thinking for this century as
                        material science did the thinking of the nineteenth century, this power of
                        receiving information directly from the spiritual realms can again be
                        developed but it must now be in a Christian form and not pre-Christian if it
                        is to be wholesome and developmental. This difference of method is of vital
                        importance and is but little understood today so that many unfortunate
                        things are happening through the longing for direct knowledge of spiritual
                        realities without any comprehension of the nature of Christian requirements.</p>
                    <p>Since the creation by the Christ was the creation of a being who could attain
                        to responsibility which is dependent on free will and, since with His coming
                        into the Jesus being where He dwelt for three years, He gave to man the
                        individualized Ego (which he gave to every man that cometh into the world)
                        which marked man's maturity and readiness to function in free will, the
                        power to develop the faculties necessary for the reception of revelation
                        must reside in each individual human being.</p>
                    <p>But since the all important factor is the retention and development of free
                        will, no method must be used now which dulls man's fully awake consciousness
                        nor which interferes in the slightest degree with the free action of his
                        will. The only form of occultism recognized by natural science is hypnotism,
                        but these scientists know nothing of what they are actually doing nor can
                        they know its dangers nor its serious or even fatal consequences. The
                        process used is to substitute another's will which is an attack on the
                        manhood</p>

                    <p>itself of the one hypnotized for will is the faculty of the spirit (spirit is
                        that which creates) and the Ego is the man. The methods used in all
                        pre-Christian times, when man had not reached his maturity so that he was
                        still under the guidance of Angelic beings were all dependent on this
                        dulling of consciousness and depression of the will and had to be carried
                        out with great care. They were used only in the mystery schools and with
                        specially chosen and developed individuals under the guidance of the
                        initiates. The underlying principle is like that of hypnotism and was
                        appropriate in those past preliminary civilizations, and the precautions
                        necessary were understood. They all entailed dulling of the normal
                        faculties.</p>
                    <p>The use of those methods today is harmful and often very seriously so and
                        serves no useful purpose. They belong to the past. They solve no problems.
                        We are familiar with them in various forms, Yogi, mediumship, spiritualism,
                        etc. However, the awakening and making use of the perceptive organs of the
                        Etheric body in full consciousness and with no dulling of any of our normal
                        faculties is urgently necessary at the present time. A new revolution in
                        thinking is as necessary in the Twentieth Century as that of the Nineteenth
                        Century was in its time.</p>
                    <p>The knowledge thus gained can be checked with the same precision as knowledge
                        through perception in the material realm and the problems of our time can
                        not be solved without this supplementary information which is appropriate to
                        this period of human evolution.</p>
                    <p>I have stood before an object and said to a fellow Anthroposophist, "Do you
                        see what I am seeing?" and she has responded by describing the appearance of
                        the ethers moving, rising, forming, changing tones, conforming exactly as
                        she spoke to what I was witnessing. In Australia, I have stood looking over
                        the valley and suddenly seen the cloudlike formation of the chemical ether
                        outlining with a wide band all the trees and shrubs, a phenomenon checked by
                        thousands of</p>

                        has become active. These things cannot be seen by the at present normal eye.
                        One not trained standing by does not see these things at all.</p>
                    <p>Indeed our own physical scientists have already transformed all the so-called
                        atoms into each other in the laboratories of our universities but they are
                        very shy about publicizing this fact. In California I asked a University
                        Professor to show me their atom smasher. He said, "Yes if you can call it an
                        atom."</p>
                    <p>Since with the coming of the Christ the first half of man's evolution, the
                        descent into matter, was completed, it is now our task to bring about the
                        ascent into spirit. With the Light (He was the Life and the Life was the
                        Light of man) now in man it becomes his task to carry on evolution, and the
                        Earth's evolution as well as his own becomes his task <note>"man's task"
                            typed over?</note> though the Christ will be with us till the end of the
                        Earth period. Since man is now mature enough to function as a responsible
                        being, since the period of faith has led on to the period of knowledge, the
                        Angels can no longer be permitted to guide men as they did in the past. He
                        must make his own decisions. Otherwise he could not carry on his evolution
                        as a free being. He can become fully cognizant of his nature only if the
                        consequences <note>"of" inserted in N-YHS</note> his deeds fall upon him. So
                        in the latter decades of the nineteenth century the Archangel Michael, who
                        in biblical times functioned as the Countenance of Jehovah, took over the
                        rulership of intelligence in the Cosmos. In a way he now functions as the
                        countenance of the Christ and he will not compromise. Now if human beings
                        want the assistance of the Angelic Beings they must come to them
                            <note>"him"?</note> for guidance out of their own free will; they must
                        use all their powers and faculties to solve their problems and then come to
                        Michael of their own free will and he will give them help.</p>
                    <pb n="396"/>

                    <p><note>Rudolf</note> Steiner tells us that there is the present chaos in World
                        Affairs because men will not recognize the Spiritual Beings. The Spiritual
                        Beings are not permitted to come to the aid of humanity unless and until men
                        recognize them, until they come to them for aid having used all their own
                        powers to solve their problems. And men today are not functioning helpfully
                        even in their thinking. Each kingdom is dependent for its sustenance on the
                        kingdoms below, the vegetable on the mineral and so on. The Angels are
                        dependent on man for their sustenance, on his significant thinking, and at
                        present they are starving.</p>
                    <p>Significant thinking we need that arouses the will and culminates in deeds.
                        Today they know not where to turn nor what to do. Each step now in material
                        science which was the hope of the 19th century but lowers the standards and
                        provokes man to greater and greater destruction. Unless material knowledge
                        is supplemented by that other help, spiritual <hi rend="ul">knowledge</hi>,
                        man's work cannot be constructive. Anthroposophy is applied Christianity,
                        Christianity applied to every side of life.</p>
                    <p>As Aristotle, a master of the knowledge of the period in which he lived,
                        established rational thinking and the foundations for all the knowledge
                        necessary for the period to follow <note>reading from N-YHS</note>, so with
                        Steiner who has laid the foundations for the knowledge necessary for the
                        period in which we live.</p>
                    <p>In ancient India, Religion, Art and Science were a true unity. In the time of
                        Egypt religion first appeared, religion as a separate thing. It became the
                        controlling factor of life. In the Greek period Art was separated out. It
                        became the dominating factor. Religion was expressed through Art. In our own
                        period Science has become the dominating factor and the gap between it and
                        religion and art has become ever greater. Out of this separation all three
                        have gone astray. Science has become dogma and functions through the Will
                        whereas it belongs in the thinking realm and should clean itself</p>

                    <p>of fanaticism, superstition, beliefs. It is religion that should function
                        through Will, deeds, and as a unit in a trinity dogma ceases to exist. Art
                        is functioning in the thinking realm. We find all sorts of thought out
                        tricks and devices taking the place of genius in Art where feeling should
                        rule. Religion has become nothing but the expression of feeling whereas its
                        realm is will, deeds. The task of this period of Evolution is to reunite the
                        three into a true unity, when they will again function in accordance with
                        their true nature. Thus can Christianity become a reality functioning in
                        every department of life. The Earth is a living Being and at present we are
                        killing it. With the Christ event the further evolution of man and the Earth
                        was placed in man's hands. The barometer itself proves that the earth is a
                        living breathing being for there is no other way of explaining the double
                        recording of high and low pressures of this instrument. What our time needs
                        is a little more confidence in facts and a bit less theorizing.</p>
                    <p>What then is the constitution of the Earth Being where the Christ now dwells.
                        To our physical senses there are 3 conditions. There are however 4 cause
                        forces in action and they create 4 conditions of matter. The primal ether
                        expresses itself in the condition of matter called warmth. This forms the
                        outer sphere of the earth. This information is but just confirmed through
                        aeronautics, the study of the stratosphere.</p>
                    <p>Scientists have said that as one goes out from the earth temperatures falls.
                        That has never been the case at night when the chemical ether is breathed
                        back into the earth but until recently no attention has been paid to that
                        fact. Now a student hears it spoken of as temperature reversal. But what
                        spiritual science has observed is now being corroborated by high fliers who
                        even in the daytime reach a level where the temperature begins to increase.
                        Physical scientists are likely to begin to the theorize and generalize about
                        that. Already I have seen an article by a scientist saying</p>
                    <pb n="398"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 398 ====]</p>
                    <p>that we'll probably have to give up our plans for flying to the moon because
                        we'd probably get fried before arriving. But the exact science of the
                        supersensible, never based on hypothesis but on perception, informs us that
                        when we go on from the earth's warmth ether realm though the warmth material
                        no longer exists, the ethers themselves exist in the reverse order.</p>
                    <p>This phenomenon of reversal, of turning inside out, expresses the basic
                        difference between the organic and the inorganic. That the Earth is an
                        organic being is again evidenced in another reversal as we go toward the
                        center.</p>
                    <p>It is of course impossible to enumerate the consequences of these facts. The
                        knowledge of them lays the foundation for a new and useful development of
                        all branches of science. The aim of living beings therefore should not be
                        perfection which entails something finished, fixed, dead. Instead their aim
                        should be growth, development. The great work of the physical scientist was
                        the establishing in the minds of modern men the fact of evolution. That
                        their conclusions were topsy turvy, that they followed always the straight
                        line of reason in the reverse direction from what really took place
                        concluding that man derived from the animal instead of the other kingdoms
                        from man does not alter the fact of the value of their contribution. They
                        arbitrarily limited their observations to what can be perceived by material
                        sense organs. We do not need to limit ourselves in any such way. The time
                        has come when the further advance of civilization hangs on our using all our
                        perceptive organs, physical and etheric.</p>

                        about the Sun. Now physical science here again tolerates in itself ideas in

                        earth. But scientists know that gas has no magnetic, no drawing power. Its
                        nature is outflying.</p>
                    <p>I told her that physically speaking the interior the Sun was a vacuum; it
                        contained no material substance. But it was filled with life ether. She
                        repeated this to her uncle, Professor <note>Henry L.?</note> Brose, who had
                        charge of the Rockefeller laboratory in Sydney and who had worked with
                        Rutherford and Einstein in Europe. He told her that was nonsense, if that
                        were the case everything would be falling into it. The burning ball
                        conception means that they consider the great radiations shown in
                        photographs to be flames reaching out from the Sun. Within 6 months news
                        came through that 2 young astronomers, in Kentucky I think, had for 2 years
                        been taking moving pictures of the Sun which revealed a movement inward to
                        the Sun. The life ether being the creative cause of solidity in which
                        gravity manifests is naturally attractive force itself. I myself at one time
                        had the impulse to concentrate my attention on the Sun and suddenly saw its
                        as one does in photographs, with the luminous radiations and the whole
                        interior sphere, or disc as I saw it, lilac, the life ether color, the color
                        I had seen rising from the seed.</p>
                    <p>These Sun forces act on the earth vertically, whereas the Moon forces act
                        horizontally as is checked by physical science which finds the magnetic
                        forces of the Moon at their maximum from the horizon. Physical science would
                        reasonably conclude that, like the Sun, it would have its maximum influence
                        from the Zenith. But this is contrary to fact. These polarities are
                        expressed in physical creatures in the typical horizontal backbone of the
                        animal versus the vertical backbone of man, hence their different types of
                        consciousness. One might say that the Sun is the Ruler of Plant and Man, the
                        Moon of the Animal.</p>
                    <p>As the Sun makes its diurnal path around the Earth and its a annual path from
                        north to south and back, corresponding movements</p>

                    <p>of the ethers take place from which we can learn something about what is
                        called the instincts of animals of which science can say nothing. It uses a
                        word and rests satisfied with that. In fact that is what all our thinkers
                        have been driven to - nominalism. They might as well answer every question
                        that arises with the - "Quien sabe?" of the Spanish. But today we must not
                        rest short of the answer to questions. Otherwise the chaos that we see on
                        our horizons will become world wide. Anthroposophy consists in the capacity
                        to ask questions and to recognize the answers when they come.</p>
                    <p>When the great seasonal migration of the birds takes place how does this come
                        about for we know that even the new season birds can take these great
                        journeys. How do they know the route is asked? But they don't know the
                        route. The seasonal movements of the Sun set flowing great and powerful
                        streams of the Ethers, the North and South currents. These the birds are
                        aware of and they follow the currents even fighting against heavy storms and
                        powerful air currents. I went to Cowes Island <note>Phillip Island?</note>
                        in Melbourne's harbor to witness the coming of the Mutton birds from the
                        South Pole continent in the spring. When the day arrived I was much
                        perturbed at the coolness of the hotel-keeper whose coach was to take us to
                        the particular point of the shore. I didn't want to miss the spectacle. But
                        he said afternoon would be soon enough. After lunch I pressed again for
                        starting. But he said if we started at half past two we would be in time. We
                        arrived at the appointed spot. No sign of birds and he said they wouldn't be
                        along for 20 minutes yet. In 20 minutes they came blackening the sky indeed
                        they came in such numbers. You see they had an even more accurate clock than
                        ours, the Sun itself, for their time-keeper.</p>
                    <p>So with the rise of the sap to the top of the trees. This is another
                        phenomenon on which science has given up guessing. Discussing? It isn't
                        done. For they know that the pressure of the</p>

                        effects this movement and carries it on, not only the diurnal movement but
                        the seasonal which for a time each year diminishes and increases this flow
                        of the sap.</p>

                            System to Simplify and Cheapen Building Construction<lb/> by Walter
                            Burley Griffin</bibl></p>
                    <p>EDITOR'S NOTE.- The writer of this article is best known as the architect who
                        planned the Federal Capital, built the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne, and
                        designed the garden suburb of Castlecrag, Sydney. But Mr. Griffin is also
                        keenly interested in the problem of small house construction, and in the
                        following columns he presents a brief description of what he has termed
                        segmental architecture. It is a system that employs building units of
                        special design, and its object is to reduce the cost of building houses -
                        particularly small homes - at the same time scorning monotony and providing
                        for an uncommon style of residence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">The Segmental System</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Segmental System is the outcome of ten years' effort to simplify the
                        complex processes of building now in vogue. It is realized that the
                        machine-made product must eventually supplant the hand-made in housing and
                        the Segmental System is a contribution toward that idea.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand no one wants to live in a "stereotype" house, and the idea
                        that first comes to mind when we think of machine made is monotonous
                        repetition.</p>
                    <p>Where concrete houses are cast monolithic in form, economy demands a high
                        degree of uniformity; likewise the large slab units that have been in use
                        put severe restrictions on variation.</p>
                    <p>Now elaborateness obtained at the cost of endless repetition would be still
                        more distressing even than the barnlike plainness to which the older methods
                        of building in brick or stone or timber have accustomed us.</p>
                    <p>In the case of inexpensive small houses that is the only alternative because
                        every projection or corner or opening or other departure from the square box
                        economic ideal is an expensive luxury in labor costs</p>

                    <p>that do not provide any additional room.</p>
                    <p>But Segmental Construction is not designed as a substitute for timber, brick
                        or stone, artificial or natural, or concrete plain or reinforced, nor for
                        any other substance in its usual and proper uses. If one wants to have his
                        house of the types suitable to any of these or within their limitations for
                        the amount he has to spend, then he can dispense with the segmental system.</p>
                    <p>Segmental Construction, however, by eliminating the extra cost of outside
                        walls, of wings, angles and bays and buttresses, of openings for doors and
                        windows, and cupboards, through eliminating cutting and fitting and plumbing
                        and aligning, makes possible the convenience and beauty and infinite variety
                        of such features within the limits of expense of our commonplace boxes or
                        more or less dark cells which we have been driven to by sheer necessity. The
                        ordinary types have to struggle to attract interest by such devices as
                        varying the front covering with clinker or blue bricks, or spatterdash
                        stucco, or by alternating hip and gable roofs or departing from the shape of
                        the "classic" veranda pillars to bulbs or pyramids, or by attaching
                        "gew-gaws" to entrances or window frames, or fancy, but non-transparent,
                        "lead-lights" in the sashes.</p>
                    <p>Technically there are only two types of segments - vertebral, which lock
                        together to make the framework or skeleton, and tesseral, which lock
                        together for two-ply curtain walls, attaching to and stretching between the
                        vertebral columns.</p>
                    <p>The double wall provides for lap joints everywhere, and between the inner and
                        outer layers there is an insulation layer of bitumen or aquella, as well as
                        a proportion of air ducts in the interlocking keys, which allow for cooling
                        by convection where the exposure requires it. In these flutes also are
                        concealed gas and electric conductors.</p>
                    <p>In erection, the segments are simply slipped together from above.</p>
                    <pb n="406"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 406 ====]</p>
                    <p>With the manufactured half segments all the openings and corners work out
                        accurately so that, without cutting or fitting, the grooved frames of the
                        doorways and windows and fixtures are likewise slid into place and made fast
                        with grouting, with all the essential fittings thus inserted true to fixed
                        standard dimensions, they can be completely prepared and coated in the shop,
                        and their essential parts are carried in stock, much quickening the building
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>The unit of dimension in each direction is six inches which leaves ample
                        variety of size and shape for all the features of the house.</p>
                    <p>Internal surface consists of six-inch squares with all the possibilities open
                        to tile work for panels or pattern decoration, in colors or ornament applied
                        in stencil or imprint.</p>
                    <p>Externally the segments appear mainly as twelve inch chequers with
                        tuck-pointed joints, the effect at Castlecrag being cut stone, the colors
                        being supplied by the sands selected for the surface - white, purple, pink,
                        yellow and yellowish green.</p>
                    <p>Almost unlimited modeling of the masses is rendered practicable by the
                        lightness and stiffness of the construction which spans openings without
                        lintel members, and projects without extra supports to form balconies,
                        oriels and turrets. Buttresses, pylons and crenellations are almost
                        inevitable features, and the uniform supporting power of interior and
                        exterior walls invited the introduction of courts or the breaking up of the
                        mass of even the smallest house into terraces or tower rooms.</p>
                    <p>Such freedom to deal with the general proportions, making an articulate pile
                        out of the smallest type of building, is the great characteristic of
                        Segmental Architecture. And this opportunity is, of course, the fundamental
                        of all architectural design; the basis for real diversity, with neither
                        superfluous nor arbitrary factors.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>Imitation of Walter Burley Griffin Knitlock without its structural features.</p>
                    <p>This architect was visited by Mr. <note>George A.</note> Taylor who after
                        calling me into his office in the early days in Australia to inform me that
                        Mr. Griffin was to do as he told him (which of course he never did) and who
                        spent an amazing amount of time vilifying Griffin even going to the Prime
                        Minister Mr. <note>William Morris</note> Hughes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hughes was not so easily handled however and simply handed over Taylor's
                        papers to Mr. Griffin.</p>
                    <p>Largely impelled by his venom he visited the United States and called on
                        various architects who gave him much material for his magazine. Wright did
                        not give him any but he listened to the knitlock story and shortly after
                        built this structure in California. He was always quick on the uptake. This
                        however except in superficial appearance has not structural resemblance to
                        knitlock and no structural value. He also followed the hint Taylor gave him
                        about floors solid on the ground and used the idea but with no structural
                        basis, which of course Taylor couldn't give him, so of course the water
                        poured in and the floor had to <note>be?</note> supplemented with another.
                        Griffin's method of construction was not grasped. Griffin laid an asphalt
                        layer under the whole house with 2" x 4" strips cut in two with the narrow
                        edge upward <note>and?</note> laid it in flush with the top so that when the
                        floorboards were nailed to these strips there was no air space below so no
                        chance of rot.</p>
                    <p>Griffin also solved the problem of leaky roofs in Australia where with their
                        horizontal driving storms the Marseilles tile was no good. His is a concrete
                        tile set diagonally.</p>

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>In this schematic plan Chicago's fine radial railroad system with its
                        connecting belt lines has been co-ordinated with motor speedways to enable
                        an orderly development of 6 municipal centers indicated by double ovals
                        which relieve the pressure on the main urban business center on the lake.</p>
                    <p>Each of these is placed where several railroad routes come together all being
                        below the surface level.</p>
                    <p>The Metropolitan air field was shown in the lake which idea has now been
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>Each of the municipal plazas has a surface Air Landing field to supplement
                        the underground railroad station giving rise to a natural municipal center
                        so that the practical needs of the outlying districts are met minimizing the
                        excessive crowding of the metropolitan center. Sydney, Australia is an
                        example of such a grouping of metropolis and surrounding municipalities
                        which are independent politically as well as officially. The arrangement
                        works well.</p>

                        we have accepted with but slight modifications its system of major
                        thoroughfares, railroads or other types, modifying their widths and
                        construction, depressing the high-speed railways and at many intersection
                        points flooring the railroads over, as also the rail-road yards, so that no
                        occupation space for structures or air-planes is lost as in Mr. James
                        Alexander Smith's suggested Melbourne railroad center. <note>See

                        routine form. Their development and individually should become a matter of
                        local pride and rivalry - crystallizing in widely different and beautiful
                        forms. (See Community Center - Leeton, Australia). These rail-road yards
                        floored over could be used as local Air Ports also which on the whole are

                    <p>This is but one of several buildings in which Griffin used the stepped motive
                        carried above the roof. The first one was an alternative design he offered
                        to his clients in 1914 when the Capitol Theatre was on the boards raked over
                        the coals by his clients' representatives.</p>
                    <p>His silent partner then persuaded the clients to accept the first design and
                        shortly afterward built a ten story building to the stepped design.</p>
                    <p>It has evidently impressed itself on the ethers for it has appeared in
                        various connections all over the world. It appeared impressively used in the
                        Russian Building in The New York Exposition <note>New York World's Fair
                            1939-1940</note>. The most beautiful example I have seen was in Madras,
                        India under construction in 1937.</p>

                        should be no speedways, no short cuts, no wide streets. On the other hand
                        there should be no stub end streets but direct access, for everyone within,
                        to the business circumference - shops, movies, etc. The whole will be safe.
                        Children can go to the interior schools or to the circumferential shops

                        and the carrying of none through will accomplish these and many other

                    <p>The solution of community problems is simple - not like a line but like a
                        circle or a triangle. Just as the solution of Town Planning lies in separate
                        but simultaneous attack of the problems of Communication and Occupation,
                        plus the mathematical special requirement of eliminating acute angles, and
                        the spiritual requirement of conserving nature, so with the administrative
                        problem. It has three elements - Political - Economic - Social. This has now
                        been recognized in the organization of the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>Therefore our first question, the urgent issue of the present moment is:-</p>
                    <p>1st - Which one of the present forms of government most facilitates universal
                        employment with the greatest returns to the individuals and the least menace
                        to the development of human individuality.</p>
                    <p>2nd - What changes in organization should be made in this best form? This is
                        urgent for there seems to be a subterranean influence working for the
                        perpetuation of the worst of all forms of government since all kinds of
                        tyranny can screen themselves behind it - the Parliamentary form, the froth
                        of which comes up even in our Universities in America. It took a war of
                        revolution for the United States to free itself from that form. It is dust
                        in the eye to say that it was a king from which we were escaping. It is the
                        most urgent question in the reconstruction of the world at the close of the
                        war. The writers of the American Constitution knew the evils of the
                        Parliamentary System of their own experience. This menace is far greater
                        than that of Communism for the latter is openly controlled by the
                        bureaucracy whereas the parliamentary form is just as completely controlled
                        but so cleverly that no one seems to be aware of it. But the consequences
                        are there and can be measured by a comparison of the welfare of the people
                        of Europe and America.</p>

                    <p>It is urgent also since now the Oriental peoples "whose numbers reach the
                        billion mark" are quite equal to the Occidentals "whose number is but a few
                        million" in intellectual, scientific and mechanical ability. The recent war
                        has thoroughly awakened them to the issues of EMPLOYMENT. They are ripe for
                        reorganization.</p>
                    <p>Experience of life under each form, the Congressional and the Parliamentary,
                        makes clear the radical difference between the two which is understood by
                        almost no one, yet is the chief issue today as it was in the 1st World War.
                        It is the basic issue of employment since it is the issue between
                        concentrated Power and Democracy.</p>
                    <p>Only under the Congressional form of government do the people have the
                        opportunity, if they chose to use it, of selecting their executive. The
                        electoral system <note>US Electoral College?</note>, a hang-over from the
                        past, should be ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in
                        the reach of the masses of the people.</p>
                    <p>Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes, the bureaucracy,
                        can determine the executive from the start or at any time after the election
                        by throwing out the elected party whenever it wants to which gives it a
                        powerful influence over members even without overthrowing the party. They
                        vote as they are told to vote or out they go, and the whole complicated and
                        expensive business of election has to be gone through again. No wonder the
                        people are dejected. Naturally the more businesses that are put in the hands
                        of the government the easier it is for the officials to control everything
                        so socialism moves swiftly to communism which is simply perfected - call it
                        what you will - communism or imperialism.</p>
                    <p>This means that after this war Americans should use every possible means to
                        direct the reorganization of Europe toward the congressional form, and the
                        basic principle laid down as EQUITY.</p>

                    <p>Nowhere but in the United States (among the major communities) is this the
                        intention of government. The next step should be to eliminate the power of
                        granting monopolies from the political province. Whatever is done in this
                        field should be by the Abilities Organ (the social organ), the Political -
                        the central organ - would have the task and the power to prevent inequity.</p>
                    <note>Text similar to that above can be found in Section II, No. 12., page
                        175ff.</note>
                    <p>ABILITIES ORGAN - With local groups, somewhat of the nature of parents and
                        teachers organizations, interorganized to meet various other than
                        educational needs purposes could be effected which would center neither on
                        making warriors nor serfs out of the mass of the people. Capacities could be
                        highly developed and efficiency enormously increased and the whole field of
                        education broadened and extended. Education would be provided throughout the
                        lifetime of the citizenry so that any changes in employment, due to
                        invention or other factors, could be provided for by open opportunities for
                        education in all fields throughout a man's life instead of his being thrown
                        out of work and reduced to lower standards of living.</p>
                    <p>Having recognized that in the Political Realm the idea of Equity is the
                        opposite of Welfare which but leads to war since it rests on the idea that
                        might is right and that conquering a country is a benefit to the common
                        people of the conquering community, we look at the realm of ECONOMICS.</p>
                    <p>ECONOMICS - Having recognized the Community's obligation to provide the
                        opportunities for every man to develop his own abilities in his own way, we
                        turn our attention to the Economic Organization of the community which has
                        to function in a totally different realm to meet the bodily needs of men. In
                        this everyone in the community is concerned either as producer or consumer,
                        as manager or worker, agriculturist or technician. It is essentially
                        international.</p>

                    <p>2nd - To facilitate safe and secure human intercourse.</p>

                        domicile with humanizing contact and interplay between human beings, and
                        between human beings and nature. Only so can we get rid of delinquency and
                        crime and disease.</p>
                    <p>At present each block is a war zone. Children prevented, for safety, from
                        crossing the streets are considered enemies if they do cross and the battle
                        is on. We must make communication adequate and safe. All, even children,
                        must have close access to the requirements of daily life yet that access
                        must be safe as well as the access to education and sport.</p>
                    <p>Since Chicago is an existing city we have, on the whole, accepted its
                        diagonals. Except for their own intersections, the acute angles, so wasteful
                        of space and so objectionable in construction, have been eliminated. In
                        minor streets coming into the radials, when a geometric plan takes the place
                        of the gridiron, these can easily be eliminated. Each quarter section has
                        half its streets lined with the cardinal points of the compass and half with
                        the intermediate compass points so the perpendiculars can easily be

                        made and canals used for industry. These levels could be maintained in the

                        industrializing Lake Calumet we have used it, by the same method of holding
                        back the run off of its water for a charming residential community - a New
                        Venice. There is ample space to the west of Chicago for industrial
                        development, advantageous to Chicago if properly planned. Chicago could
                        properly and profitably extend as far west of its ENTRANCE GATE as it has to
                        the North and South.</p>

                    <p>Chicago has an unusually complete system of Railroads, appropriate to its
                        central location on the continent, and of diagonal avenues. We have made no
                        distinction between these except in the matter of the time of construction.
                        The building lines on them all should be 200 feet apart that they may be
                        ready for the introduction of depressed central rail lines in the future
                        when required. In the mean time, on the whole, only the 8 rail Through
                        Express routes call for the use of all that width for vehicular traffic. All
                        these thoroughfares should be treed and gardened ways. The evaporation
                        serves as a very noticeable cooler on hot days.</p>
                    <p>On the whole the radial routes, varying in the weight of their service, have
                        been retained. In only a few places have they been removed. Sometimes there
                        has been a slight deviation here and there to bring together unnecessarily
                        close lines thus simplifying the problem of satisfactory occupation. A
                        surprisingly large area of Chicago is unoccupied. Land value taxation would
                        put an end to that. We assume that all the latest improvements will be made
                        use of.</p>
                    <p>Instead of the present type of steam, or even perhaps of Diesel engines there
                        will be single rail lines with trains suspended while in motion between the
                        wire above and the rail below for we have recently awakened to the advantage
                        of Tom Johnson's invention</p>
                    <note>Tom L. Johnson (1854-1911) was a Progressive politician (mayor of
                        Cleveland), businessman (investor in street railways), and inventor (a

                    <p>perfected a quarter of a century ago. In competition with air service the
                        surface, or rather depressed service of Railroads will have to be
                        modernized. At crossings one express should go deeper - under the other.</p>
                    <p>A city is immortal. All these changes need not therefore entail heavy
                        expenditures but can come with the timely and natural restoration of the
                        properties involved. The external roads of the quarter and half sections
                        will be fast traffic but local rather than express so generally the present
                        widths are sufficient. Passenger traffic here should be buses which can pick
                        up the passengers at the curb minimizing danger. There may be exceptions to
                        this where new 200' thoroughfares will be used. The freight trucks should be
                        so constructed that they can be switched onto Rail lines thus minimizing the
                        crowding of streets. The problem of the safety of surface traffic at
                        intersections of thoroughfares has been worked out in Chicago and is being
                        established by either center circulating parks or over and under ways.</p>
                    <p>INTERIOR - Segregation of Occupation and Communication divides communication
                        into exterior and interior. The Neighborhood streets, the opposite of
                        thoroughfares, should be narrow and devious though this does not mean
                        indirect. No stub ends and no curly streets. Their use will be purely for
                        domestic service - some 18' and others 25' wide.</p>
                    <p>This narrowing of pavements - for the building lines can be set at a width of
                        50 or more feet - and the elimination of all alleys, except the one back of
                        the shops on the Section lines, on the circumference of the Neighborhoods,
                        will mean that this system of occupation will entail no extra cost but be a
                        saving to the community.</p>

                    <p>The Elevated roads should gradually be eliminated. Subways are called for
                        only in the main Retail and Office centers North, and later South, of the
                        Cultural and Administrative Center and in Community Centers.</p>
                    <p>Irregular spaces along the through routes will supplement the Industrial and
                        Manufacturing spaces or be used for flats.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In accordance with the general principle or locating Community Centers, this
                        center of Metropolitan Chicago is placed where all 8 of the Through Routes
                        come together. Its location has been indicated diagrammatically. It lies
                        between Halstead <note>Halsted Street?</note> and the Lake and between
                        Roosevelt Road and 26th Street. Into these 8 routes pour all the railroad
                        main and branch and belt lines. One can reach it directly from anywhere.
                        Within this district all the Railroads and Stations will be below grade and
                        completely floored over. (In Sydney the Railroads of the whole metropolis
                        are underground, very elegant and offering enough safe and comfortable space
                        to house close to the whole population of the city in time of war.)</p>
                    <p>This is not a terminal station. All lines are through routes. It is about the
                        center between the North and South limits of Chicago. The South Side, since
                        through it pours a stream from the intensely occupied Eastern States, bids
                        fair soon to become as important as the North Side. It requires only proper
                        handling within and beyond the City limits to become so. We therefore
                        suggest the expectation of a Retail Trade and Office development district to
                        the South comparable to that to the North especially as this South East
                        region continues to have the Lake Shore. The State line boundary line
                            <note>i.e., between Illinois and Indiana</note> means nothing.</p>
                    <p>Three Routes come in from the South. The other Through Routes come in from
                        the West and North. Trade and Office building may naturally extend Northward
                        in this district beyond the River. Beyond the area to the North of the mouth
                        of the River along the Lake Shore is, and may well continue to be, the tall
                        flat building district with a more or less transient occupancy. A similar</p>

                        The significance of State lines will gradually disappear as the State has no
                        real function. It is merely a left-over from pre-revolutionary times.</p>
                    <p>In the United States, as in the world, all purely artificial boundaries
                        should be broken down. The three natural divisions are the <hi rend="ul"
                            >world</hi>, the <hi rend="ul">Continent</hi> and the <hi rend="ul"
                        >City</hi>. A difference between races really no longer exists. As people go
                        to the Tropics they become dark, in the Temperate zones they become fair and
                        today the individual recognizes no boundary lines. Indeed America's especial
                        task in the coming decades is to migrate to all parts of the world carrying
                        along the concept of democracy whose foundation stone is <hi rend="ul"
                            >Equity</hi>. A democracy is a community organization whose function,
                        and only function, is to maintain EQUITY. A separate organization of the
                        same people is necessary to maintain FRATERNITY (mutuality), that is an
                        economic organization, and still another to maintain LIBERTY a social
                        organization financed by land taxation to supply education through man's
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The meeting point of Land, Water and Air transport, if properly handled,
                        should establish a spectacular Architectural Center - a true Urban Cultural
                        Center. A deviation of the river could take freight traffic west of this
                        center. This natural Center offers the opportunity for a beautiful
                        expression of the genius of the City as the representative of the present
                        civilization. The construction of this center should not be too hurried. The
                        Field Museum and the Planetarium are already there. The drawings of
                        buildings presented in THE MAGIC OF AMERICA but suggest the variety and
                        range that could make this center of Metropolitan and State and Federal
                        government's executive, administrative and judicial functions a superbly
                        beautiful Center with a background of tall buildings.</p>

                    <p>Here, creating a new course for the Chicago River, we have a lock system to
                        form a series of formal reflecting pools of controlled waters for garden and
                        architectural effects. Every location and approach would have to be studied
                        individually along with its surroundings. We do not suggest following any
                        ancient civilization's forms but the using of America's creative genius
                        whose fire was lighted by the founder of modern Architecture - Louis
                        Sullivan. Broad ways with Terminal accents, Theatres, Opera House,
                        Libraries, Museums, Galleries, Institutions, should gradually be established

                        with trees and so forth properly labeled. Elsewhere, Australia for instance,
                        the great cities have magnificent Botanical Gardens in the very heart of the

                    <p>Chicago as a whole is a community which contains within it other communities.
                        We discuss this as a present and future problem. The present retail and
                        office building district lies to the North of the proposed Entrance Gate
                        extending west from the Lake and tending to go beyond the River. The
                        original difficulties of the site have been overcome and its location at the
                        confluence of the river with the lake is properly the determining factor of
                        its location.</p>
                    <p>This Central City, free from radial lines is a natural Retail and Office
                        Building Center. Provision is made for the extension of this central
                        down-town area by extending it Westward to Halstead <note>Halsted</note>
                        Street. Its business is improved by the intense flat district to the North
                        and the Entrance Gate on its Southern Boundary and the bringing of all
                        Through Routes to this Center which is not a terminal station. Much use will
                        be made of the underground of all this district. The present terminal
                        stations will remain but as local stops.</p>
                    <p>We suggest nothing revolutionary for Chicago's business center. As time goes
                        on, multiple buildings will be replaced by single buildings occupying a
                        whole block, with interior courts, etc., and they will tend not to become
                        higher but to become monumental and beautiful. Open squares will be left so
                        that the surrounding buildings may be seen to advantage. Such spaces cost
                        nothing when held by the community. Through this district the river flows
                        and the property adjacent to it will be held by the community and gradually
                        the river will be parked <note>developed into parks?</note> on either side

                    <p>space enough to see the buildings to advantage.</p>
                    <p>The River within this central city should be entirely freed from anything
                        that would hamper its stateliness and beauty. It would be well to set
                        immediately the building line boundaries on either side of the river to
                        ensure a park along both its sides from 25th Street to its mouth. Rentals
                        cost the city nothing as they belong to the community as a whole. Where
                        there are monumental buildings these could be allowed to remain.</p>
                    <p>To the South we forecast a similar Retail and Office Building area developing
                        gradually from the Entrance Gate. Such a district might develop in the two
                        sections (about a mile southward by two miles from East to West) to the
                        South though they have been drawn as ordinary residential districts.</p>
                    <p>Three of the Express Through Routes (No.1, No.2, and No.3) carry from the
                        South and the Southwest districts through this district into the
                        Administrative Center and the Retail Trade and Office District to the North.
                        The South Side, if properly handled would have a population as profitable to
                        Chicago as the North districts beyond the City limits are. We begin that by
                        making Lake Calumet a New Venice.</p>
                    <p>The intensely occupied flat district along the Lake to the North can be left
                        as it is on the whole. It will be occupied by transients or elderly people.
                        Families with children or young folk will move into the neighboring
                        districts where life can be full of interest. Apartments will also appear in
                        the spaces adjacent to thoroughfares.</p>
                    <p>Bit by bit we are breaking away from imitative architecture and designing
                        with a free hand which can be beautiful and interesting and worthy of a bit
                        of speciousness for a soul developing influence. The industrial buildings

                        the citizenry can easily reach any of the outlying districts. The River

                    </p>
                    <p>Industry from early days took possession of Chicago. It made and it will
                        destroy it if allowed to be the controlling factor. Chicago should be a
                        London only <hi rend="ul">modern</hi>. London is made up of many separate
                        municipalities. If Chicago's extension into the lake East of the mouth of
                        the Calumet River (which perhaps Nature's piling up of the sands might make
                        possible) is not feasible at least pains should be taken there to form an
                        enclosed harbor whose outer shore should be park and pleasure ground for the
                        citizens, restoring to them what industry has destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Chicago is a natural Industrial and Commercial Center. Whether it is living
                        or dying depends upon its citizenry first and the transients secondarily.
                        The beautiful lake district South and Southeast will attract as high class a
                        citizenry as have the beauties of the North Shore and should not be
                        despoiled. There is plenty of room to the west for expending industry but
                        its expression calls for pre-planning. We take for granted that Chicago will
                        presently do as other places have done and prevent industry from polluting
                        either the air or the water. All its by-products can be made use of even the
                        heat which can be used as in Oak Park <note>Illinois</note> for community
                        hot water systems.</p>
                    <p>A FAIRLY GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRIES IS DESIRABLE as it affords
                        employment to a considerable proportion of the population who should
                        therefore live as close as possible, and whose standards can and should be
                        as high as anyone's and whose home environment and opportunities for the
                        children should be on a level with any other citizen's. This has been the
                        natural cause of Chicago's growth so we find industry scattered throughout
                        the Metropolis, and on the whole we have left that as it is as we have also
                        that of the radial transport system.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 458 ====]</p>
                    <p>There is endless opportunity for extension of industry to the West. It is no
                        more important to Chicago that it should be within the municipal limits than
                        that the North Shore residential districts should be. What is necessary is
                        that it should be pre-planned, each and every square mile. Each district may
                        be a particular problem. The successful planning of each district will
                        contribute to Chicago's development as a continental center.</p>
                    <p>The great work of the young people of the 1st decades of the 20th century
                        gave Chicago a magnificent outer park system of reserves. But this has met
                        but the one necessity of preserving nature within the community boundaries.
                        It was done with no town-planning system except the rescue of as many lovely
                        spots as possible. Its work extended over the State and even beyond. In a
                        way it was outside the realm of Town Planning as we have defined it - i.e.,
                        the problem of occupation and communication. Its motive was simply "to the
                        rescue" of Mother Nature. That must be followed by district planning.</p>
                    <p>The waterways can be kept pure, as can the air, by Imhoff tank <note>a kind
                            of septic tank</note> systems, incinerators, etc., which can be used on
                        any scale from the single house to communities as a whole in which case the
                        buildings housing such functions can be monumental structures, an honor to
                        any neighborhood and no menace. (See illustrations of incinerators.)</p>
                    <p>The manufacturing districts would naturally, and may properly, follow the
                        through routes. This again gives easy access of their employees to them and
                        to the domestic Centers. The irregular spaces caused by not having
                        preplanned the Through Routes could well be used for such purposes and for
                        tall flats. Manufacturing could also use some of the minor distributive
                        thoroughfares depending on its nature.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the suggestion of one of the world's great engineers, Mr.
                        James Alexander Smith, who suggested for Melbourne <note>Australia</note>
                        (where all Railroads come into one station, the only one, with the great
                        railroads adjacent) the erection of buildings over them in the heart of the
                        City District, we are suggesting such treatment at the various intersections
                        of Chicago's complicated Railroad System.</p>
                    <p>The Central District is supplemented by the Community Centers the underground
                        space of which along with that of the Community Air Ports can provide areas
                        for railroad yards, community garages, etc., as well as temporary parking
                        space for shoppers, etc. - those things which do not need sunshine and where
                        artificial light and ventilation, etc., suffice. These Community Centers are
                        located from one to three miles apart throughout the Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>All the Major and minor thoroughfares from the quarter-section circumferences
                        to the Express Rail Routes (smokeless) will be business and flat districts
                        which with an organic plan, will inevitably locate such elements, the
                        business naturally starting from through route intersections major and
                        minor.</p>
                    <p>The through routes have been the only thing that has defied rectangles but
                        they have neglected the occupation requirements. So between the two (surveys
                        and transportation) our communities - well, as the old man said, "Confuse is
                        Hell and my wife is all confuse" - our communities are ..... all confuse.

                    <p>CAPTION</p>
                    <p>This great central domed hall in Melbourne is a unique type of construction.
                        I believe there is one such in India. Strictly speaking it is not a dome.
                        The structure is a series of great circular intersecting arches which
                        eliminate the dome type of strains. At their lower contact point Griffin
                        placed the highly ornamental torches, making all the lighting indirect. So
                        effective was it that the oculist member of the board of directors could no
                        longer complain when he found that he could read the tiniest print on his
                        eye testing chart.</p>
                    <p>The coloring of the walls and arches of this hall is wonderful. The rough
                        surface of the intersections add richness, and the varied pattern of the
                        intersecting arches which could be colored in different shades of gold and
                        orange and green.</p>
                    <p>The design of the whole is a unique thing in the world and though by no means
                        Gothic holds its own with the beautiful structures of Europe.</p>

                        their rational faculty) who must <hi rend="ul">tackle their</hi> problem or
                        the answer will be delinquency, crime, disease, degeneration. We must
                        recognize the consequences and responsibilities which arise from the
                        division of labor.</p>
                    <p>In Chicago which really has a superb system of radial, branch and belt
                        Railroads, we have accepted on the whole the through routes. The
                        intersection points determine the proper location for Community Centers. On
                        the whole we have chosen those at two or three mile intervals where a Center
                        one mile long will include two or more different through route intersection
                        points. Within this area not only will the tracks go underground but the
                        stations as well. The fact of locating these natural places for concentrated
                        service will develop a rivalry that will tend to make them all beautiful.
                        The Community's collecting of rental values will prevent the holding back of
                        development. The neglect of this in early days was the cause of the
                        perversion of <note>Pierre-Charles</note> L'Enfant's plan of Washington
                        which sent the development of business where it was not intended.</p>
                    <p>These Centers can combine, with business, other functions of general
                        community interest as Civic Buildings, Libraries, Memorials, Aquaria,
                        Museums, etc. The form used is but to indicate the location. Individual
                        initiative as well as local use of Town Planning advice will lead to
                        interesting variety in the solutions of these problems, as it would in
                        suburban and outlying communities, as the importance of preplanning becomes
                        understood. Main thoroughfares radiate from these Community Centers.</p>

                    <p>disastrous consequences of canals in draining swiftly the waters in nature's
                        reservoirs to pour their seasonal waters into the streams below causing loss
                        of life and much other damage. Such natural features should be dealt with by
                        humans, but not to desecrate as is being suggested for Calumet, but to use
                        in beauty, for Nature rejoices in being in partnership with man, but if
                        desecrated She destroys him, if not by violence then by disease. Work with
                        Nature and She grants genius.</p>
                    <p>In Calumet there is ample water. It should be conserved. Space can also be
                        conserved by using flat roofs entirely. They can be used for gardens only,
                        which keep the buildings cool in summer, or for garage or other services.
                        The development has been suggested diagrammatically though quite possibly it
                        may be the best way since wriggly roads on flat land are intolerable. On the
                        main radials, business etc. will develop as on the Quarter Section lines.
                        Within them will be purely domestic roads and canals. In the Center the

                    <p>Town Planning and Architecture are inseparable even down to the case of the
                        private house on a single lot. Whether it should be low lying and set back
                        or lifted up with ground floor instead of basement depends on its adjoining
                        neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Architecture is one half of the problem but in Chicago only the problem of
                        communication has been tackled and only half of that - the major
                        communication lines. No consideration has been given to what should be done
                        for interior distributive lines. The consequence is that except for the
                        retail trade and office districts and the occasional large parks, Chicago is
                        completely slums.</p>
                    <p>Our problem is to get the correct answer which can be attained only by
                        combining mathematics and art. In nature we have an illustration in the
                        triangle or hexagon - the snowflake with its myriad enchanting forms. What
                        the adult is depends on what the child has been. Only in proper wholesome
                        surroundings can one grow up complete, healthy, happy - fully developed in
                        body, soul and spirit. All other issues are secondary. Only if the problem
                        of occupancy is solved can the coming generation grow up healthy, wealthy
                        and wise.</p>
                    <p>Since Chicago is an established city we approach the problem so. We find that
                        all the streets are thoroughfares. No consideration has been given to
                        occupation except in the location of various isolated parks. These are right
                        and fine but do not in the least meet the needs of small children and their
                        parents for daily and hourly use for the thousand and one purposes that the
                        prisons of house and school cannot offer.</p>
                    <p>In communication we must consider topography. Its basic requirement is
                        directness but this must be considered with topography which it must not
                        defy. In occupation in the residential</p>
                    <pb n="466"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 466 ====]</p>
                    <p>districts the basic factors are accessibility, safety and seclusion. So no
                        solution can be universal. Each particular part must be given individual
                        attention; to both these problems the preservation of nature is basic.</p>
                    <p>It is of first importance that we should eliminate delinquency. The children
                        should be safe and have wide contact with others while growing up to be
                        complete and satisfied human beings. In Chicago no attention has been given
                        to this half of the community problem. The issue is not centralizing or
                        decentralizing. Even intensely occupied areas may be safe but all the other
                        requirements should be met too. Even if our domestic units should be crowded
                        (which we should not permit) they still would be safe for the domestic
                        functions of children and parents.</p>
                    <p>The type pattern set for Quarter and Half Sections sometimes conform to
                        present quarter-section lines and sometimes are set diagonal to them. In
                        each case this could be determined by investigation of the particular
                        district. In all cases the present Quarter Section lines could be retained
                        if it was found to be important to do so. In no case need the changes within
                        the Quarter Section lines be revolutionary. We can do as they have done in
                        Metropolitan Sydney to get rid of the hopeless confusion of traffic on its
                        narrow streets. There a new building line has been set. When a new building
                        is erected it must conform to the new line. This entails no extra expense
                        and really gives added style to the new buildings, attracting attention and
                        custom. Or we could do as was done several times in Los Angeles - move
                        buildings on to new lots.</p>
                    <p>The ultimate building lines could be set and when present owners decided to
                        rebuild they could be allocated a new lot on the plan as determined. In many
                        cases about half of the streets would remain where they are at present, just
                        their width and treatment would be</p>

                        window. The garage piers serve as huge lanterns serving to illuminate the
                        garden and paths. Flower boxes put an artistic touch to these unique

                        some of the Half Sections where the treatment is shown to be on an ampler
                        scale. Consideration of each district would determine whether the quarter or
                        half section would be used. If, as is sometimes suggested, the interior
                        streets within the Quarter Section are placed closer together and the back
                        yard space eliminated and perhaps one common park substituted, this does not
                        meet the requirements for plan and congregation space. A quarter section
                        with practically no parks, or one or two parks and with round about access
                        to commercial streets is but going from bad to worse and would make hopeless
                        slums.</p>
                    <p>In this general study the present location of important buildings has been
                        given no consideration. This can be taken care of just as the present parks
                        have been cared for within the special Quarter Section in which they occur.
                        In bringing order out of the present confusion each detail would be given
                        careful consideration. No scheme should be used <note>"given" typed

                        considered Cemeteries as valuable open spaces which ultimately will become
                        accessible gardens, each with a memorial building with tablets of those
                        buried there. With ample access to nature and ample provision for sports the
                        necessity for tubercular institutes, etc., would disappear.</p>
                    <p>Intermediate spaces between Quarter Sections and Through Routes could be used
                        for such group requirements as Universities. We count on a continual great
                        increase in the number of people going through the Universities. The
                        scientific nature of our civilization calls for this and provision should be
                        made for the use of these institutions throughout a man's life. Science and
                        Culture should go hand in hand and could do so in a properly planned

                        parents. The seclusion and safety of the interior of the Quarter Sections
                        make these things possible. Isolation of children in their homes destroys
                        the broadening of their souls and genius. The crowding of them together in
                        the drill chambers of huge schoolrooms destroys their originality. There

                    <p>Any scheme of development that is to serve during a considerable period of
                        time must first be "elastic" to accommodate as many contingencies as can be
                        predicted. But a development that is to suit the simplest requirements of
                        modern community life can be neither amorphous nor arbitrary nor with
                        autocratic restrictions. Its elastic adaptability will not be secure unless
                        founded on a simple articulation of functions with careful attention to
                        distinctions that are fundamental and specific, and to correlation that may
                        be considered of vital organic necessity - generic.</p>
                    <p>To arrive at these relationships it is necessary not only to study present
                        civic conditions - failures as well as successes - but to trace their
                        historical development from our earliest knowledge to ascertain tendencies
                        that may be expected to affect the future. Thus only can we hope to deal
                        broadly in generalization without running into mere speculation unrelated to
                        reality.</p>
                    <p>The method of this project follows an assumed primary distinction between the
                        needs of suitable site conditions for individual or specialized Occupancy on
                        the one hand and those of social and general Communication on the other.
                        Co-operative industrial site requirements are reciprocal with the most
                        general accommodation and family social and private requirements.</p>

                        structural significance of the scheme and, in practice, eliminate many
                        non-essential though important variations that would have to be considered

                    <p>The general tendency of most of Chicago implies, for the Quarter Section,
                        adaptation to predominantly residential function. There is, however, an
                        important modification of the normal considered here as an alternative. This
                        involves a development in connection with a manufacturing concern to provide
                        home and social advantages primarily for the employees of the contiguous
                        works. The most typical additional assumption for that condition would be
                        railway facilities on one side of the Quarter Section in place of the future
                        streetcar lines otherwise predicted.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of an ultimate population of the Quarter Section, that frontage
                        - 1280 x 4 or 5120 feet - will doubtless prove excessive as compared with
                        business frontage in average towns of that population and, accordingly, only
                        about 5/8 of that frontage conferring transfer points and principal
                        centerway entrance corners for stores and shops; and less accessible
                        frontage for supply yards, garages, storehouses, etc.</p>
                    <p>Since the traffic point will be the most useful business site it is suggested
                        that the most general local industries can be accommodated there, beginning
                        with the existing transfer corner as the first arcade courts structure.
                        Built full to the street inter-section line such a building will sacrifice
                        none of the most available shop frontage.</p>
                    <p>We must realize that a high organism only will lead to great and real freedom
                        for artistic expression. For analogy, the whole city may be compared to a
                        tree with its unified circulating system of industry represented by the
                        stem, roots and branches, the rootlets and the leaves, all continuous and
                        constantly interoperating to augment, repair and maintain the system's
                        integrity. In the great industrial city we have all that now, more or less
                        efficient, in this way and just as certain to end disastrously if limited to
                        these purposes as in the case of a tree without its <hi rend="ul"

                    <p>the <hi rend="ul">Domestic</hi> functions to generate, vitalize and
                        perpetuate, the organism with each flower as distinctive, independent and
                        complete, even geometric if you please, as is the characteristic of highly
                        developed special organisms. For the flower and the family too, doubtless,
                        the most efficient unit is the considerable organized group for purely
                        domestic purposes represented by the all-conquering, youngest and most vital
                        order of the floral kingdom - the compositae <note>the Asteraceae (aster)
                            family?</note>. The civic organism may best survive with grouped
                        domestic organisms such as are possible to a segregated purely domestic
                        community development.</p>
                    <p>The established general skeleton not only in Chicago but predominant in
                        America is the gridiron of main thoroughfares at half mile intervals in each
                        direction affording, for typical units of subdivision, quarter-section plats
                        of 160 acres. With the level land and with other conditions so
                        characteristic not only characteristic of a large part of Chicago but of a
                        majority of newer growing towns we can, in a typical scheme, deal very
                        generally with the structural elements of the problem and eliminate
                        non-essential though important variations that would have to be considered
                        in the event of execution for a particular site. Any scheme of development
                        that is to be extended over a considerable time must first, because of the
                        complexities of democratic life, be flexible to accommodate more
                        contingencies than can be predicted but by no means need it be amorphous as
                        in the usual "gridiron" nor arbitrary in restrictions as in the German
                        "Zone" systems. Above all we have to avoid running into speculation outside
                        of reality. Co-operative <hi rend="ul">industrial</hi> site requirements are
                        reciprocal with general circulative accommodation and habitation, and
                        domestic social <hi rend="ul">private</hi> site requirements demand a
                        reciprocally specialized and <hi rend="ul">distributive</hi> communication
                        accommodation.</p>
                    <p>The phase of the general subject that is termed Occupation considers the
                        desirability of relative positions in the tract for the</p>

                    <p>various functions and the proportionate areas and suitable plot shapes and
                        aspects for those special uses. The quarter-section site will not be
                        considered as a focal point in the city and our aim may well be to make
                        available the most space possible for specialized occupation that the
                        traffic necessities will permit; to have those spaces adapted by location,
                        size and shape for the specific purposes public or private that are desired.
                        It may be taken for granted that in general a rectangular or obtuse angled
                        plot will be preferred and that the building plots shall be related to each
                        other most simply, <hi rend="ul">that is geometrically</hi>, because only
                        thus can they be grouped architecturally to advantage especially with that
                        degree of repetition dictated by economy as well as the aesthetic necessity
                        for restfulness. Where the site is flat and the problem an economic one,
                        expense and difficulties of irregular curves and of acute intersections may,
                        and must of course, be avoided entirely.</p>
                    <p>The circumferential allotments on the boundary streets are for <hi rend="ul"
                            >industrial functions</hi>. The lots for all these purposes are strictly
                        rectangular, with rear alley shipping frontages as well as street store
                        frontage free from alley crossings and of 100 feet depth. The typical
                        frontage allotment is set at 30 feet as being capable of division into two
                        15 foot spans, the most economical in construction as well as constituting a
                        reasonable minimum limit for the single store compartments. Two lots can,
                        moreover, accommodate three spans of 20 feet, the maximum economical
                        construction limit of span, and suitable for large unobstructed stores, with
                        the advantageous double-column line disposition for important emporiums.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the circumferential Industrial allotments the area of this
                        development is to be devoted to home life in the same sense that includes,
                        in addition to private habitats, those features of education, play and
                        social congregation, leisure occupation and rest that</p>

                        stimulate the prevalent amorphous condition of social life in a great
                        metropolis and rather to develop largely independent units within the limits
                        of personal fellowship. Standing apart and well organized, these internal
                        attractions will be able to exert to the utmost the popular healthy
                        standards of the group as a whole against those of less normal individual
                        types and thus at least minimize the forced or unsought evil influences that
                        account so largely for saloons, for instance, among a multitude of baneful
                        time-killing pursuits and the remote activities of mass groups of the young

                        most accessibility to transportation lines, being of more transient
                        character than individual homes.</p>
                    <p>Hedges or irregular shrubbery constitute the best means of separating and
                        beautifying for every variation between isolated yards and neighborhood
                        lawns in one harmonious park-like ensemble for our rear outlook. Proper
                        planning of even the smallest house can eliminate the need for back or alley
                        entrances and accomplish the aims of specialized functions and convenience
                        with the privacy that distinguishes our lives from those of any other time
                        or nation.</p>
                    <p>A simple system of street nomenclature is important in direct proportion with
                        the high development of the system's organization. Herein as related to the
                        city as a whole the number of the quarter section of the community itself
                        appears.</p>
                    <p>There is no excuse for overhead wires nor poles nor yet for mutilated
                        pavements for when the sewers are excavated it is only necessary to omit
                        refilling of the excavation and to pour concrete into the sides of the
                        trench about a box form as it is moved along! to equip with stub ducts, and
                        to provide manholes for the concrete pavement when laid overhead, to have,
                        complete, an accessible warm passage conduit ample for all water, gas, and
                        heating and other equipment pipes and wires as needed; all at an
                        insignificant charge of not more than one dollar a front foot as against a
                        dependence on Franchise buttressed public monopolies whose income must
                        provide for duplication excavations, poles, as well as maintenance charges
                        and pavement replacements altogether out of comparison with this single
                        conduit cost. There should be no stub end streets.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough that the homes be reached directly only, even if at the same
                        time free from through traffic, since they are supplied</p>

                    <p>in numerous needs by distributing or collecting agencies for foods, mail,
                        papers, garbage and ashes. <hi rend="ul">Such needs are uneconomically met
                            in stub streets</hi>, loops or the like, for the services are often
                        competitive or, if not, are discontinuous as in mail delivery where
                        retracing steps may aggregate in great loss of efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Study of the internal lines of this quarter section taken as a distribution
                        system graduated in thoroughfare width (from 18-20 feet) as well as in
                        equipment proportionately to the relative tributary areas, shows it to be
                        continuous for such service without being attractive to any more general
                        thoroughfare usage. The four shorter "Centerways" have, however, a special
                        linking function as explained hereinafter.</p>
                    <p>Because of natural gravitation of business to the through line boundaries of
                        the tract, it is important as well as feasible to arrange internal lines to
                        discourage useless artificial intrusion of discordant commercial elements
                        and to seclude the domestic community from industrial circulation. For that
                        reason entering streets are allowed to pass through only with at least
                        quarter diversion if short, or greater obstruction if exceeding an ordinary
                        block. The congregation function of the internal communication system of
                        these tracts are of special function for domestic social requirements only.</p>
                    <p>The garden fronted park "Play Courts," "Play Fields," and "Gymnasium Courts"
                        of various sorts are supplemented by a system of approach paths as well as
                        surrounding internal paths marking the first stage in the public social
                        congregating <note>reading from N-YHS</note> system. The internal streets
                        are supplemented with an informal winding scheme of paths with irregular
                        shrub and tree plantations in the external angles not required for sport,
                        making of the whole one continuous circulating pedestrian parkway tributary
                        in use and reciprocating in vistas with the "Common" Center. Especially, as
                        relieved from all large vehicle</p>

                    <p>transit, it is the proper way for the children at leisure times.</p>
                    <p>Since such <note>each</note> triangular quadrant of the quarter-section may
                        be taken to require ultimately an eight room school, the most advantageous
                        location of their bisecting "Centerways" makes of them in connection with
                        the "Gateways" the shortest possible diagonal out routes between home and
                        school that are thus only about two blocks apart in the extreme instances.</p>
                    <p>The location of the domestic center band-stand, pool, park and assembly
                        buildings provide for night as well as day use. This impressive grouping of
                        community buildings must make it representative and establish for it no mean
                        interest to the whole city. Thus as an element in that created social
                        organism it is properly recognized as a foundation for community pride. The
                        intimately interwoven relationships of the Central communal functions can
                        well be joined together only in a protected or enclosed passageway for the
                        students and visitors, the entire promenade having for its outlook the
                        public gardens setting off the pool with its central feature of an open
                        pagoda designed as a music pavilion occupying the geometric center of the
                        tract, as well as with underground conduit-way for their cooperative
                        hydraulic, mechanical and electric systems herein accomplished with utmost
                        economy through disposition in a slightly interrupted circle.</p>

                    <p>The outlying features and conditions and the location of Through Routes
                        should be the determining factors in the planning of all outlying districts.
                        Community plans should be mathematical but not mechanical. As the years pass
                        Chicago should continue to acquire possession of lovely open spaces to
                        become parks as it extends its boundaries, and interests, which are one with
                        the State, just as the Hikers did a quarter of a century ago. The citizens
                        should vie with each other in discovering such areas.</p>
                    <p>Between them where thoroughfares have not already been established as they
                        have in Chicago, are the residential districts (see Griffith plan) whose
                        streets would leave the thoroughfares at right angles and meet between them
                        in obtuse angles as desirable for buildings as the right angle, often more
                        desirable, especially for civic structures. The streets within come into
                        these secondary streets at right angles forming, for the most part, squares
                        or parallelograms, never acute angles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="ul">COMMUNITY CENTERS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There has been much misunderstanding of the basis of Community Centers and
                        consequently much loss to business enterprise and many failures. Only timely
                        Town Planning can prevent this and this Community Planning should include at
                        least the whole state. Surveys should in no case determine the lines of
                        communications but only give the facts necessary for their determination,
                        levels as well as distances, for to place rectangular roads on sloping
                        ground is as fatal as to place curving roads on flat land.</p>
                    <note>"Hikers" may refer to an informal group (including WBG and Dwight Perkins)
                        who, according to MMG, hiked the Chicago area as well as Illinois and
                        pressed government agencies to set aside parks and reserves. See Section IV,
                        No. 12., page 293.</note>

                    <p>Their conformation in ledges is the ideal for successive tiers of stately
                        homes, and the sandstone substructure of these ledges affords the most
                        elegant of all building materials. It also constitutes a district free of
                        wind and dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water, and above as to
                        cooling currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most
                        equable, even precluding frost - all the conditions for the best health.</p>
                    <p>Some years ago the genius of Walter Burley Griffin, architect and town
                        planner, saw the amazing possibilities of the three virgin promontories on
                        the western side of Middle Harbor with their glorious four miles of water
                        frontage. His enthusiasm inspired a group of Australian capitalists among
                        his professional clients, and the magnificent amphitheatres passed into the
                        hands of Greater Sydney Development Association Limited.</p>
                    <p>This is literally a case where the last is best, for here is the only harbor
                        frontage free from the threat of commerce and quite out of the field of
                        industrial expansion now in evidence in every other direction. It is the
                        only waterside development that can be, and will be, protected against
                        flats.</p>

                    <p>With these principles controlling, endless variety can arise. When the land
                        is not level the contours should become a controlling factor (see Leeton
                            <note>Australia</note>) but the geometric principles hold.</p>
                    <p>Buildings should be as straightforward solutions of their problems as the
                        layouts of the districts. But this does not mean that they should be stupid
                        and uninteresting repetitions. No natural beauty should be injured but each
                        one taken advantage of. Environing established communities should be
                        considered as centers for express ways and branches to aim toward in order
                        to connect with the radial roads that start from the various towns. Each
                        town will of course require special consideration for its growth. All high
                        speed through traffic should be depressed, open as a whole but covered over
                        where it concentrates.</p>
