                    <p>WALTER GRIFFIN VISITED AT AUSTRALIA HOME</p>
                    <bibl>Chicago Daily News 13 January, 1934.<lb/>by Mr. Werntz of the Chicago
                        Academy of Fine Arts.</bibl>
                    <p>Landing unexpectedly, we were surprised to find ourselves in Australia;
                        surprised at the grandeur of the coast, the great forests, the hills and
                        flowers; marveling at the stunning birds, at the animals born with a duck's
                        bill and the habit of laying eggs, at the pouched kangaroos everywhere and
                        at the lovable Koala bears that weep real tears when scolded.</p>
                    <p>Most of all, however, we were surprised to remember that way back in a 1911
                        world wide competition a Chicago architect named Walter Burley Griffin had
                        won a prize of approximately $10,000. The prize was given for the best plan
                        of the projected federal capital for this great fifth continent, to be
                        located far from its coast, from its established metropolitan cities, in
                        what is called the Australian bush.</p>
                    <p>Disembarking at Melbourne for the purpose of seeing that unique national
                        capital, we found, once more to our surprise that, in spite of advertising
                        proclaiming that the town "is built to the artist's plan" nobody seemed to
                        know Mr. Griffin, know what he had done or where he was; nor did the
                        citizens other than vaguely know where Canberra was or how to get there,
                        though its precincts are said to contain more than 900 square miles.</p>
                    <p>Page - 2</p>
                    <p>Motor to City - Finding the railroad journey made awkward by several changes,
                        we finally decided to motor up, seeing the inland country more intimately on
                        our way to this, "the world's newest, fairest city" unique in that it had
                        been entirely planned years in advance of building.</p>
                    <p>When after two days of picturesque lonely driving, we approached Canberra,
                        which is the district's aboriginal name appropriately meaning "meeting
                        place", we could scarcely see the city for the great amphitheatre of hills
                        in which it sits; and because - in spite of the age of the project - the
                        world war made the cost impracticable and only comparatively few of the
                        projected buildings have been built; but mainly</p>

                    <p>because some joyous benefactor to the entire human race had lined miles of
                        the approaching boulevards and the polygonal intermediate streets of the
                        residential districts with flowering peach, plum, cherry, lilac and mimosa
                        trees.</p>
                    <p>When once the flowering roadways, parks and sports reserves were behind us we
                        found the federal buildings - of temporary materials and construction - good
                        looking and roomily spaced. The Museum of Anatomy, using only a few
                        conventionalized frogs for decorative accents, was the best building in
                        functional line that I saw in Australia.</p>
                    <p>Reaching Sydney at last by way of a picturesque old gold-mining camp - where
                        somebody once swindled a Chinese into buying a rundown hotel built of bricks
                        made from local mud, from which the artful oriental recovered ten times its
                        cost from the gold dust in its bricks - through the Blue Mountains (truly
                        blue) and the spectacular Jenolan caves, boasting their own geologically
                        indigenous architecture, we learned that Walter Burley Griffin was still in
                        Sydney; that he had acquired a huge tract of rocky virgin land covering
                        three high points along the magnificent harbor, and that he was building
                        Castlecrag - a model suburb.</p>
                    <p>We motored out to Castlecrag but on location only three or four buildings
                        were even partly visible. Ambling along a beautifully shrubbed asphalt road,
                        we found the Griffins' unique concrete home and studio concealed from the
                        road by flowers and foliage, but with magnificent views over shore and
                        harbor from the studio and terrace on the opposite side.</p>
                    <p>Plan Includes Everything - Besides the delightful home studio, the Griffins
                        have their city office in one of the most modern commercial buildings in
                        Sydney, where I found them busy collaborating with a Russian engineer in
                        doing - another surprise - incinerators.</p>
                    <p>Knowing Griffin I was sure there was still another surprise catch somewhere.
                        For this architect, fashioning incinerator containers</p>

                    <p>really means designing tasteful architectural monuments to "health",
                        "sanitation", "beauty", in which are installed great steel machines that
                        dispose of civic garbage without noise, odor, smoke or gas. Having designed
                        the Nation's capital city, designed some of its best theatres, colleges and
                        business structures, created its only truly swank suburb, and completed the
                        circle by furnishing beauty to its most humble civic responsibility, have
                        kept Mr. Griffin very busy and I doubt his being aware that he is probably
                        the only man in the world who has had the opportunity of designing a
                        continent.</p>

                        <hi rend="ul">DEMOCRACY</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Americans have smashed the atom as <note>President Thomas</note> Jefferson
                        smashed the power of governments by creating a new type, and <note>President
                            Andrew</note> Jackson smashed the bureaucracy. Their tasks today are to
                            <hi rend="ul">construct</hi>, and their fields as individuals is the
                        world. What the Gods have given us we are under obligation to share with
                        humanity, with the world. It is for us to free humanity for we alone are
                        free human beings. Only individuals can do this, for the Christ broke up all
                        peoples and races giving the individual spirit, the Ego, the Light, to every
                        man in the world.</p>
                    <p>Democracy is as important as the smashing of the atom. Unless democracy is
                        applied to humanity as a whole the power released in the atom will become
                        demonic and destroy humanity. Only in America has it been experienced. In
                        democracy the Spirit of the human is released as in Atom smashing the Spirit
                        of Matter is released.</p>
                    <p>In this physical experiment the 20th century has fulfilled its basic task
                        with the dual law - that of up and down, inside and outside, force and form
                        - where you can't have one without the other. The reality of matter is form
                        and nothing else. The smashing of the atom releases forces, no substances
                        are to be found when form is smashed. The smashing of the atomic form frees
                        the spiritual forces of matter. They are not things that can be weighed and
                        measured except in terms of force.</p>
                    <p>Thus do the Orient and the Occident meet, through America.</p>
                    <p>The reason why America won the war and will win the peace is because the
                        strength and power of the individual is recognized and given full play. The
                        first step was to escape from the rest of the world - the ancient eastern
                        world, Eur-Asia - to establish a community organization in which no
                        individual nor group had power over another, a community whose basic
                        principle is Equity. There are many lovely and wonderful people else-</p>

                    <p>where in the world but they are helpless. Migration to America frees their
                        spiritual forces. That is the magic of the United States. The founders of
                        the <hi rend="ul">CONGRESSIONAL</hi> system smashed the political atom which
                        holds the rest of humanity in bondage.</p>
                    <p>The immediate task of Americans is to go out individually to every part of
                        the world - emigrate instead of immigrate the watchword - and break down the
                        bondage of individuals everywhere. It is a difficult but not impossible
                        task. It is the task of path-finders. The following is the story of one such

                        GRIFFIN</p>
                    <p>Then came that last year. Again the busy cram-ful years seemed like leisure
                        days in the light of this driving year into which was crowded a life's
                        experience and a life's work. Few indeed are the architects who have put
                        forth such an amount, such a range, of work with such a richness and variety
                        of design as fruited in this one year.</p>
                    <p>Then a few hours of excruciating agony as an internal organ gave way due to
                        that fall, fighting fire at midnight on the rocks of Castlecrag to which he
                        so willingly sacrificed himself. An operation, a few days of his body's
                        fight for recovery from the wounds inflicted in a brave attempt to overcome
                        the difficulty, with no thought but of recovery in either of our minds, and
                        then the slowing heart, the coma when I poured into his ear the wonder of
                        the life I had had with him; and then he was a free man indeed going on to
                        his next task into which one knew he would throw himself with the same ardor
                        with which he had tackled every opportunity of this incarnation, every
                        opportunity to solve the problems for a present civilization. And one knew
                        that he would not ask for easier tasks in his next incarnation but would
                        rejoice in new faculties developed in readiness for tackling harder tasks
                        still on his return.</p>
                    <p>At five in the morning I left the hospital and walked the five miles home,
                        much of it along the river bank, in the cool fresh quiet. As I turned into
                        the gate our Indian gardener came to meet me with questioning eyes. I lifted
                        my hands, for like my mother I always talk with my hands, and said "He is
                        gone." With a startled look he turned and fled. He too had felt the
                        sweetness of the segnor <note>senor?, i.e., Walter Burley Griffin</note>. He
                        would not have had the blow fall on him. But a short time before his pretty,
                        gentle little wife had been ill, was possessed as they say. They lived in
                        the service quarters on the place. Our neighbor in the other half of our
                        palace told us what they were doing. The chanting voice of their physician
                        could be</p>
                    <pb n="8"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 8 ====]</p>
                    <p>heard all through the night; praying that she should not be taken, that she
                        should not die, that the demon they were exorcising should take someone
                        else, there were so many in the household. The next day she was better. In a
                        few days she was well and Mr. Griffin was gone. One does not say these
                        things do not happen but one can know that by whatever means the crossing of
                        the boundary came about it was brought about because Mr. Griffin himself had
                        decided that that step should be taken. He will return when he is ready for
                        the next task.</p>
                    <p>The message had come to a busy office asking Griffin to go to India. In
                        asking him for sketches for a library for the Lucknow University, they had
                        suggested that he send them alternative sketches one with the Indian feeling
                        - the other completely modern. That was not Griffin's way. When the office
                        saw his sketches it was unanimously agreed that in the one design he had met
                        both requirements of his client for the building was thoroughly in harmony
                        with Indian architecture and yet was completely modern. They accepted his
                        design and asked him to come to India. We all agreed that it was high time
                        that Griffin, who never took holidays, should go on a vacation. His young
                        partner, Mr. Nicholls, had come to maturity in all ways and could carry on
                        in the interim in Sydney. Preparations for departure were rushed through and
                        again he ran away from his wife on this new adventure beyond the boundaries.</p>
                    <p>8 October, 1935 - Castlecrag, New South Wales - Genie darling. Things have
                        been moving swiftly lately, so I'll tell you recent history
                        backward....Today Walt sails for India. Or rather his boat sailed on
                        Saturday, three days ago, and he goes by train to Adelaide to pick it up
                        there. As he says, these have been his three days of grace, and ours for we
                        had his help to carry us through the Festival of which more later.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 9 ====]</p>
                    <p>For several months now, there has been a lively correspondence by air mail
                        and cable between Walt and Mr. Alagappan <note>Alagappan Mudalir</note>, an
                        Indian contractor, who has been doing important work in India for some time
                        and who has now asked Walt to act an architect, consultant, in a building
                        company he has formed. The connection was made through Mrs. <note>Ula</note>
                        Maddocks who is tremendously interested in Walt's architecture, and a great
                        barracker for it, and Mr. <note>Ronald</note> Craig, her friend and ours, a
                        young man who went to India about three years ago, who has married an Indian
                        girl and has a fine son, a remarkable looking baby. Mr. Craig has raised a
                        beard since he went over there which gives him quite an Oriental look. He is
                        a journalist and an enterprising man.</p>
                    <p>The first outcome of the connection was that Mr. Alagappan consulted Walt re
                        the foundations of a huge Buddhist temple they are building. They are not in
                        sympathy with the Europeanizing of the architecture there and Walt agrees
                        with them that Indian architecture is a living thing which can't be said of
                        architecture elsewhere in the world except, we think, in Walt's hands.</p>
                    <p>Next Mr. Alagappan, who has done some building for the Lucknow University,
                        asked him to make sketch plans for a library for the University suggesting
                        two, one Indian, one European. Instead he sent one which looks and feels
                        quite Indian and yet is the last word in modernism. Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls
                        both worked on the drawings and it was a beautiful set. They were submitted
                        to the Chancellor, a meeting was called and a cable came - "Plans accepted,
                        come on first boat" and off he has gone.</p>

                    <p>When someone asked him if he was going to follow the Indian style he laughed
                        and said - "I am going to lead it." You don't often get that sort of a
                        remark from Walt but as I said to Mrs. Maddocks, - who by the way has bought
                        a house here, she and her husband, a musician, and their baby, bouncing 18
                        months old Deirdre being very pleasant neighbors - he went at that problem
                        as if the future of all India hung on its proper solution. But of course
                        that is the way he tackles all problems.</p>

                    <p>We are all tremendously interested in his trip, individually, architecturally
                        and Anthroposophically. It is seldom that a European goes into India at the
                        invitation of an Indian, not just as a social guest but to assist in solving
                        their present problems. Dr. Steiner says it is extremely important that the
                        East, especially India, and the West should come together on terms of mutual
                        understanding and sympathy. No one could be better than Walt from this
                        angle. Miss <note>Ruth Janet (Lute)</note> Drummond, who is now the General
                        Secretary of the Anthroposophic Society in Australia, is all excitement over
                        it though we hardly know how we can get along without him here in our new
                        undertakings.</p>
                    <p>It was Walt who in the necessarily united professions of Architecture and
                        Town Planning carried on the work of Louis Sullivan in raising architecture
                        in America and the world to professional standards in creative design and in
                        really solving problems. Through such seed the break-away from the bondage
                        to tradition has become an established thing in America and bit by bit we
                        see signs of his work in Town Planning coming to fruition in practice there,
                        the standard for which was set in the Canberra design in 1912 which laid the
                        foundation for community planning. Recently Walt said to me that he had as
                        yet seen nothing done in Town Planning that was not laid down in the
                        Canberra plan, and he was constantly on the lookout. You will perhaps
                        remember his first words when he received</p>

                    <p>These fundamentals are so simple yet almost never put into practice - the
                        simultaneous attack of the problems of distribution and occupation, the one
                        requiring radial thoroughfares wide enough for all kinds of traffic, and the
                        other requiring the complete elimination of acute angles by bringing in the
                        distributive narrower streets at right angles to the thoroughfares. The
                        third requirement is the bringing of the country into the city by making all
                        residential blocks large enough in area to enclose open parks and
                        playgrounds in their interior thus taking up no street frontage and so being
                        no extravagance. For lack of this our children are degenerating physically,
                        mentally and morally, bringing delinquency and crime.</p>

                    <p>Several years ago when prizes were offered for the best solution of the
                        minimum cost house, probably the most difficult architectural problem, all
                        four of the prizes were given to practically exact replicas of a house he
                        had erected while still in Chicago and which was widely published. None of
                        them were quite so perfect as his own. I myself had seen that problem
                        struggled over in various offices of good architects, unsuccessfully, and
                        when I went into his office it was with astonishment that I watched
                        solutions drop from his pencil one after another each a perfect little
                        classic and each totally different from the others like the children of
                        different parents.</p>

                        breathless when we first went over to see it. We both saw the angel forces
                        playing around it as if it were a living thing. She stood beside me and
                        described what she saw and it corresponded with what I was seeing.</p>

                        was a cable from Mr. Griffin that came yesterday and announced his arrival
                        early in November. Lucknow is the most satisfactory commercial center in
                        India. It is a decent city too in many other respects than its commercial
                        conveniences - personally interesting Indians, fine samples of Moghul
                        architecture, and a municipality that is doing more toward a hygenic
                        environment than most of such bodies here.</p>
                    <p>9 October, 1935, Castlecrag, New South Wales - Dear Walt, Am doubtful of this
                        reaching you at Adelaide so will just drop a line. I can't go in early today
                        as Mr. Nicholls is bringing out that man this afternoon and I promised him a
                        cup of tea. I did not find the Bhagavad-Gita I thought I had, but another,
                        not in poetry, which Mrs. Maddocks must have left here. Am sending it to
                        Perth. The best of all translations is that of Dhan Gopal Mukerji. Am also
                        sending the prints in the Home Magazine of our open air production in the
                        valley of "Iphigeneia." I couldn't bear to spoil your happy departure by
                        speaking of the catastrophe of Anna Ickes' death. Aside from the grief at
                        the loss of a very dear friend I feel that an important connection with
                        affairs over there has been broken and that's a great misfortune. But since
                        we can no longer hold the completely unscientific concept of things
                        happening by chance I feel that perhaps it was more important that she
                        should be back here toward the close of the century than that she should
                        remain here now.</p>
                    <p>I slept sound last night and I am sure you did. A great stillness seems to
                        have fallen on Australia. Hope this reaches you in</p>
                    <note>Anna Ickes (1873-1935), social reformer and Illinois legislator, was the
                        daughter of Mary J. Wilmarth (1837-1919), a reformer and suffragist, and the
                        wife of Harold L. Ickes, an activist and New Deal political figure. Mrs.
                        Ickes died in an auto accident in New Mexico.</note>

                    <p>10 October, 1935, Castlecrag, New South Wales, Dear Walt, I sent a letter
                        yesterday to the boat in Adelaide but the P.O. man insisted it needn't go by
                        air so I sent it regular and I bet you didn't get it. (He didn't.) Was there
                        any later train by which you could have reached your boat? Inconceivable!
                        Had a pleasant evening at Anthro with Mr. McDowall in charge. Was sorry you
                        had to start off with the sad news of Anna Ickes' death. I think you should
                        write to Mr. Ickes. Enclosed is my note to him.</p>
                    <p>Miss Drummond and the girls are planning to be out here Sunday afternoon to
                        get started on the Nativity Play in the valley. No sooner through with one
                        than we are on with another. She wants to enrich the play with angel and
                        archangel tableaux and song and instrumental music.</p>
                    <p>I think I have won that thing called a quiet soul. Marion. Enclosed - Dear
                        Mr. Ickes, One's heart stands still with such a shock as that of the news of
                        Anna's death. One turns this way and that to keep from being filled with
                        pessimism at such a catastrophe. We feel we must have some basis for
                        understanding. We are told that this is a critically important century and I
                        find myself saying that important as Anna's work was here there must be
                        urgent necessity for her to assist in the more critical times toward the end
                        of the century and she has been hurried away so that she may be back for
                        that work. It does not satisfy the heart but it helps us to understand that
                        there is no such thing as chance and that Anna's own will as well as that of
                        the Hierarchies stood ready to make the necessary sacrifices, and we school
                        ourselves to do the same. With love to you and the young folk, Marion.</p>
                    <p>Still carrying on his perpetual fight with Bureaucracy the whole weight of
                        which is always against anything in the nature of</p>

                    <p>solution of problems or progress, Griffin's first note back was to carry on
                        the struggle to establish a municipality which would safeguard instead of
                        destroying the unique natural beauty of Sydney's foreshores.</p>
                    <p>12 October, 1935 Perth, West Australia. Dear Alderman Parker, Mr. Palmer
                        Moffat wanted me to give you the enclosed note some time ago but I found no
                        chance to do so at an opportune time when our affairs were under Council's
                        consideration and particularly in the rush of leaving for this sudden
                        professional call to Lucknow. I wanted to talk over thoroughly and answer
                        any of your questions concerning our long relationship to the Willoughby
                        Council with whom we have tried our best to cooperate through considered
                        land planning methods to save for future ages the last remnant of Sydney's
                        once unparalleled harbour in the face of puzzling lack of sympathy and
                        support officially.</p>
                    <p>The vital difficulty is that our plans for preserving the landscape and
                        dedicating the foreshores for public benefit is constantly jeopardized by
                        pressure for cash where there is no cash to squeeze out during a period when
                        there has been no income nor any business, nor hope of disposing of a foot
                        of land for nearly seven years on end. None of our creditors has any
                        intention whatever of carrying on with our plans involving the sacrifice of
                        lookouts, the water frontage and other most valuable parts from which they
                        could most readily realize cash when the demand returns; nor of saving the
                        forests which they have already been clearing away in the cases where they
                        have already come into possession. Our acquisition of such parts as
                        "Castlecrag Cape Estate" was at great cost and undertaken solely because of
                        the need to save thousands of feet of water front whose subdivision into
                        lots the District Court had, after much litigation, compelled the Council to
                        accept with no reservation whatever for public access to the water.</p>
                    <p>The destructive operations were being rushed when I finally intervened paying
                        as much as ten pounds per foot to recover water front lots</p>
                    <pb n="15"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 15 ====]</p>
                    <p>already sold, in order that continuous access could be granted. And this
                        reservation was then incorporated in our project submitted to Council.
                        Unfortunately the Valuer General mistook this defensive measure as a basis
                        for increased valuation with resultant rates that have accrued at a greater
                        rate than I could in my practice earn money to keep up with, whilst not a
                        foot of the land has been marketable at any price whatever.</p>
                    <p>By merely accepting, in lieu of cash, frontage to the water as valued by the
                        Valuer General, at the present lowest known period, the Council will have
                        benefited by the rates so out of proportion that they cannot be otherwise
                        met except through abandonment and loss of the prospective continuous
                        foreshore reservation for the whole of Willoughby as provided for in the
                        plans of our development. I was able to show Council in 1928 how easily the
                        complete project could be realized with our help when conditions were less
                        propitious generally than they are now or ever can be again. Whatever more I
                        can do in this direction I hope there will be opportunity for me to offer
                        when I return in three months. Yours faithfully, Walter B. Griffin.</p>
                    <p>Enclosure - Alderman Parker. The bearer, Mr. Griffin, is a personal friend of
                        mine and his position has been fully ventilated to various aldermen who have
                        promised to see him through. Will you personally interest yourself with
                        Lamb, Thompson and your confreres in adjusting the matter to the mutual
                        benefit of all. I will esteem it a personal favour. L.D. Moffat, 22,1,1935.</p>
                    <p>14 October, 1935, Castlecrag. Dear Walt, This morning I climbed the gum tree
                        and sawed off the parts that were contacting the four telephone wires. They
                        were growing so beautifully it seemed a shame but the tree doesn't look bad
                        now and the widespreading branches will soon put things entirely to rights I
                        am sure. It seemed like old times to be climbing trees. I was famous for
                        that in my childhood, climbing trees the boys couldn't climb.</p>

                    <p>This morning came your letter from Adelaide. What a shame you didn't see Mr.
                        James Alexander Smith. Last night a group of the girls and Miss Drummond as
                        well as Miss Birch and Miss Leeson and a friend from Tasmania came to tea, a
                        sort of party to talk over our triumphs so to speak. Brought me a huge bunch
                        of flannel flowers and I dressed up in my Chinese gown which tickled them
                        all. The Chinese table cover is a constant joy. The children, my baby
                        artists, painted a picture of it Saturday. It'll be a long time before you
                        get this scrawl but such is life when you take to the briny deep. Tonight I
                        go to the Castlecrag Dais. Mr. Stoker has the evening - two plays and a
                        lecture. Miss Crabb was pleased with our beloved Pholiota <note>house</note>
                        plan. A one room house should suit her as well as it did us in those good
                        old days. Love Marion.</p>
                    <p>15 October, 1935, Dear Gene, All kinds of things have piled up in connection
                        with Walt's departure and the aftermath of the Festival so will just send on
                        these things. Walt has a three month round ticket but that gives him only
                        one month in India so we are assuming he will extend his visit to stay six
                        months anyway. Nicholls' last words to him were "If there is anything to
                        stay for, why stay." and mine were the same. His acting as consultant for a
                        busy organization will not interfere with his practicing privately any more
                        than his work with the Federal Capital did. There is no telling what may
                        develop. Tell Clarmyra the finger paints arrived all right. Many thanks.</p>

                    <p>Tauris" of Euripides which was given at Easter time, well know. Of this
                        latter Isobel Grey wrote as follows:- "Mr. and Mrs. Burley Griffin have
                        established at Castlecrag, Middle Harbour, the most beautiful little theatre
                        conceivable. Adventure is the keynote of the evening and you experience a
                        quickening thrill of excitement as you take the winding road in Castlecrag
                        that leads down to the Haven Scenic Theatre - and the Past. It is a dark,
                        narrow road out into the deadly stillness, and menaced on either side by
                        overlapping ti-scrub. You feel apprehensively that the road might lead
                        anywhere - that anything might happen in this strange place with only the
                        stars for witness. But the mood is gone when you turn a bend and come upon
                        other cars parked and groups of people making their way to the seats, with
                        subdued laughter. Flares are lit here and there behind the tall trees so,
                        from where we are, only the sparks that every now and then fly out into the
                        darkness are visible. Gracious gums with the stars caught in their hair
                        watch calmly and serenely, so wise in their ancient knowledge that has grown
                        into leaves and branches, from seed to seed, forever nourished by the winds
                        blowing in from across the sea. Now everything is hushed as from the Temple
                        steals a strain of music, wild and sweet and haunting, that seems to hold in
                        the rise and fall of every drawn-out note a sad lament for things that are
                        no more."</p>
                    <p>Where a path down the East slope of the valley forks to the South and North
                        is the Prometheus Rock where that mighty Being poured out his defiance of
                        the Gods and his message to man giving him the gift of anger, the fire
                        through which he could learn to reenter the realms of spirit; up from the
                        moonlit water below, the dragon bearing Oceanus wound its way to the middle
                        terrace above Prometheus, and from above, the Oceanides swept down in
                        splendid formation. Always the choruses were handled not in fixed forms as
                        in the architectural settings of the usual outdoor or Greek theatres, but
                        liquid, or sweeping like a breeze across the valley to form, with the

                    <p>Sometimes all silver and green as the Oceanides who swept down to share the
                        fate of Prometheus to be sunk, with him and the rock to which he was bound,
                        into the depths. Sometimes the all gold and blue of the angelic hosts.
                        Sometimes all colors - lavender and blue, gold and scarlet, green and rose
                        and purple, floating iridescence, with beauty such as we find in the works
                        of Botticelli and Giotto before which we stand still and breathless. For it
                        was not the beauty of our modern spectacles but the shining of the soul and
                        spirit through the exquisite form and movement of our young people who had
                        at last found a means of expressing their true natures, supported by all the
                        elemental beings whose recognition by humans was at last freeing them from
                        their bondage.</p>
                    <p>21 October, 1935. Castlecrag. - The little Chinese rug is a constant joy and
                        I love to tell everybody that it was your parting shot. Am having a great
                        thrill feasting off our own loquats. Every morning I gather a dozen big
                        ones. So far my eating expenses are nil. The girls bring out so much Sundays
                        when they come to rehearsals that I live on it the rest of the week. Went to
                        the dentist yesterday. Though I haven't been for over a year he didn't find
                        anything to do except clean them. With an air of resignation he said they
                        were strong teeth and would last me my lifetime. I fancy he may not have
                        counted on that decision of ours to live for a hundred and fifty years -
                        only way to get through what we have undertaken.</p>
                    <p>This afternoon I went to Ivor's party - 4 years old. Fourteen infants from 2
                        to 6 years of age and as many grown ups. The little long table was brilliant
                        with all sorts of colored dainties and the children thrilled to bits.
                        Stewart, the two year old, was not allowed to have lemonade. After the
                        banquet hall was vacated he was found sitting at the head of the table with</p>

                    <p>25 October, 1935 - S.S. Mongolia - Dearest Marion, Your letter to the boat in
                        Adelaide was forwarded and reached me at Perth. When I read your letter I
                        marveled at your restraint at the parting, realizing your deep affection for
                        Anna. So far as my connection with Government is concerned we have had
                        enough to realize that the less we have of it the better for our welfare and
                        usefulness. Our Karma is in the opposite camp surely. I enclose my letter to
                        Mr. Ickes which I hope he will take in the right spirit. The wild flower
                        season was on in Perth so I walked from the interesting University buildings
                        back to Perth through the open forest, largely banksias. The main impression
                        was that given by the scarlet Kangaroo Paws in patches of acres in extent.
                        The species of bush flowers are different but chiefly of the same genera as
                        at Castlecrag but on the whole the bush was no more floriferous and far less
                        attractive in the formation and freedom from disheveled and weedy growths
                        than is Castlecrag. From the Leschnaultia biloba in the shops I realized
                        that there were sky blue heaths to be seen in other directions on the sand
                        hills but I did not have time to seek them out.</p>
                    <p>Though approaching the size of Adelaide, Perth is by no means so dignified
                        and gives the impression of rawness and newness which will disappear
                        sometime when the advantage of a waterfront site, much like Canberra with
                        the lakes, is realized. Mr. Davidson, the State Town Planner on whom I
                        called, is fully aware of the similarity and the possibilities and is using
                        his strong influence toward directing the official architectural development
                        onto the Perth Water Terraces where formal reclamation parkways are being
                        formed all across the city area.</p>
                    <p>I was glad to get confirmation, from his experience, of my objectives for New
                        South Wales Town Planning Legislation especially empowering</p>
                    <pb n="20"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 20 ====]</p>
                    <p>private owner groups to become Responsible Town Planning Authorities
                        independent of and as a protection against demoralizing Municipal Councils
                        and other political units. If it fits in with my convenience on the return
                        visit to Perth, Mr. Davidson wants to bring the Premier to Fremantle to give
                        me an official welcome which might work out to the ultimate advantage of
                        both of us as Town Planners. He is the one who got me to send him an
                        exhibition of our architectural work in 1930 which he displayed in spite of
                        the determined opposition of the Perth architects whom also he has sized up
                        fairly well. The Mongolia was due to leave Fremantle at 8 P.M. but when I
                        got on board then there was a telephone call from a newspaper reporter who
                        had a consignment from his editor to interview me. Since the ship did not
                        actually leave until 9 P.M. he came out by car 12 miles and discussed
                        various and sundry matters while I ate my dinner. Don't apprehend any more
                        of these garrulous effusions once I get ashore. Lovingly your worser half.

                    <p>22 October, 1935 - S.S. Mongolia - Dear Mr. <note>Harold L.</note> Ickes, The
                        news of Mrs. Ickes death reached Australia only just as I left on this
                        voyage of extension of my architectural fields to India. Only in thinking of
                        what my own wife means to me, the Marion Mahony of whom Anna Wilmarth had
                        been such a friend and benefactor, can I appreciate how tragic is this loss
                        to you. Religion hardly softens such a blow because faith has so little
                        validity any more. As a compensation however we are beginning to meet
                        evidence of wide-awake contact with life forces themselves so that human
                        understanding can be and is being extended for the making of an actual
                        science out of those mysteries that must always baffle physical science but
                        whose existence need not on that account be denied. Oriental life has always
                        been actuated by a sublime spiritual consciousness that Occidentals are
                        weaned away from, but the former have consequently a more realistic
                        acceptance of death which only a future understanding can restore to us;-
                        the comprehension of</p>

                        outstanding feature of the last Royal Capital as is the case with the center
                        of most of the ancient Capitals whose plans were magnificent conceptions
                        taking every advantage of every natural feature.</p>
                    <p>30 October, 1935 - Perfect weather has continued in Ceylon. On landing
                        Wednesday I made first for the native city where I got my ice-cream suit,
                        etc. and thereafter landed in Fremjee House, a guest house on the fringes of
                        the Cinnamon Gardens district which is a very beautiful suburb 3 miles out.
                        The house is an old Parsi mansion facing the ocean. It is run by two English
                        women one of whom, Miss Sheppard, started it in opposition to the two huge
                        hotels 15 years ago.</p>
                    <p>Room, private bath and meals but $3.00 a day. I have done the Cingalese and
                        Mohammedan sections and skimmed the Botanical Gardens. With exclusively
                        local government in the City and virtual local control in the State
                        Government, with only a casting vote of the British Governor General in the
                        native legislature, all the administration is manned and managed by the
                        Cingalese who are more apt than the Europeans in learning in the schools and
                        who have qualified themselves in English Universities for all the
                        professional positions. Of course that does not make the government better
                        (only the separation of the three functions can do that) than they were
                        before any more than woman suffrage in Australia did but it must, of course,
                        make the governing less objectionable.</p>
                    <p>This island is astounding with 7,000,000 inhabitants (equal to the total
                        population of Australia) on 60,000 square miles, and about 7,000 altogether
                        of European derivation. It is far more adequately</p>

                    <p>equipped with sumptuous public buildings of all sorts than is any Australian
                        State, also with public services, hospitals and welfare institutions of all
                        kinds including incineration. The wages so far as I can judge amount to
                        $0.50 a day where they get any, but expenses for them are almost
                        proportionally low, and need of shelter and clothes almost negligible.
                        Except for a few red brick essays of the time of Victoria it seems
                        impossible for the builders, native or English, ever to have done so badly
                        in any class of buildings as the British have perpetrated in the Colonies of
                        America or on the Pacific Ocean in every class of building. As I had
                        suspected, the prototype of those neo-classic houses in Melbourne that
                        attracted me so much is here also - of that back-block type of Australia's
                        oldest house, that of McArthur at Paramatta. Nothing therefore in
                        Architecture originated in Australia! The walled suburban lanes of
                        residential places with truly tropical verdure are as attractive as any
                        suburbs I have ever seen anywhere but the houses of the Europeans are apt to
                        be out of key. The roads are everywhere consistently good and the aesthetic
                        standard as to electric wiring is distinctly superior to that allowed by the
                        Sydney Municipal Council. Mr. Craig is coming to Bombay to meet me which
                        will make things very pleasant and easy.</p>
                    <p>29 October, 1935 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley
                        Griffin - Mrs. Maddocks is apparently seeing to it that I do my wifely duty
                        in writing to you for she has just rung to say she is bringing a note of
                        hers up the hill to enclose in mine. She hasn't had the long training I have
                        had re long distance calls, etc. so is assuming that wives' letters are
                        worth the air mail shilling even if there is no news to forward. Miss
                        Drummond is sending out notices of three lectures on the Four Ethers to be
                        given by me Wednesdays in November, and Mrs. Lemaitre was so overwhelming in
                        her enthusiasm about the diagrams I am using for my talks at the Michaelmas
                        Festival that I wouldn't dare appear without diagrams so I am doing those of
                        Wasmuth's first volume <note>Ernst Wasmuth's "Ausgefuhrte Bauten und
                            Entwurfe" of Frank Lloyd Wright</note>. It will make the talks easier.</p>

                    <p>Here comes Kaaren. Since she has been barred out of kindergarten because of
                        chickenpox, she usually makes four or five calls on me daily. Her mother has
                        just about gotten used to it by now. She is busily wiping her feet on the
                        mat. Such proprieties you never did see in a three year old. The first Gita
                        evening was very interesting. Miss Beale gave a lovely story of the birth of
                        Krishna from Schure's "Great Initiate" and last Sunday's Anthroposophic
                        evening here was very interesting too. Birch and Leeson again brought their
                        New Zealand friend who brought me a box of chocolates, and the Hunts
                        bringing Mrs. Badham, the Williams "pear", Bim and Roma and young Mrs.
                        Hilder and Sheppard. They all seemed much interested. Bim certainly does
                        make understanding remarks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tierney turned up with a wife and is contemplating building a house down
                        on their lot. Kaaren now knows the whole process of a letter going by mail
                        to India. I am going to your old Culture Society this evening. Such a
                        nuisance. I shan't know anybody I ought to know. Kaaren who is still perched
                        at the drafting board beside me says I'd better not send her love to Mr.
                        Griffin as her mother might be wanting it. Saturday evening Mr. Morton at
                        the Neighborhood Group gave an interesting talk on the romance of Ritual.
                        Saw Bergner in "Escape Me Never." She is a great actress though she hasn't
                        the voice of a Bernhardt. Are these same pictures running in India? It's
                        worth seeing though you wouldn't get the same kind of satisfaction out of it
                        that I did. It's the story of a genius and his gypsy wife!!! The Morton's
                        lost out on getting the Cheong house <note>for the Rev. Cheong Cheok
                        Hong</note> and they deserved to with their silly dickering. Friends of the
                        Johnston's have taken it. Mr. Morton said he is doing good business with the
                        Anthro books and will have to be getting more of them.</p>

                        which the Deans took me in their car was a great success. Streams of people,
                        lovely day, everybody pleased and satisfied, hundreds of people and in the
                        end some 50 people turned back without coming down when they saw the long
                        line ahead of them and the slow movement.</p>

                    <p>8 November, 1935 Delhi - (A Waiting Room in Delhi Junction Station)<lb/> Dear
                        Ula (Maddocks from Ronald Craig), Instead of Saturday morning last, the
                        "Chitral" got in at Bombay at 11 p.m. the previous night. There was a large
                        crowd down to meet the Australian cricketers. I was a one man team to meet a
                        one man team and our greeting was considerably the more extensive in time
                        and intensity. Before midnight we were sitting in chairs to review the
                        present situation of the universe, - Steiner or Krishnaji? We got away from
                        them both. It was Walter Burley Griffin and an aggressive delighted
                        listener. A moment later the deck hands were making a preliminary survey for
                        their mop work. On the nearest clock tower that moment proved to be five
                        hours. I went to my hotel near the wharf and turned in an hour before
                        sunrise. Three hours later I went down to the boat again. We got through the
                        customs and walked along to my hotel. Here we resumed our discussion which
                        the absurdity of sleep had interrupted. But after a couple of hours a
                        conscience clutched me. A builder of cities was sitting under an indoor
                        punkha when the jabberwocky panorama of Bombay was futilely beckoning to
                        him. So we got up and went to Cooks on my bashful initiative. During the
                        stroll around there Bombay had its chance but it never looked a winner. The
                        things on which India's second largest municipality prides itself were
                        accepted as the bread and butter of architectural diet. The sweets of the
                        meal were castigated as unwholesome and nasty. But the genius of the pont
                        was still shameless as we walked into the tourist bureau. Behind the counter
                        was a clerk in charge of railway bookings. For a minute we sat and feigned
                        interest in his time-table researches. Then some decorative posters
                        suggested how Muslim monotheism had tortured the fecundity of Hindu
                        poly-cum-monotheism. It was a great cultural opportunity for the clerk too
                        but he spent the next one and a half hours in a comfortable</p>

                        Anthroposophical Society; "Krishnaji" is a name commonly used to refer to
                        Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986), who was for a time associated with Annie
                        Besant (1847-1933) and the Theosophical Society.</note>

                    <p>reverie on the pretext that Cooks paid him to give clients their head.
                        Meanwhile I plucked the strings of the harp with clumsy conversational
                        fingers while the unmanageable instrument nevertheless yielded a smooth and
                        steady melody of thought. (My prompt notes were from "One and Many" to be
                        found in "Do What You Will" whose author, Aldous Huxley, was anathema to the
                        harp. So does the violin chafe against the bow.)</p>
                    <p>Bombay lay all uninspected, choked up with cheap pride, as we hurried back to
                        be last for lunch at the hotel. The waiter served us with everything on a
                        sufficiently extensive menu. We told him we were vegetarians but he must
                        have thought we would never be fanatical about such matters as I recall
                        dallying with fish and chicken bones. I am not sure now what was digesting
                        within us as we went to the lift for upstairs and our bedrooms, connected by
                        a common bathroom. We veered into one of these rooms and I was the little
                        artisan helping the masterbuilder to erect ever more permanent theses when a
                        waiter tried to thrust us in twain with an afternoon tea-tray. We pacified
                        this irritant intruder in the easiest way by consuming what he had brought.
                        This kept the body going for another listening bout of a quarter of a tin of
                        cigarettes' duration.</p>
                    <p>An unseen Bombay was growing dark. We were establishing our next thesis in a
                        bus bound for Malabar Hill and the master builder took his eye off the work
                        to make some unmalicious but wholly unappreciative comments on the
                        environment sliding by. From the foot we walked to the top of Malabar Hill
                        and looked down on the lights of the city. What had been ignored or had
                        produced indifference now received a verbal caress or so which it should
                        have valued had it known the real authority of the one who gave them. But
                        the talk turned to the peculiarities of clients and the necessity of
                        chastening their unaesthetic ambitions and giving them what they really
                        wanted without their knowing it. We were, not unnaturally, the last to
                        commence dinner after we had found a bus to carry a continuing conversation
                        back to</p>
                    <pb n="26"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 26 ====]</p>
                    <p>its hotel site.</p>
                    <p>Next morning we made a mock inspection of Victoria Gardens. But while the
                        masterbuilder had seemed blandly unaware of buildings without meaning, about
                        'birds and beasts and flowers' - particularly the last - he was singularly
                        perspicacious and I tried to learn a pack of relative facts concerning the
                        flora of the land I had loitered in unobservantly for over a couple of
                        years. On this Sunday afternoon we took a boat across the harbour to the
                        island that has the Elephants caves on whose walls are Hindu sculpturing.
                        Bombay's Harbour won golden opinions and the city should have blushed a
                        little at praise it had been unable to earn the previous day. In the caves I
                        found the richest aesthetic satisfaction I have found in India. To my
                        instructor they were not this but something that contained many of the
                        rudiments of good architecture. I remember that his camera shutter clicked a
                        lot and that has since proved a sure sign of his favouring appraisal. I
                        could have written this letter about those sculpture pieces but my reader
                        (assuming that she has borne with me to this point) must be told more of
                        Walter Burley Griffin's response to India.</p>
                    <p>Dear Vishnu! but Walter Burley Griffin has seen things! We have had
                        phenomenally good luck. In five or six days there has been a feast that I
                        believe would exhaust the digestive powers, nay, shatter the gravity, of any
                        living architect that I can imagine other than him. If I had his perception
                        of the whole architectural significance I should be suffering from high
                        blood pressure in the region of the mind. But he is sitting at the same
                        table, filling my pad with a pen, and within coo-ee of an unexamined New
                        Delhi which will presently be submitted to the closest and most balanced
                        scrutiny that will have occurred in its life. What has happened between
                        Delhi and Bombay I can't describe now. If it had been less eventful I would
                        have had a shot at it, but as it is I can only enumerate.</p>

                    <p>idea of going to Agra. On Monday night at Khansi we marked that the next stop
                        would be Gwalior. Mr. Griffin looked edgy and infinitely acquisitive about
                        the name. I remembered that Malati Patwharden's sister, a school friend of
                        Komalam's, is the wife of the principal of a college there for princes. I
                        had a chat with the station master and as a result of his information we
                        broke our journeying and camped in the waiting room for the short balance of
                        the night. In the early morning I rang the Fort and got on to Pierce, the
                        school principal. He was the best host we could possibly have had. He is
                        keenly interested in architectural values, knew the worth of what he was
                        living amidst and steered us well.</p>
                    <p>When he saw us off at night he was under the spell of Walter Burley Griffin.
                        His wife, Ansuya, was the first specimen of unsophisticated but effortlessly
                        cultured Indian womanhood that Walter Burley Griffin had met and it was a
                        good meeting. There was also a young Bengal artist whose work I drank in
                        very hungrily, and who won more terse valuable appreciation from my senior
                        companion also. The glories of Gwalior are not for this letter but I believe
                        that they will stand out in anything that he is writing. The next piece of
                        architecture that we inhabited was the second class waiting room at the Agra
                        Cantonment station. We were in it for a sleeping night and Walter Burley
                        Griffin approved its structure with slight occasional snores, while I smoked
                        and thought.</p>

                    <p>TAJ - I looked inquiringly at him after the first long glance. "It is not to
                        be criticized," he said. But I could write a letter on what he did say. I
                        now felt that I could discuss the Taj with more pith borrowed from him than
                        anyone I am likely to meet for some time yet. But you must take it as read
                        without my even suggesting it here. The Agra Fort again proved to be a
                        collection of marvels. But I was at the side of sane, deliberate, cautious
                        approval. From Agra on Wednesday we went to Akhbar's abandoned capital,
                        Fatephur Sikri, and again used a station waiting room as a hotel. But before
                        we slept</p>

                    <p>the khansame made us some food and waited up for our return as we circulated
                        parts of the city in the moonlight. There were jackals amongst the ruins
                        which were very little decayed - only empty. Everything in it brought the
                        swiftest pleasure to Walter Burley Griffin who found it an intelligently
                        planned city of beautiful ingredients. On our return he seemed to sleep very
                        well on what he had seen.</p>
                    <p>We spent the bulk of the morrow's daylight in the city. He was tireless and
                        brought the total of camera exposures up to 80 since landing. After five
                        hours of inspection in an only moderately lenient sun, I sped for retreat to
                        a refreshment house. We had had tea and biscuits and nothing since. He
                        said:- "With age it is the eyes that hamper one (He was looking at a
                        guide-book plan of the city) but with youth it is the tummy." I parried with
                        - "But my hindrance can be remedied." And so it was. But he was dreaming of
                        town-planning for Akhbar while he drank his tea. And we got up to spend
                        three more hours seeing what has been done in that way. I enjoyed them all,
                        but in him it touched a conscious depth that I cannot unclose. We got back
                        to Agra at night (last night) under a three quarter moon. The spell was on
                        us for an hour and a half and then we walked forcibly out of it. Where to? A
                        cinema show. The Begum's tomb floated behind the screen. Why indeed is Bing
                        Crosby? During the day we had seen a city charged with art in every quarter.
                        And here was a man singing a babyish squall as though it too had a faint
                        savour of art. The pretense was too thin, but the egregious Bing went right
                        on full of an asinine sincerity that is bred only a long way to the West.
                        There was a girl in the film supposed to be a princess but she was really a
                        mannequin without knowing it, a mannequin's soul, body, clothes and acting
                        art. I smoked the program through in I hope not too sullen a contempt. I
                        believe there is no art with such infinite possibilities as the cinema, but
                        at present it is a slobbering babe.</p>

                    <p>8 November, 1935 Delhi. - from Walter Burley Griffin - Marion dearest. The
                        Vice-Chancellor of Lucknow University had suggested to Mr. Craig that I
                        might see things on my way so we have only this morning reached our last
                        way-station here. The journey has been just one succession of thrills.
                        Bombay, the most enterprising of Indian Cities, did not excite much
                        sight-seeing on my part after having sat up yarning with Mr. Craig on the
                        Chitral until 4:30 A.M. Saturday. So we did not do much but use our tram and
                        bus excursions around town for continuing our conversations. Sunday however
                        we spent on a boat excursion to the ancient rock temples of Elephanta which
                        are on an island in the wonderfully beautiful Bay of Bombay which is of the
                        character and equal in charm to anything we saw in the South Pacific
                        tropics, and wholly unspoilt. The old Hindu sculpture is stately and the
                        architectural ensemble grandly impressive and refined as well. These smaller
                        caves were so satisfactory that I left for some other time the greater ones
                        at Ellora (Architecture) and Agunta <note>Ajunta</note> (Painting) which
                        would have required lengthy side trips taking several days.</p>
                    <p>Routed via Agra and Delhi we made our first stop-over after a night and a day
                        on the train passing through rich and varied country both jungle and
                        cultivated, the latter with black soil and endless cornfields (maize) verily
                        like Illinois. That stop-over was a tremendous sensation, the vast Hindu
                        fortress and palace of Gwalior, deserted except for the school of an
                        Englishman married to a Brahmin who were known to Mr. Craig, the only other
                        Englishman similarly married and with offspring. The Pearces took us into
                        their modified Indian home life on this citadel, and the perfect day was all
                        too short for the several temples and vast palaces of the lofty battlemented
                        plateau. Besides these there were innumerable carvings in the pink sandstone
                        cliffs (just like those of Castlecrag) and these were</p>
                    <pb n="30"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 30 ====]</p>
                    <p>of the ancient Jain culture and quite distinct from Hindu sculpture,
                        free-standing human figures of a form and severity like Egyptian and ranging
                        from diminutive to colossal, 40 feet at a guess.</p>
                    <p>The next sensation, after another night on the train and in station
                        waiting-rooms with the most successful rubber bed, was the Taj Mahal in the
                        morning sun-light. To me this was no less breath-taking than to any devotee
                        who has ever sung its praises, and quite independent of the fact that,
                        architecturally, I could see many things that should have been altogether
                        different. The pure fresh sparkling crystalline Italian marble, like white
                        Angaston, South Australia, or Georgia, U.S.A., with the delicious graded
                        shadows of its vast rounded concave and convex niches and domes present a
                        perennially youthful spirit to the soul.</p>
                    <p>A day later - Last night after a stroll of an hour and a half on the
                        terraces, daises, lawns, parterres and water gardens; and amongst the
                        luxurious and heavily scented trees, and in the moonlight, we found some
                        particular points of view that met every requirement of the architectural
                        imagination even. One of these was from the inner side of the base of a
                        corner minaret putting the multiple arches between the massive pylons and
                        eliminating the neck-like drum of the dome. Another was from the trees at
                        one side of the vast Persian Garden where the general proportions of the
                        monument were masked and the imagination allowed to form a vast Arabian
                        concept. Another was looking across the central marble platform of the
                        garden with the eye exactly level therewith so that a long marble stylobate
                        was added to the foreshortened Mahal together with its four minarets.
                        Unfortunately none of these aspects could ever be photographed even in the
                        daylight. But they served to show how no merely architectural considerations
                        of static balance of forces could apply to the "most beautiful building in
                        the world."</p>
                    <p>The vast castle palace of Agra where the Hindu architecture of</p>
                    <note>A "stylobate" is the platform on which columns rest, the 'floor' of a
                        temple.</note>

                    <p>Gwalior had been translated into Islamic terms contemporaneously was a whole
                        tour of India in itself but Wednesday had also other things for us. We had
                        afternoon "tiffin", Indian fashion, in the home of one of the patriots who
                        has spent altogether ten years in jail with lesser terms for all his family
                        as well as another of the martyrs who was present. Then we went by train to
                        the Fatephur Sikri <note>Fatehpur Sikri</note> and after an hour's ride were
                        able to explore in the moonlight and suddenly come upon the vast pyramid of
                        steps leading to the mighty arch portal of the Jami Mashid behind which for
                        miles extended the virtually intact palatial section of the completed Moghul
                        Capital City of the Emperor Akbar in the 16th Century. Though the only
                        inhabitants at that time of day were jackals whom we both heard and saw, we
                        were soon followed in by two would-be guides from the Fatephur village lying
                        in front of and below the city. We left before midnight because of their
                        warnings that the jackals would thereafter be in packs, but the impression
                        of splendor and vastness of the red sandstone city thus gained was only
                        enhanced by the explorations during the whole of the following day through
                        agoras, caravansaries, fortifications, waterworks, innumerable vaulted and
                        elaborately decorated baths, stepped terraces, five storied pavilions,
                        successive enclosed colonnaded and arcade courts, walls, water gardens,
                        mosques, minarets, galleries, balconies, passageways, and the public and
                        private quarters of the Mogul, his Queens, Courtiers, Nobles and followers
                        elaborately carved, inlaid and screened with delicately filigreed stone
                        panels. Equally elaborate were enormous stables for their horses, and still
                        more extensive the housing of camels and elephants, throughout with floors
                        and roofs as well as walls of dressed red sandstone.</p>
                    <p>How altogether pusillanimous, puny was the effort of the Civilization of
                        Australia toward a Continental Capital compared with this perfectly
                        conceived and as perfectly completed monumentally, and then</p>

                        about Canberra. But those were the energetic times of Elizabeth whose
                        ambassador was at Fatepur-Sikri <note>Fatehpur Sikri</note>. I am taking
                        advantage of 24 hours delay in the Air Mail to get this interim impression
                        across to you without benefit of the carbon copy the tablet for which is
                        just now buried in the inaccessible recesses of the bag in the cloak room as
                        a result of reshifts to facilitate our side excursions. Lovingly your minus

                    <p>12 November, 1935 - Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin
                        - It would be quite impossible to keep minutes on my carbon pad of a
                        fraction of the impressions I have gained thus far in India. They would be
                        abstracted to the degree of platitudes. However I think most of them are
                        deep enough to keep until I get home. Though my contacts are quite
                        superficial and the difference of language sets up an effective barrier yet
                        I believe I already feel more <hi rend="ul">at home with these people</hi>
                        than I was for many years in Australia, and the soldiers seem to be the only
                        antipathetic ingredient.</p>
                    <p>We arrived here Monday morning after three days in Delhi of the same perfect
                        conditions that have obtained throughout the trip, and were met by Mr.
                        Alagappan at the station. This hotel which I hope to leave today for a more
                        economical boarding house, is only less luxurious than the Swiss Hotel where
                        we stopped one day or so at Delhi. The private rooms are arranged around U
                        shaped garden court yards and consist of two stories of arcaded verandas
                        with lounge bed room in front and dressing room and modern bath room at the
                        back. In Delhi there were four rooms in each suite and the luggage was
                        delivered into the dressing room at the back. The modern sections of all
                        these cities are parklike areas of magnificent distances, tree-vaulted
                        avenues, walled or balustraded gardens acres in area, with stepped
                        balustraded flat roofs on massive plastered walls with rich arched and
                        linteled decorative openings and grills usually tinted a delightful ecru
                        with white trim.</p>

                    <p>"New Delhi", which might better be called X Delhi for it is the tenth new
                        Capital City of India in this same locality in as many centuries, two Hindu,
                        six Muslim, two British, is the newest of the cities such as I have
                        described, with more uniform and Roman character of buildings, and with
                        roadways with great lawn parkways and handsome avenue trees of selected
                        types of considerable variety, mostly unfamiliar to me. It is almost
                        perfectly flat but planned with many monumental terminal vistas and has
                        already attained completeness and finished elegance though there is of
                        course much construction work going on in the business and residential
                        sections.</p>
                    <p>The long wide walk with reflecting canals and many fountains and the
                        governmental terrace with vast stone buildings and several domes and
                        extensive colonnades effectively massed is essentially Roman even to the
                        togas of the statues of the Viceroys despite the efforts to supply local
                        color in all the details. Except for the luxuriant verdure of the avenues
                        however the pre-European capitals, the ruins of which extend continuously
                        for some thirteen miles in each direction, must have been even more
                        magnificent and certainly more imaginative and romantic, and the more
                        ancient they are the more architecturally satisfying.</p>
                    <p>The landscape is studded with domes of ancient temples and tombs amongst the
                        terraces and castle walls in all stages of decrepitude. Much of the latest
                        and most refined Mohammedan architecture is in and around Delhi, still well
                        preserved. The rather small walled city is overcrowded, perhaps specially so
                        because of the intensive building activity of the late years at Delhi, and
                        its bazaars or narrow streets are squalid. Lucknow on the other hand is
                        largely a modern city with amply wide streets and more substantial stuccoed
                        buildings throughout. The older part along the river dating from the
                        eighteenth century is now, after the Sepoy Rebellion <note>Indian Rebellion
                            of 1857</note>, marked only by elaborate mosques and palaces whose style
                        compared with earlier</p>

                    <p>Moghul is like Rococo compared with Renaissance. The University is on the
                        site of one of these rulers' palaces with some remnants preserved as
                        historic monuments. Wide open and parklike spaces mark the sites of the old
                        bazaars or commercial areas. The present city extends for miles to the
                        southward and contains some recent ambitious but uninteresting buildings
                        such as the Legislative Assembly, the Post Office and some Cinemas by our
                        acquaintance of the visit to London, Mr. Lanchester. One of the large
                        hostels of the University is also by him but undistinguishable from the
                        other buildings which are identical in character with Channing College as
                        illustrated in <note>James</note> Fergusson's "Indian Architecture" or
                        "Modern Architecture" I forget which, completely without interest.</p>
                    <p>Graceful bulbous domes are everywhere throughout the University proper and
                        the more elaborate Medical Department some miles down the river. In fact
                        domes and minarets play the same part in the landscape around here that
                        "eggs and darts" play in Renaissance buildings. I struck a couple of
                        holidays on arrival so have not yet got down to tin tacks on the library but
                        at the moment I am studying the whole problem of the future of the
                        University for the purpose of a general plan to see if I cannot meet the
                        objections to the original site which are grounded on fear that the space
                        will be needed for future extension of the Laboratories of the science
                        buildings. I am installed with table in the Physics Building and quite
                        probably may have to make a change in the design for our building since the
                        first one is quite unsuitable for the alternative site. Walter</p>

                        no let-up in the destructive forces of government so I don't see how there
                        could be any real turn for the better. However Pynor hopes to get started
                        through his father's clientele and of course slum building continues. He
                        landed in Perth just after you had passed through. Said there was quite a

                        interesting points. At least half the people there were unknown to me. Mrs.
                        Walker said it was an inspiring evening. Mrs. Lightband, who is inclined to
                        be antagonistic toward her husband's interest in Anthroposophy, was there
                        and Miss Drummond told me she said she began to realize there was something
                        she could learn there, etc. I am to give two more, next Wednesday and the
                        one following. Thursday evening there was a Castlecrag prenuptial welcome
                        party at Johnston's to Mr. Stoker and his fiancee Phyllis. Everybody has
                        been saying "What a jolly party it was," the Johnstons themselves, I think,
                        being quite amazed that it could be so without booze. I supplied the
                        ice-cream.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Maddocks came up shortly after your letter from Delhi arrived and we
                        read it together and thought it most wonderful. With a guide like Mr. Craig
                        your opportunities are exceptional. Moonlight! You'll remember that's the
                        way I first saw Rome and Venice with Gerald <note>MMG's brother</note>. This
                        helps me to picture what you are experiencing. A dreadful thing has happened
                        at Castlecrag. Little six year old Charles Morton died yesterday. Taken sick
                        Thursday evening, he was taken to Dr. Rivett's hospital at midnight. Not
                        sure of his diagnosis Dr. Rivett called in another doctor. They operated and
                        found the bowel had pushed through a rupture and would not function, poisons
                        had accumulated and weakened the Heart and he did not recover. I had a
                        curious dream Thursday</p>

                    <p>night which I mulled over for some time because it seemed as if it must have
                        some significance. After I learned what had happened I felt sure it must
                        have been in the nature of seeing into the future which as we know does not
                        break down the fact of free will. I saw a great burden of blackness fall on
                        a group of human beings and they went down under it like ninepins. And then
                        a cry went up over the death of children as if that was more than could be
                        endured, perhaps the heaviest burden one could have to bear.</p>
                    <p>Miss Drummond had a letter from the West Australia Anthros. On her advice the
                        twelve members have resigned from the St. John group of Sydney and have
                        formed a West Australia Group under the leadership of Mr. Gianoni. They were
                        very disappointed not to see you en route and want to be surely notified
                        when you are returning, but you'll be coming back by the way of Java won't
                        you? I think it would be silly of you not to and for goodness sake don't be
                        silly. Thursday Bim Hilder and Roma Hopkins are to be married in a little
                        chapel in the Scout's reserve no one but the parents attending. I am invited
                        to the reception at Roma's mother's in the evening. They are a lovely
                        couple. Bim will be building a home in Castlecrag next door to Tilly's. He
                        is using your Jones two level plan. Am glad you are the champion adventurer.

                        obtained his degree at Glasgow University with honors in Town Planning. He

                        United Provinces. All his conventions are of Indian and Muslim forms and,
                        though, from the work he showed me, he is obviously a capable and

                        built. That is how he accomplishes his immense turnover. His progenitors
                        have been engineers and builders and his whole family have earned
                        distinction of one sort or another in these lines, following his father who
                        was chief engineer for one of the Indian railways before he retired to his
                        School for Overseers of Construction.</p>
                    <p>He has promised to supply me with test data of reinforced brickwork and other
                        local methods and materials. Sand comes from a distance and so does stone,
                        hence brickwork in cement mortar is laid and reinforced in the same way as
                        concrete even to two-way reinforcing of slabs. Brickwork in ordinary houses
                        is laid in mud. Plastering of walls and roofs has been done for ages of
                        hydraulic lime burned to a pinkish yellow and applied holus bolus. Houses
                        cost 4 rupees per square foot or less, and this young architect's estimate
                        for our Library was 7 rupees for both floors together! Bricks are 8 rupees
                        per thousand delivered. Altogether building costs are not more than one
                        third Australian costs for equivalent work. The Treasurer of Benares
                        University wants me to plan some cheap housing for some of their lands.</p>

                    <p>28 November, 1935 - 15 Station Road, Lucknow. - These are busy days with me
                        but whenever my thoughts are free they revert to little Charles. Where will
                        he find again such a mother perfected in every way, also such playmates, and
                        such guidance as yours? I can only think from the impression he has left
                        with me that he may have been so far advanced that he needed only a brief
                        experience for some purpose of karma. His parents still have another
                        remarkable individuality in Ivor who will be the recompense for their
                        sacrifice no doubt but to have to forego, all at once, the joy and
                        association with Charles cannot but be terrible for them just now. It is
                        grievous enough for those of us who had little more than the privilege of
                        seeing him about. Your letter received on Sunday morning the 24th was a
                        welcome birthday greeting. Saturday afternoon I attended the annual
                        convocation of Isabella Thoburn College started by her 50 years ago with
                        four students, young women, in a room under American Methodist auspices and
                        now occupying</p>

                    <p>the highest place among the institutions of Northern India, for the higher
                        education of women. It is affiliated with the University which affords some
                        of its laboratory facilities to Science students and confers the degrees.
                        According to the annual report there are 172 students in residence in the
                        palatial quadrangle which must enclose an area of 15 acres at least.</p>
                    <p>The most interesting feature of the program however was the presentation of
                        Sophocles' Antigone from a platform of the arcaded quadrangle to an audience
                        under a tent marque or pavilion. The chorus was clothed in robes of steel
                        blue and white and the only Caucasian (American) was the leading female
                        character Antigone. Compared with your production of the same play in the
                        valley theatre the manipulation of the groups was clumsy but the stage
                        afforded scant opportunity and there had been drastic curtailment of
                        rehearsals, the original master mind and producer having left the college
                        for a position elsewhere, and this was the first time anything of this sort
                        had been attempted.</p>
                    <p>The choruses however chanted their lines to beautiful and appropriate music,
                        written in America, but accompanied by a concealed piano which should have
                        been a harp. The leading characters were successfully rendered though the
                        young lady who was the King had taken the role in an emergency only eight
                        days before. I thought the performance of Antigone extremely beautiful and
                        the lines given to that character are certainly inspiring. Most of what I
                        have told of the circumstances of this production I learned on the occasion
                        of my visit to the college the following Tuesday when I talked on
                        Anthroposophy for 45 minutes from 1 P.M. to a group studying comparative
                        religions. I shall not soon forget the scene when I turned into the southern
                        cloister with the girls passing to and fro from their class rooms in their
                        fresh tinted saris in the morning sunlight, such a scene as could be
                        imagined only of ancient Greece. One of the Science Doctors with whom I

                    <p>each day in the tower of the Chemistry Building, when I enquired about Indian
                        plays as you requested said that there are as yet none of the Indian plays
                        done properly into English except Tagore of which (1) Sacrifice, (2)
                        Waterfall and (3) The Dark Chamber are favorable examples. Probably these
                        are already available in Sydney. Another of the Chemistry lecturers gave two
                        public lectures on "Alchemy" this week the first of which dealt,
                        superficially of course, with the ancient art in India and Europe. The
                        second however was a very able and lucid exposition of the accomplishments
                        in England, Germany, France, Italy and America through which, by electrical
                        disintegration of the nucleus, 41 of the elements have now been transmuted
                        and astonishingly (astonishing to those not familiar with Anthroposophy)

                    <p>2 December 1935 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin. -
                        I am sorry to be missing Dr. Steiner's cycle on the Bhagavad Gita, the
                        discussions and Miss Drummond's comments thereon. I greatly enjoyed the
                        rendering you posted me. I like your reports of the activities of the St.
                        John Group after the Sydney exodus. It may eventuate that that event was the
                        first necessity. Forming a new group of the West Australians is another of
                        Miss Drummond's master strokes. Give my felicitations and congratulations to
                        Bim on his conquest of Roma. I have been rereading some of your newsy
                        letters before I could part with them for Gene's benefit. It is hard to
                        realize that so much of vital interest and importance can have happened in
                        and about Castlecrag in so short a time. Wherever you are however that is
                        the case.</p>
                    <p>We are still unsettled as to the site of the Library though I think the
                        committee is gradually getting committed to my revised plan for the original
                        site undoubtedly the better site and a much improved plan. There will be a
                        grand rush with the working drawings and specifications for which I shall
                        have the help of a draftsman for we are still planning to complete them and
                        then travel to Benares, Calcutta, Madras and various points south before the
                        Moldavia leaves Colombo.</p>
                    <p>I have made a new discovery solving the sightseeing problem of Lucknow. I can
                        rent a bicycle for three pice - 5 cents - per hour. The site is level and
                        the roads are hard and the exercise is less than that required to drive a
                        motor car, so I get about whenever I find time by day or by moonlight. The
                        only disagreeable feature is the dust which is less than by any other
                        conveyance or even in staying home and that is about the same as in Illinois
                        in Summer. It should be much worse considering that for nine months it never
                        rains, but by some dispensation of Providence in this favored peninsula it
                        is not. Sunday with the landlady's son and another boarder from Calcutta we
                        did the North West corner of the City which from the point of view of the
                        Jani Mahid (Mosque) is a perfect Arabian</p>

                    <p>Night's dream of white domes and minarets. (Site of the All India Exposition
                        of which more later.)</p>
                    <p>This evening I saw the Martiniere College, the building erected by the French
                        soldier who became a British General after the French had been defeated and
                        who was offered $5,000,000 for this magnificent creation by the reigning
                        Nawab at the beginning of the 19th Century. It is in no sense Indian but is
                        a grander conception than the French palaces of those days of magnificence
                        of Versailles and Fontainebleau. It is more impressive in composition and is
                        rich with multitudinous exterior sculptured groups and figures. His
                        endowment had provided the leading school for Europeans in India, in the
                        institutions at Lucknow and Calcutta, also an institution of similar scale
                        at his home town of Lyons. The other endowed schools or privately supported
                        institutions I have come across are those of the Americans for the Indians
                        themselves. The Isabella Thoburn College previously mentioned is one of the
                        three institutions of higher learning that united to form Lucknow
                        University, the remaining two being of Indian origin supported by
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Please ask Mr. Nicholls to post by Air Mail Mittler's fuel stove catalogue
                        from which I selected Winter's cook stove, also particulars of Winter's
                        service water heater from Fox. The wasteful and smoky way of cooking on open
                        coke and wood fires is seriously affecting the planning of otherwise well
                        appointed houses in India. Walter</p>
                    <p>P.S. The Vice Regal visit came off without incident. There was no cheering on
                        the part of the populace (whose average income is a pound a year) but there
                        was lavish display of decorations, illumination and fireworks on the part of
                        the subsidiary rulers. The most interesting features of the illuminations
                        were the curtain of vertical strung lamps in one of the archways opened up
                        for the passage of the motor car, the lighting of the foliage of the avenue
                        trees by concealed lights within amongst the branches and by colored balls

                        This ancient practice makes the hard electric bulbs appear very mechanical
                        and quite unsuitable for combination with the suffused flickering glow which
                        gives the illusion of liquid stones to the walls. For the rest the
                        illuminations were as garish as the Columbia Fair <note>World's Columbian

                    <p>11 December, 1935 - 15 Station Road, Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion
                        Mahony Griffin. Sorry to hear that Pynor is not fully recovered in health
                        but surely Australia will be better for his trouble than Europe. As to my
                        next incarnation I cannot think of anything better in this poor old world
                        than the job I am now on though I fear the fixed star of my entelechy did
                        not indicate that. My physical appearance does not suggest much of the
                        Indian but I have a hunch that much of my architectural predilections must
                        have come from Indian experience. This does not mean that the environment
                        here provides satisfaction so much as that it provides stimulus and motifs
                        for satisfactory imagination. Louis Sullivan found his stimulus in Saracenic
                        architecture and may have reincarnated from a Moorish experience to give it
                        adequate expression. His appearance would support such an hypothesis even if
                        mine does not suggest the Indian.</p>
                    <p>I have been given a copy of a document printed by the Government at the press
                        of Thomason College, Roorkee, entitled;- Design for Lucknow University,
                        prepared by Sir Edwin L. Lutyens R.A. Architect. Foundation Stone Laid on
                        19th March 1921, by His Excellency the Hon'ble Sir Spencer Harcourt Butler
                        K.C.S.I. CTE. Governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, First
                        Chancellor of the University.</p>
                    <p>The precious document represents an effort equivalent to two and a half days
                        of our staff at 49 Park Street Sydney provided it</p>

                    <p>could take a holiday from thinking for that length of time. The building
                        plans do not correspond with the ground plan and the elevations are without
                        doors or windows, or shades or shadows. With a few of the adjustments of the
                        machines, that du Pont factory at Elizabeth, New Jersey, could do half the
                        plans and elevations which could then be folded for blue printing the other
                        half. The pattern is pure Roman from Letarouilly ("Edifices de Rome
                        Moderne"). This scientific architecture was applied to Lucknow without
                        reference to the world or the sun or the air above nor the water beneath the
                        earth, recking <note>i.e., taking into account</note> not of man nor his
                        works, his knowledge, nor resources. Nothing but the "idees fixes" in his
                        authoritative Ego were granted admission. He was here in the cold season
                        which is why (I am told by Prof. McMahon) there is no consideration of the
                        hot sun in summer and thus the buildings are squares mostly on the
                        diagonals, inappropriate for this hot climate, or circuses such as we use
                        for sunbathing because they both afford no shade in the middle of the day.</p>
                    <p>He chose a site, not where the huge Medical Department was already
                        established nor yet where the Academic Departments were in operation,
                        several miles to the East, both in elaborate housing, nor yet where there
                        was unoccupied expanse, as there was alongside, but astride a main road of
                        North and South traffic and also astride the river withal destroying one
                        bridge for one purpose and submitting another for only a University
                        connection. He was here in the dry season so he chose a site of low level
                        which was altogether under 21 feet of water at the next periodic flood of
                        1923. The conditions in Lucknow are on all fours with Canberra. The river is
                        dammed to a certain extent so that it can be used for boating, and
                        especially for domestic laundry purposes in this country as in France. But
                        it is not dammed sufficiently to provide an impounded area such as is
                        required for a flood so there are large valley areas subject to occasional
                        inundation and unsuitable for civic utilization. You may recall that most of

                        half lakhs, Rupees 150,000, which equals $75,000. This is not the whole

                    <p>Like all others the world over, my clients are inclined to hang onto the
                        things they know until fully satisfied that another way is better in every
                        respect. However the Library Committee, forming the first hurdle of the new
                        design, was surmounted in a meeting, almost unanimous, yesterday afternoon
                        after a satisfactory interview thereon with the Vice Chancellor who is the
                        resident head, the Chancellor being the Governor of the Province, Sir Harry
                        Haig. The next vital hurdle will be the engineer of the Province who is
                        expected back from a trip Saturday next. He can approve or disapprove or
                        order amendments under the delightful system of checks and balances of
                        Parliamentary Governmental form. After him the Executive Council called by
                        the Vice Chancellor for the 16th instant and then the Building Committee. It
                        is hoped to be ready to lay a foundation stone in February and complete the
                        building for one and a half lakhs in the course of a year thereafter. The
                        Librarian expressed concern that I did not intend to supervise the erection.
                        Possibly he may want me back sometime or other in the construction stage in
                        connection with the ornamentation but when he counts the cost he is bound to
                        be satisfied with a proxy.</p>

                        newspaper in North India, who is about to have built for him a modern
                        establishment by a contractor other than Mr. Alagappan, and who is financing
                        the venture at a cost equaling the Library.</p>
                    <p>I am just in receipt of a characteristic breezy letter from father written
                        only just before leaving November 7 for Auckland where he must be by now.
                        This is his farewell visit which I trust has precedents in those of Adelina
                        Patti and Dame Melba for against these</p>
                    <note>Adelina Patti and Dame Nellie Melba (an Australian) were famous opera

                    <p>is only apparent the law of averages, a principle which really is reliable
                        only for insurance companies and not for their "risks."</p>
                    <p>I have already promised Mr. Alagappan that I will stop over in Calcutta a
                        while beyond the limit of my excursion ticket as he thinks it will be
                        necessary in consequence of the delays here. He is angling for an opening at
                        the University in Bengal, wants to submit a commercial building design in a
                        competition somewhere and says that several Nawak <note>nawab?</note>
                        palaces might have been accomplished in the time consumed by the discussions
                        over the Lucknow Library. These people so far as my experience goes now are
                        concerned with architecture in terms of symmetry and ornament and will not
                        readily subserve these features to mere dollars and cents. This works for a
                        consistent vogue to be sure but, as is becoming apparent, that vogue is not
                        necessarily reactionary. Particularly however it is not likely to become
                        purely mechanical and in that is the possibility of creating a demand for
                        our work if we were to establish a permanent office of European character
                        for an Indian clientele. But that would mean living here on the part of one
                        or the other of us. I shall not be in a position to judge better of this
                        prospect until after some experience in Calcutta which is the center of
                        modern India as well as the 2nd city of the British Empire if not as thickly
                        populated with practicing architects as some others. Hold on to Father until
                        I come. Merry Christmas when it comes and a successful play in the valley.

                    <p>17 December. 1935 - Walter Burley Griffin to Mrs. Ula Maddocks - India is a
                        lonesome place now and for a long time and will be the same tenfold for the
                        little wife and child of Ronald Craig after what has happened today. Last
                        night we were discussing my Sunday luncheon with the editor of "The Pioneer"
                        which Mr. Craig had been deterred from attending, also our trivial matters
                        of business and the happenings of the last three days that had passed since
                        I was with him Thursday. This afternoon I helped lower his coffin into the
                        grave in the beautiful</p>
                    <pb n="47"/>

                    <p>cemetery over the River to the North of the City. For me the blows were in
                        rapid succession, first the news yesterday noon that he was ill at the King
                        George Hospital, trouble undiagnosed, but an operation; second the sight of
                        him in the private ward all livid red and with blood-shot eyes yet withal
                        cheerful, thoughtful and practical in the waking periods from the morphine
                        injections found necessary to make his excruciating agony sufferable. He
                        said his trouble was an inflammation of liver and gall bladder, his nurse
                        gave a somewhat more indefinite account and the house surgeon insisting on
                        the need of immediate operation admitted to me that they would have to wait
                        until they had cut into the abdomen to find out which organ needed the
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>Not being able to reconcile the diagnosis with the remedy I went with Mr.
                        Alagappan and the Craig's next door neighbor who is the University Treasurer
                        to the house of the surgeon in charge to find out if nothing more could be
                        done in the diagnosis, suggesting consulting physician, X-ray, in addition
                        to blood and urine tests already made. He said that relief was so urgent all
                        medicines having failed and the continuing with morphine being so
                        undesirable, that it was not a case for a physician but for surgery and
                        unless the pain was reduced by the time of the next consciousness at six, he
                        would have to operate. Shortly after this we all went into the ward with the
                        surgeon who asked Mr. Craig about a certain sore spot on his arm, which was
                        a new development. He thereupon said it was no longer a question of
                        immediate operation but of calling in a physician which he did and we left
                        them in consultation in order to hunt for a private nurse for continuous
                        attendance. Under the latter circumstances Mrs. Craig was finally induced to
                        leave the patient with great reluctance. I only found thereafter that Mr.
                        Alagappan's insistence was based on a suspicion of smallpox which the
                        physician confirmed at 8 o'clock declaring the case to be homeroidal [sic]
                        or suppressed smallpox which is said to be</p>

                    <p>I was the first to whom this news was transmitted when Mr. Alagappan called
                        this morning to report that the death ensued at 12:15 this morning relieving
                        terrible agony and a fit of delirium. Earlier he had cried out in total
                        blindness for the lights to be turned on as how otherwise could he see his
                        baby. Yet two electric lights were glaring over his bed. The little wife has
                        been brave, almost stoical. Tomorrow the mother and child whom I had
                        expected to know so well leave for her father's home in Madras. Her
                        brilliant schoolmate, the History teacher in the Isabella Thoburn College,
                        has offered to travel with her tomorrow afternoon away from the Lucknow of
                        painful associations.</p>
                    <p>We have all lost a friend whose only fault was a great carelessness of his
                        own life and who bore his troubles with such fortitude that even those
                        around hardly suspected that there were any such things. He valued humanity
                        so much that he may have underrated the constituent element, the individual
                        Ego, and in his own case I feel sure that he carried this too far. Mr.
                        Alagappan has said many times that his capacities would make him a wealthy
                        man in two years if he would apply them to the contracting business which,
                        however, did not sufficiently engage his interest. Seemingly there are many
                        openings for imaginative enterprise here where new education is only
                        starting new demands. My sympathy goes to you for your loss of a far
                        longerstanding friendship. His last words were of his mother who he said
                        would be here now if he had let her know of his previous illness but under
                        the circumstances it was he thought perhaps as well that he had not let her
                        know. You will have heard the terrible fact of his loss by the cable sent
                        her today. Admittedly confluential smallpox baffles diagnosis. One of the
                        Physics staff told us this morning of the only case he knew of, that of a
                        young son of a Maharaja who brought the most eminent physicians of Bombay,
                        Delhi and two from Calcutta, giving their names, all of whom acknowledged
                        themselves completely</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 49 ====]</p>
                    <p>baffled. A servant then suggested an amateur follower of Hanneman
                            <note>Samuel Hahnemann?</note> who immediately named the disease and
                        prescribed two doses which immediately brought the eruptions to the surface
                        allowing the natural development to take place leading to recovery. It is
                        this that is unrecognized by the Allopathic School. I am glad therefore that
                        the Craigs exhausted the possibilities of Homeopathy available in the first
                        instance though the individual physician was unable within the limited time
                        to hit upon the real cause. As to what I might say to Ronald Craig's mother
                        when in Sydney the little mother said, "Tell her to come sometime to see the
                        child." His affection for his mother and solicitude for his family occupied
                        his mind. For himself he said he was happy and finally he had ten minutes of
                        peace and quiet after his violent delirium and died with a smile on his
                        face. Sincerely, Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>18 December, 1935, Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin.
                        What a harvest this great reaper is gathering from the fields we are in.
                        There must be something stirring on the other side just now, and these
                        fields are productive. The death of Ronald Craig cuts to the quick. We had
                        planned to live near each other adjoining the University under more flexible
                        and economic as well as more social conditions than has been possible for
                        either. There is always smallpox during the specific seasons of the
                        different sections of India each year and in the north its season is the
                        winter. For example there may be fifty cases in Lucknow now which are as a
                        rule under segregation and are not regarded as anything more serious than
                        most diseases.</p>
                    <p>Though Mr. Craig had not done much during the period of finding a home, he
                        had previously started and undertaken to complete a considerable course of
                        Steiner's works which might have graduated him from Krishnamurti (Vedanta)
                        as Krishnamurti graduated from Theosophy for him. Mr. Alagappan who has
                        thought much about such things agrees that Krishnamurti is teaching only
                        what he was taught as an Indian. When I read this morning your comparison of
                        the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita</p>
                    <note>"Allopathic School" in this context probably means conventional medical
                        treatment.</note>

                        the ultimate of the differentiated individualities which he had already come
                        to acknowledge as the essential difference of Western from Eastern religion.
                        In Mr. Craig's case the reversion to the Indian was not, in his opinion,
                        beneficial. But Ronald Craig was a lovable personality and his local Indian
                        friends and neighbors went to no end of trouble in his dire emergency though
                        they had only begun to know him.</p>

                    <p>Monday a solid three hours with the provincial Engineer, his deputy Colonel
                        Haig and the Librarian and Mr. Alagappan served to cover most of the points
                        of the Library design and intended construction that the authorities,
                        notwithstanding the "revolutionary nature" of both, agreed to the
                        "Experiment" subject to their satisfactory checking of the calculations and
                        the working out of the details as proposed by me. This affords the expert
                        backing as well as the legal authority necessary for the more timid of the
                        University Committeemen. One by one these latter are being committed
                        tactfully so that the remaining step up the executive Council in January
                        will be more or less formal ratifications. With due allowance for
                        "arriere-pensees" there is a remarkable contrast with my Australian official
                        experience.</p>

                    <p>24 December, 1935, Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                        A still week has passed since the swift tragedy of Ronald Craig, and five
                        days since I said goodbye to the sad-visaged widow and bright-faced infant
                        in the train bound for South India. In anticipation of an excursion next
                        week I have reloaded my camera. The excursion if it comes off is to a
                        Mohammadan wedding to which Mr. Alagappan and I are invited at Peshawar of
                        all places the most unlikely one for me to see in India;- beyond Baluchistan
                        in the North West frontier Province, at the Khyber pass: The frontier is
                        seven hundred miles away. The route traverses also Amritsar of the Golden
                        Temple and Taxila the vast city of disinterred foundations in successive
                        layers to 3,000 years ago and whose King Taxilles was Alexander's ally
                        against Portus.</p>
                    <p>Nothing has eventuated from my luncheon with the "Pioneer" editor, Mr. Young,
                        but my Indian doctor at the University dispensary, who has been dressing a
                        sore knuckle where I slid on it cycling, says that three wasteful social
                        engagements on each side must precede any business undertaking in India as
                        in Europe until the prevalence of rascality is reduced! This M.D. is a
                        sterling type who says from his experience that 90% of the Christian
                        Missionaries of which the Americans are the disinterested example have their
                        individual welfare first at heart though the other one tenth are superb. But
                        everyone has a missionary job with one person that is himself. The Bible
                        contains certain precepts which applied would solve all the world's problems
                        but to apply them is the only effective way to promulgate them and the
                        examples are very, very wanting. This is only a rough paraphrase of his
                        homely sentiment. Like the French in so many ways, these Hindus speak rapid
                        fire even in English and are hard to keep up with. But unlike some of the
                        students who buttonholed me to talk when photographing Harcourt Hotel this
                        morning, the little old doctor speaks from long and hard experience. The
                        students had with reason arrived at politics - Fascism, Communism and
                        Non-co-operation severally but were not unreceptive of what I thought</p>

                    <p>of these things and more inclined to admit that the ultimate must be a medium
                        way - the Threefold Commonwealth which is neither radical nor conservative
                        but correct, organic.</p>
                    <p>To revert to the American Christian missionaries for fear of doing them
                        injustice I must say that they have provided the foundation for a large, if
                        not the largest part, of the modern education of these parts which is the
                        first need of India, wherever it may lead to. They make no requirement of
                        conversion nor affiliation nor commitment of any sort but have afforded the
                        facilities of splendid institutions to all alike without inquiry. Needless
                        to say, the result of these good works may not be the Christianizing of the
                        heathens for which the contributions were exacted in Boston and Chicago. As
                        Isabella Thoburn College named after its first teacher is one of three large
                        factors in the Lucknow University and affords all the facilities for the
                        women, so is the Christian College named after its first master, whose name
                        I forget, the major factor in Allahabad University of whose students it
                        accounts for 2,000.</p>

                        Sing" and "Come all ye Faithful" a surprising and to me welcome alternative
                        to the harsh guttural and monotonous male singing that is now and almost

                        with the singing or at any rate with the baleful conch hour
                        <note>horn?</note> blowing that goes on intermittently in a nearby Hindu
                        Temple. The innumerable mosques are never out of sight in the streets and
                        lanes of Lucknow. The Hindu temples are of diminutive proportions and are
                        still, for the most part, almost inaccessibly secreted amongst the solid
                        masses of the houses as a result of a thousand years of persecution by the
                        Muslim conquerors. City noises of the Occidental sort are of a much lesser

                    <p>24 December, 1935, Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley
                        Griffin - What shocking, what dreadful word has come to us from India, the
                        death of Ronald Craig. Truly December was, in our circle, the terrible month
                        the astrologers have been telling us it would be. His letters to Mrs.
                        Maddocks have been most fascinating, delightful, quaint and appreciative. It
                        is hard indeed to accept these blows. As for the suggestion in your last of
                        the possibility of establishing a permanent office in India, my advice would
                        be to do it if there was a straw of a possibility of a practice there. You
                        could be back here for a month or two each year and I am satisfied to remain
                        here if it is necessary. This would remain your residence. Apparently your
                        period which Mr. Meebold says is important for us to learn, suggests that,
                        however little personal advantage there might be in it, and neither you nor
                        I are interested in that side, you are due for a change:- 21 landscape

                    <p>those delicious rough lemons off our lemon tree, so you see I couldn't leave
                        Sydney.</p>
                    <p>We still have a performance to give Wednesday night. The Anthro Festival went
                        very sweetly. The lawn border very gay. Miss Leeson makes it her Sunday task
                        to behead the calliopsis, and the poker plant is out, and gladioli. Mr.
                        Herbert lectured Saturday P.M. "From Group Soul to Individual Soul" (from
                            <note>Hermann Poppelbaum's?</note> Popplebaum's Man and Animal) an
                        entirely Anthro Audience with Miss Mitchell here. Evening, Miss Drummond, a
                        wonderful talk on a Christmas thought, followed by general carol singing.
                        Sunday Miss Birch showed great capacity for lecturing in a talk on Christ
                        and the Ego. We are looking on these Festivals as a sort of normal school
                        for training Anthro lecturers for Miss Drummond to use as she thinks fit.
                        She gave a lecture a week ago at Kings Hall, the biggest audience they have
                        had in some time. This Theosophical group is not under bondage to the Adyar
                            <note>Theosophical Society headquarters in India</note> group re the
                        Christ event so she was very pleased when two of their higher-ups came over
                        to see her the following day to discuss what was the difference between them
                        and us. She stated it as the emphasis on the nature of the Christ. They
                        asked that we give further lectures and she suggested me for the Four
                        Ethers, Warmth, Light, Sound, Magnetism and Mr. Herbert for Man and Animal
                        and they are putting us on their announced program for the year, each of us
                        for two. She had a wonderful letter from Mrs. Growcott stating in detail the
                        marked increase in interest and activity in the Melbourne group, as if they
                        had sort of come to life.</p>
                    <p>Sunday P.M. Miss Mitchell's lecture on the "Child and Temperament" well
                        attended, and a beautiful warm night for the Play, but my goodness we missed
                        your efficient work down there. Many shortages in the illumination but
                        mysterious and wonderful nevertheless. Bim alone on duty, which included the
                        whole of the hill above, because the three Kings and the three shepherds
                        kept all the other men tied up with the performance. Five groups of the
                        third Hierarchy on the upper hill-side each with</p>
                    <pb n="55"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 55 ====]</p>
                    <p>one Archai holding a circle aloft, two Archangels with triangles back of head
                        and two Angels with wings. In each group an Angel set off a Roman candle.
                        The topmost group on a rocky promontory was silhouetted against the sky, the
                        star of Bethlehem above their heads shining through the branches of a great
                        gum tree. Gradually during the play they moved down the hill taking
                        formations as they came down till they all grouped on top of wall and then
                        down the double flight of steps. The cherubs clustered around Mary. The
                        speech chorus who had first spoken from the East Valley crest and then from
                        top of wall, knelt in the low valley below the Madonna, Kings and shepherd
                        group, each with a candle lighted by the five boys, the acolytes, who had
                        previously set off the Roman candles for the Angel Gabriel.</p>
                    <p>The only real faux pas was the shepherds coming in the 2nd scene instead of
                        the third. I had to let them practically come to a conclusion so as not to
                        mess it and then had to creep down behind the bushes and make them come off,
                        and had to hustle on the speech chorus and Mary and the cherubs in the
                        Annunciation scene and then made the shepherds go on from another entrance
                        and do their whole scene again as their lines gave all the cues for the
                        Heavenly Hosts on the hill which included flute solo and violin. If it had
                        been anywhere but that enchanted valley it would have made an unholy mess
                        but as it was it was hardly noticed by the audience though one man's
                        criticism was <hi rend="ul">a certain lack of co-ordination</hi>!!! Hope the
                        Wednesday will not have the flaws <note>reading from N-YHS</note> of this
                        really dress rehearsal. The girls were all enchantingly lovely. Everyone
                        spoke of Mrs. Walker's loveliness when as an Angel on the heights she played
                        the flute. It was a brilliant scene for they were all in color except the 5
                        cherubs who were in white as was Mary in the annunciation scene - Mrs.
                        Prescott, Mary. Next time it will be Mrs. Nicholls who too has been lovely
                        in rehearsals. There was a fine audience, Miss Leeson, the august librarian
                        of Australia's History Library, taking the shilling entrance fees if that
                        term can be used where there is no entrance.</p>

                        several times. Mr. and Mrs. Somerville dropped in and they stayed on to the
                        play. Mr. Somerville drove his car home to bring his children along. The

                            niece</note> - Am enclosing letters from Marion. These news sheets were
                        so good that I have hung on to them to reread several times. I have met very
                        few Europeans here but the Indians have been most hospitable and pleasant to
                        know and the environment is a great relief to live in because without being
                        very "ideal" it has charms everywhere, something totally lacking in
                        Australia and in America except where nature is free from man. In the
                        buildings of all sorts I recognize most of the "motifs" I have used or even
                        thought of in my lifetime of practice of architecture. Whenever I am free I
                        take a fresh route through this city on the bicycle which can be hired for 2
                        pence per hour. The distances are "magnificent" except in the bazaar centers
                        or "chauks" which are crossed in crowded and often narrow and winding roads
                        fed by narrower lanes where the bulk of the people live of course. On the
                        other hand the bulk of the city is given over to residences that are
                        "palatial" in character surrounded with luxurious gardens. The University
                        occupies such a garden with some of the Arch Gates and sections of the old
                        wall still standing. It was a garden famous for its mangos and the old
                        stately trees are the main basis of the embellishment of the Campus and
                        quadrangles. Marion tells me she is sending copies of my letters on to you.

                    <p>I am comfortable here and find endless source of interest in the environment
                        of an ancient civilization. More so too than one could have had said 20
                        years ago when everything in the East was stationary. It is not so for the
                        future and the prospect of fruitful activity is perhaps not less than in the
                        new countries of America and Australia which used to be in such contrast
                        with conservative European ways but which, unfortunately, have been coming
                        to adopt them more and more. One of the difficulties here which makes for
                        monopoly of opportunity now is that the standard of rascality set in the
                        highest places has put all enterprise under suspicion and business goes by
                        favor to those whose social position is established so well that they are
                        willingly highly paid for safety from fraud. Interest is fabulously high for
                        enterprise because of the insurance factor against being swindled
                        altogether. The Indians have been so adept in applying the tricks they have
                        seen worked so successfully by Europeans that it is particularly difficult
                        for one of them to gain the confidence of his fellows as yet and so,
                        professionally, the work goes to one or the other of the more conspicuous
                        foreigners whose reputation for trustworthiness has not been forfeited and
                        these are few indeed. My builder client, Mr. Alagappan who was for a long
                        time the responsible officer of the British Construction Co. and whose
                        wide-spreading work is the result of his known integrity says however that
                        without the prestige of a foreign reputation he cannot carry conviction to
                        his clients who are always expecting to be bluffed in technical matters.</p>
                    <p>After all it is the European not the Indian characteristic to take serious
                        account of things, just material things, which to the</p>

                        themselves, and as a means to an end questionable at the best; at the worst
                        it does not matter how much they are questionable so long as the end is
                        served. Take-down is the accepted principle with the servitor classes with
                        whom the foreigner comes most in contact and it is not without much sound
                        justification contemplating the higher standards of living and remuneration
                        amongst these. Yet a tonga walla (sulky car driver) in my experience with
                        one or two exceptions returns my money tendered as the legal fare posted in
                        his cart and demands 50% more until after harsh words the police are sent
                        for. Yet that does not make him in any way the less anxious to carry you the
                        next time knowing full well how he will be paid. Rules are not just rules
                        but human beings and haggling as the means of all trading was only done away
                        with in Europe through the Quakers. Americans particularly used to be the
                        worst victims, and an acquaintance here once saw one pay a golden sovereign
                        for a peacock tail fan, marked value then as now three cents, at the Lucknow
                        station.</p>
                    <p>Here in Lucknow we are not in the tropics but in the In-temperate zone.
                        Lucknow was the hottest point in India last summer and it is often the
                        coldest. I sleep under two blankets and an eiderdown comfort at elevation
                        500. As I have already mentioned, social contact is the only road to
                        business engagements here. Already through the family of Raja Jahahjirabad
                            <note>Jahangirabad?</note> I have been requested to make an appointment
                        with the second largest landlord Raja (Raja Mahmudabad) in these United
                        Provinces, whose mania is the collection of a million books and who wants to
                        spend $25,000 <note>$250,000 at II.3.53</note> now on housing this library
                        in the making. You see libraries are my particular speciality just now. His
                        present English style plans obtained in Calcutta do not please him. A
                        $25,0000 invested in buildings here produces to all intents and purposes a
                        $100,000 building result according to Australian standards.</p>

                    <p>31 December, 1935, Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin
                        - I gave up the trip to Peshawar because Mr. Alagappan is ill with a fever
                        in Benares. Even here, where there is such a considerable English
                        sprinkling, the servants of these Europeans cannot speak their employer's
                        language and so Hindustani is the connecting link with them as well as
                        between the various peoples of India generally. Between our Christmas
                        holidays there occurred after Friday night the Mohammedan breaking of the
                        annual month's fast concurrently with the National Congress Diamond Jubilee
                        Day. The streets were filled with brilliant silks and satins and men and
                        women and children who foregathered in a section, Aishbagh, which is their
                        customary center for this particular festival. Evidently it is a picnic
                        feast but, like all the goings on here in public, without any sign of
                        organized amusement and without any hilarity or noise or confusion. I only
                        skirted the throng taking the occasion to cycle through Old Lucknow, the
                        Northwest section, where the picturesque narrow lanes were almost deserted.
                        Evidently strong drink offers no temptation to the Indians for I have seen
                        no sign of its sale or use or consequences anywhere as yet. Yesterday two
                        gaily attired fellows were causing much congestion in the street by their
                        conviviality with arms around each others necks and boisterousness but not
                        rowdiness. From their feature characteristics, pointed out to me in examples
                        previously by Mr. Craig, I recognized them as unmistakable Nepalese,
                        predominantly Mongolian, from the adjoining inaccessible independent nation.

                        unadulterated joy that pedaling is. The roads in the country as well</p>

                    <p>as in the city are not only crowded with pedestrian travelers but with herds
                        of animals large and small, pack animals, asses and cattle and occasional
                        camels, and strings of massive wagons and carts drawn by oxen or buffaloes
                        wobbling from side to side with the drivers, more frequently than not, fast
                        asleep. Cycling in and around the town on roads, which at this season, are
                        everywhere adapted for the purpose, circumvents all these obstacles and, at
                        the moderate speed imposed, employs a minimum effort. For me anyway, perhaps
                        because of boyhood training of the muscles, the wheel is a magic carpet
                        under which the earth just rolls away in the opposite direction. I have not
                        priced wheels, which I notice are even sold on installments here, because
                        their rental is so cheap, but a Japanese machine such as I often ride and
                        which is good for two years at least costs in Calcutta from 15 to 18
                        rupees!! This is perhaps the cause of the absence of tramways here.</p>
                    <p>I got real satisfaction out of the American light opera "Naughty Marietta" of
                        Victor Herbert's old fashioned music. Such a piece in a realistic setting
                        makes a more convincing combination of singing and acting than the opera
                        could afford on the stage. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer control the theatre here in
                        Lucknow and have recently opened their picture palace in Calcutta. I
                        understand they are planning to go into the production of Hindu drama for
                        native consumption. Think what a magnificent field in religious mystery and
                        mythology and music such conscientious production as theirs could open up!
                        There are three talkies in Lucknow given up to presenting species of local
                        production of successions of stilted and actionless dialogue.</p>
                    <p>We have had further boarders here for a day or so each of late all, as on the
                        previous occasion, Anglo-Indians. By official edict this term no longer
                        means English born in India but all who can trace their descent in whole or
                        in part to Europe. Thus as a result of political organization and
                        representations to government the separate characterization of Eurasian was
                        done away with. Miss Johannes, the principal of the</p>

                        I shall write to his nibs von Neurath as Miss Drummond wishes. Poor martyred
                        Germany, first under foreign yoke then under equally ferocious domestic
                        tyranny. My new draftsman, <note>name erased</note> who has had only
                        engineering drawing experience with a Railroad and has never used a Tee
                        square, is making a conscientious start with admirable pains and promises
                        better speed with the help of the parallel rule that Mr. Alagappan borrowed
                        for him today. Deputizing some of the tracing has enabled me to clear up
                        some of the lesser jobs that have been pending including some alterations
                        for University buildings they have asked for. Servants are not a
                        satisfactory substitute for mechanical aids even in India. Of course only
                        Musselmen <note>Mussulmen, i.e., Muslims</note> and pariahs will serve
                        Europeans. It is customary for servants to pad prices, thus my landlady
                        tells of a case where a nobleman made his cook a handsome monthly allowance
                        on condition that he forego this practice. After a month's trial this
                        servant handed back the allowance saying that he did better the old way! On
                        two occasions I entrusted letters to be posted by Mr. Alagappan's "munshi"
                        but as yet I do not know whether he did so or soaked off the stamps for
                        himself. I found afterwards that Mr. Alagappan would not go so far as to
                        trust him with stamped letters.</p>
                    <p>Amongst our occasional transients at the boarding house were a Parsi and his
                        wife. The Parsis are religious devotees, have fires they have kept burning
                        for 1300 years, and say their prayers, in a language no longer understood by
                        scarcely any one, five times a day including midnight. They have been
                        translated but as a rule they go through them as</p>

                    <p>a ritual without any significance. Mr. Craig pointed out to me in Bombay
                        several cases of obvious disability amongst these people who are all
                        comfortably fixed. The cases I saw were paralytic but I am told that
                        tuberculosis and leprosy are rife amongst them attributed to their long
                        continued exclusive intermarriage. This is the other side of the eugenistic
                        case in which the Persian Sect constitutes the outstanding example of
                        cultural advancement through selection.</p>
                    <p>I am still encountering the evidences of the educational prestige that is
                        needed for success in an Indian amongst his own people. One of the
                        professors on the Library committee obtained his decoration at Harvard. The
                        Health officer in the Town Hall who signed my vaccination certificate did
                        his post-graduate work at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. What a pity they could
                        not have studied "The Threefold Commonwealth" at these places also and so
                        have found their bearings for the new educational and political course on
                        which they have just embarked. I am loath to part with your letters in a
                        hurry for Georgine because of the wisdom to which I refer again and again.
                        Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>9 January 1936, - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley
                        Griffin. Tuesday and Thursday evenings I went with Miss Drummond, who is
                        working with the Australian broadcasters in the production of the operas,
                        arranging connecting links where they have to be cut to fit the time
                        requirements, to the broadcasting station where d'Abravanel, who it seems is
                        a young Portuguese Jew, was conducting the opera Rosenkavalier of Strauss
                        for the Radio. Miss Drummond heard the first production of the opera in
                        Germany with Strauss himself conducting and, as she said, all the conductors
                        in the world in the audience. Apart from the work itself which was I should
                        say a remarkable and sustained play upon the emotions, I was immensely
                        interested in how things are done in such a piece of broadcasting. The half
                        hour preceding made you feel you understood the effectiveness of Chinese
                        music. Most of the members of the orchestra were busy severally practicing

                        excitement.</p>

                    <p>It certainly outfutured the futurists. After the program began, the big ones
                        of the Australian singers were going for their lives into the microphones
                        against the noisiest orchestra you ever heard. It would have been
                        interesting to be able to hear it at the same time over the air but
                        doubtless it sounded quite usual there.</p>
                    <p>I think I have come to an understanding of this love business. We learn from
                        Steiner that the soul longs for the spirit, our own soul longs for union
                        with our own spirit. With no direct knowledge of this nor conscious contact
                        with the spirit we interpret that as the urge for our human mate, and the
                        search begins and disappointment comes for the unsatisfied longing
                        continues, but finally when we are driven to the spiritual for refuge, if we
                        have developed ourselves sufficiently, we find our spirit, our Ego, and the
                        soul becomes united with the spirit. When we have done that we have indeed
                        changed our temperament for that is the balancing of the four ethers and
                        then we are neither man nor woman but both.</p>
                    <p>What did you do to your hand? Aren't you a bad little thing. Coasting down
                        hills again without a proper brake? How wonderful if the American movies
                        take up India. They will surely send them round the world. I am disgusted
                        you didn't get that Northern trip but agree with you that it would have been
                        embarrassing without Mr. Alagappan. Hope he is all better now. Marion Mahony

                        - My landlady is laid up with arthritis which may or may not be a reflection
                        on the type of over-acidulate regimen that we share here though she has said
                        that if I stayed long enough she would have to become a vegetarian. However
                        she has been going some seventeen years longer than I have as it is. She is
                        somewhat of the type but on the whole much hardier seeming than my
                        grandmother who lived to be 90 as you will remember. I have indulged in two
                        cinema shows this week because the programs were so good - Anna Karenina
                        with Greta Garbo and Cecil B. DeMille's "Crusades."</p>

                    <p>An article in one of the papers has put the case that Hollywood is doing more
                        for the awakening of India than the British ever could. Certainly such an
                        artistic presentation of all phases of human civilization cannot but arouse
                        a growing interest in things outside themselves that these so subjectively
                        disposed peoples need if they are ever to change at all. As it is the
                        Brahmin head Vice Chancellor of the University is quoted in the paper
                        advising all Indians to relegate their religion to the background as the
                        only means of reconciling their differences and caste distinctions which he
                        abhors but can fight only with contempt as we advocate for politics. Walter

                    <p>23 January 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                        One of the popular illusions about India is that it is vegetarian,
                        apparently by failing to take into account the insignificant proportion of
                        higher castes. In the North here the meat consumption must be equivalent
                        with other places of similar economic state. Another illusion is that time
                        doesn't matter much because the incidence of the matters concerned happens
                        to be different from some other places. The Puja of the Brahmins, the
                        exacting schedule of the Pardes and the five daily devotions of the Muslims
                        must keep a live consciousness of time as good as that of the American
                        hustler. So far in my affairs I have found as little leniency in this as in
                        Sydney at any rate. Possibly the reduction in proportion of alien exploiters
                        is changing the condition. Though my draftsmen's hours are 10 to 4, there is
                        no stopping for lunch nor is there any reduction Saturday nor Sunday. In
                        fact, though Civil Station shops are closed and the church bells ring, there
                        is little difference between Sunday and the other days amongst the populace.
                        The hawkers start calling before daybreak and continue well into the dark.
                        Just the same also with building operations with women as well as men
                        carrying on construction with lanterns to eke out more wages at the 8 hour
                        day time rate. The real difference of course is in the repeat of the wheel
                        of time as against the spiral concept of evolution of the West.</p>

                    <p>My first building in India promises to be the additional Zenana Palace for
                        Jahangirabad on which I am rushing the drawings because the Raja finds on
                        consulting his almanac that Saturday of this week, the last of the lunar
                        month, will be the most suspicious <note>auspicious?</note> day for a long
                        while to start my work. My first view of the site was last Saturday
                        afternoon when the arrangement of the floor plan was discussed at length,
                        the dimensions being a question of inches almost because he is removing
                        parts of other buildings to make a courtyard frontage available. Naturally
                        some of these arrangements have had to be upset as the result of further
                        study here of stairways, etc. and the whole question of exterior is being
                        settled, I hope, without consultation with the owner, pending our breakfast
                        with the Raja Saturday morning.</p>
                    <p>Jahangirabad lies some thirty miles north of Lucknow and it was a fresh
                        sensation when we were taken out there by the car sent for us Saturday. As
                        with the Moguls themselves the chief sport of this landlord is pulling down,
                        rebuilding and extending his palace buildings and gardens. The proprietor
                        showed us through his main house in addition to the section we are
                        immediately concerned with. The rooms were vast as he inherited them but he
                        has been throwing them together to make them vaster still in his time. The
                        only architectural feature of special interest however was a Paridari or
                        garden pavilion which I was much taken with when we were escorted through
                        the gardens by his overseer and his gardener. This fact made a hit with the
                        chief when we got back to tea and found that it was all his work unassisted
                        and I told him that architects were superfluous in his case. Because he is
                        unable to draw he must have had some real assistance in modeling the
                        exquisite plaques, all different, on the interior walls but that he has a
                        developed aesthetic sense is evident from his garden as well as from some
                        chance observations on the state of architecture in America.</p>
                    <p>Gardening is a faculty that apparently came to India from Persia or at any
                        rate with the Mohammedans. This example is based on a system</p>

                    <p>Friday afternoon was the occasion of the lawn reception at the Ghulan Hasan
                        home in Lucknow the Begam Hasan's brother and his bride from Peshawar. The
                        catering was European style but there was no governor there nor any
                        considerable proportion of Europeans but it was an occasion to see the elite
                        of Lucknow, cloth of gold in rich embroidery was characteristic of many of
                        the men's costumes including turban, and of course of the groom's. The saris
                        of many of the women were the most attractive feature, in fine fabrics and
                        rich coloring, one with bands of black and red and gold being especially
                        striking. The bride was precisely the living Persian painting that we have
                        seen reproduced in books of Eastern art. She was petite with finely modeled
                        features, almost fair complexion, with a richly embroidered lace
                        architectural head-dress and salmon and Naples yellow tinted gown. I took
                        special note of this much for the purpose of this correspondence but my
                        ignorance of the technical terms prevents my transmitting further details.
                        The effect however was exquisite altogether and suited to the demure
                        attitude such as one would expect from a lifetime of purdah.</p>
                    <p>My most comprehensive contact at this function was with an Indian Yankee
                        whose speech is Americanese, who is a graduate of Northwestern</p>
                    <pb n="67"/>

                    <p>and Illinois universities, and who was a member of both their football teams
                        and was a Major in the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917 in France. He
                        is now teaching physical education in one of the colleges in Lucknow
                        supported by American missions where he is handicapped by his poor knowledge
                        of Hindustani. It seems that he went to America at the age of six with his
                        parents who were completing their education there. When they returned to
                        India he was fourteen and elected to stay in U.S.A. earning his own way. He
                        found no difficulty there due to race or color and succeeded and only came
                        back to India because the British queried his citizenship qualifications for
                        the American army and, for reasons I did not quite follow, induced him to
                        leave. He attributes any color disability that people such as the Indians
                        find, or before the war found, in America to their own inferiority complex
                        or diffidence. However it has taken him so long to accustom himself to India
                        that he would not advise others to gain their education abroad until they
                        had become thoroughly grounded at home.</p>
                    <p>An Anglo-Indian engineer of the Irrigation Department came in yesterday to
                        get advice on the completion of his extensive home opposite Government
                        House. He also left particulars of another house for sketches and broached a
                        large business block which he had already planned for the business center of
                        Lucknow. I shall go into these matters with him later. This week I was
                        pressed to prepare a grounds plan for the University Library which I did
                        including the plantings, some fifty species of the brightest things in the
                        way of trees especially that I have seen in India so far. The phenology may
                        be all off as I have not studied the cultural conditions or special soil
                        requirements but most of my observed specimens were old and thoroughly
                        established beyond cultural stages and mixed together in the Gardens at
                        Perydenia and Lucknow or in the wild. The language difficulty which is a
                        handicap with the draftsman is also evident with the typist to whom I am
                        dictating the specifications which are a test for most anybody. Walter

                        - Last Saturday I was transplanted back into the time of the real journeyman
                        architect. On Friday the Raja called here to see that everything was in
                        readiness, which was far from the fact, and to take me around to see an
                        attractive arch at the Medical College for consideration in connection with
                        the new entrance to this Zenana Court and to point out turrets on different
                        palaces as alternatives to the minarets I had contrived for him which looked
                        too much like a mosque. When I had completed in pencil the plans, elevations
                        and section by Saturday morning Mr. Alagappan immediately pointed out that
                        they did not look like any other palace and set about suggesting
                        alternatives to propose in meeting that objection. But when we reached
                        Jahangirabad the Raja said "How beautiful; this is something entirely new,"
                        and to Mr. Alagappan only "Can you build it?" So that was all the argument
                        there was on his part and he called in all his retinue one after the other
                        to admire - which they did, of course, enthusiastically though the outlines
                        on tracing cloth were indistinct and rather indefinite.</p>
                    <p>So I completed the foundation plan then and there encountering the first
                        distinctly Indian difficulty in the fact that the dimensions of the rooms
                        arrived at according to my module were not all in even feet. I had not
                        realized that this was important though previously all the witness line
                        figures had been taken off the University Library plans and the room sizes
                        indicated somewhat arbitrarily. Mr. Alagappan was upset when the veranda
                        proved to be 13 feet instead of 12 feet and the drawing room 29 instead 30
                        feet! It seems the odd numbers would bring bad luck. The Raja said he would
                        leave this matter to me when I pointed out that the stairs and outlook would
                        be adversely affected by changing but under the circumstance that the
                        building interpenetrated two others I was able to switch the wall with a
                        clear conscience and relieve the misgivings of both parties. Naturally
                        future occasions may not be so simple but I think a little subterfuge may be
                        justified.</p>

                    <p>However I was able to supply the mistri (overseer) that we had taken with us
                        with a figured foundation plan before lunch after which I was astonished to
                        find all the trenches for every room accurately set out with lime lines
                        checked by cross diagonal measurements to the nearest half inch awaiting our
                        approval. Then 50 men were set to incising all these lines and embedding
                        brickwork corner and bench marks and soon after all the trenches were under
                        way full blast with another 50 on-lookers when the cocoanut sweets were
                        distributed to all as is the custom in starting works. Meantime the Ruler
                        had set up his huge red umbrellas, with tables and chairs for us around him,
                        in various positions of vantage, to discuss the next problem, of the
                        motor-car entrance-way. After discussing, with Mr. Alagappan in Urdu, my
                        suggestions for the locating of the stairs and the successive arches and
                        screens, he exclaimed, "Mr. Griffin is a real architect; this arrangement
                        will create a perspective effect!" And so what I say goes with him and I am

                        already, during Sunday, the trenching had been completed and the concreting
                        started! While we were there he suddenly decided to have us do a European
                        kitchen for which a space was created by demolishing further ancient
                        buildings forthwith. Aristocracy has much to commend it not the least of
                        which is the will and the power to make decisions. How different from the

                        paralysis that characterizes the sordid modern world and which are invading
                        India even, as exemplified in the protracted discussions of the University
                        Library (a government institution). However though the dependence on reason
                        has already arrived here the reason at least is relatively unprejudiced
                        still, and in my little experience I have yet to encounter the determination
                        not to be convinced.</p>

                    <p>his Lucknow palace Monday, a copy of "Wild Life" in exchange for which he
                        gave me several similar publications of the Wild-Life Preservation Society
                        of India on which he indorsed his name as President. His predilection for
                        his library building at Mamudhabad is ancient Grecian with wide colonnaded
                        entrance front and an open court with peristyle complete. Hence he showed
                        particular appreciation of my Melbourne Palais de Dance photographs amongst
                        those I showed him and also of the setting for Iphigeneia in Tauris with
                        which he is very familiar though he is only in his early twenties. For that
                        age a leaning toward Greece should be a good sign I should say. Though we
                        set no appointment for a visit to his palace I have heard, through my
                        introducer since, that he was favorably impressed with our work though at
                        this time the University Library plans were not at hand to show him
                        unfortunately. Mr. Young says that a word from the Raja of Jahangirabad will
                        have much influence with him for though he is of insignificant income as
                        compared with Mamudhabad the former has an influential standing as a man of
                        shrewdness as well as of taste. Incidentally he is chairman of the Pioneer
                        newspaper, President of the British India Society, etc. etc. To me he is the
                        Yankee Sultan or the Oriental Yankee as I told him with reason. I also
                        advised him that if his chef wanted a job I could recommend him to the

                        Burley Griffin<lb/> Dear Mr. Griffin, I met your father. I like him very
                        much. He was so gay and gallant. He took me to task for placing a chair for
                        him and later handing him his cane. "Treating me as an old man," he
                        exclaimed with much indignation covering a merry twinkle. Mrs. Griffin told
                        him about my wanting the Craig boy. His comment wittily and flatteringly
                        suggested that there were other ways of solving the problem of an only child
                        than by bringing up another woman's. We spoke of you. He said that if you
                        had stayed on in the U.S.A. you would have been the first architect in New
                        York. Mrs. Griffin said with a sweeping gesture, "As</p>

                        hangs from his watch chain, a Masonic symbol of high degree. Yes, I like him

                    <p>3 February, 1936 - Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin - My
                        dear Walter Burley, Thank you for an air-mail letter written in the midst of
                        strenuous work. I had further particulars from Mrs. Griffin of work you are
                        undertaking in India. Of course I am delighted, but - there is no mention of
                        your home-coming. You've been away ages! I have a hunch that Ernest Wood may
                        know of wealthy Indians who would be eager to have you when they know of
                        your presence in India. Did you post him a card to Adyar? I had a letter
                        from Komalam too last week. One sentence I'll quote. "I should very much
                        like to go to Australia for three months and return. If Anna (Mr. Craig's
                        mother) can look after Baby I can go to London and finish my training so as
                        to be employed permanently somewhere. I am afraid of the future." She has
                        her degree of B.S. in Economics from Madras University but feels that a M.A.
                        from outside would make all the difference in getting an appointment. (She
                        later took that degree in the Sydney University.) I have replied with the
                        offer to mind him (Arjuna) for as long as she needs to finish her course.</p>
                    <p>If they refer to you do please give me a good name as a bringer-up of babies.
                        The idea is not at all fantastic. Don't you throw cold water on it. Tell
                        them my own baby is thoroughly healthy and is as happy as the day is long.
                        While I am at home and occupied with one I could so easily deal with two.
                        Edgar is a generous darling. He is quite willing that I should do as I feel
                        inclined in these matters. Arjuna is one year old today and Deirdre is two.
                        A year is a convenient interval between babies. They each have the benefit
                        of the companionship. It is almost impossible to make up for this in the
                        case of an only child. Last Sunday was Ross Duncan's three year old party
                        and all the</p>

                    <p>Castlecrag children turned up to it in fresh frocks and rompers and brushed
                        hair. A couple of hours later they had to be routed out from the disheveled
                        medley running wild on the lawn and taken forcibly home.</p>
                    <p>Deirdre always takes a while to warm up to a party. She arrives pensive and
                        coy and begins with shy advances to brown bread slices with hundreds and
                        thousands, but with accelerating speed she deals with popcorns and jellies
                        and after an orange drink or two is at the stage of mounting her chair in
                        order to get a better view of what is to be had from the table. When it is
                        time to go home she is tearing about with not an inhibition left and has to
                        be caught and carried off. After dark she was found in pyjamas and slippers
                        wandering about the Duncan lawn (next door) like a ghost haunting the scene
                        of the afternoon festivities.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday night the Godfrey - Guyatt party invited me to go to one of
                        Dorris Fitton's productions. I like the spirit of that independent group.
                        After supper I got involved in a profound discussion with Tom Godfrey with
                        the result that I tip-toed home at 2 A.M. He is never rude to me as I have
                        heard him be to others though Effie says I try him sorely when I mention
                        fairies. But in spite of fairies we are quite good friends. Pearl Bault and
                        Sheila are with me. She says "It is good to be at Castlecrag when you are in
                        trouble. There is healing in this patch of earth." Harold Morton said of
                        Charles' passing:- "We could not have borne it anywhere else than in
                        Castlecrag."</p>

                        rather nice? Ronald Craig's mother may build in Castlecrag. She does not
                        make lightning decisions as Ron did but has something of his pleasantness in
                        action once she has made up her mind. The swiftness of Ron's illness and
                        death is so like other critical events in his life (his marriage, his
                        departure for India and others) that I feel that this too sprang from his
                        will. Please tell me what you think of the mystery of death.</p>

                        You can be content that you have not been on this trip heretofore because
                        there would be no escape for you from going back to drafting. Nor have I
                        found any effective alternative for either of us for that seems to be the
                        thing that needs doing here now, and it is somewhat hard to account for
                        where there is such a superfluity of qualified labor in almost every field.
                        If the Ahmedabad project comes to anything it will be worthy of the
                        architectural traditions of boldness, taste and skill that constituted basis
                        of that town (then larger than London) "the most beautiful city in the

                        issues he raises. It is too much to expect of anyone that he change his
                        character and his character it will have to be that is expressed in his
                        muddled house.</p>
                    <p>The only cinema I have seen since the "Crusades" is "Les Miserables" of the
                        March-Laughton interpretation that I missed in Sydney, a much more forceful
                        and telling one than possible on the silent screen. What is astounding about
                        such plays with a purpose is that they can be so popular without apparently
                        affecting men's thoughts or behavior. Perhaps the appearances are a little
                        deceptive, but the adventure of giving is hardly given credence anywhere in
                        Christendom since the case of Huge's <note>Victor Hugo's?</note> bishop.</p>
                    <p>I am wishing myself many happy returns of my Valentine (His wife's birthday)
                        being too late to wish you the same. We are just rushing off to the mail for

                        any time for subsidiary letters but I am taking note of them for an early
                        opportunity. Just after suggesting that you could address me here Mr.

                        is on the last syllable of his name in this Hindi which sounds so much like
                        French. Our Mogul client No. 1 always addresses him as Mr. Alla Gappa and
                        says that with such a name he can go anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Anent Mr. Nicholls admonitions against economizing, the Raja expressed an
                        immovable prejudice against pressed cement ornament which is done so
                        excellently and cheaply - and generally - here in Lucknow. I exhausted all
                        my arguments for the sake of the elaborate ornament I was recommending until
                        yesterday when he explained that he wanted it carved in stone! I find that
                        the Indian workman, who "cannot read plans" and is "so stupid that he cannot
                        be told anything" and is therefore "incapable of innovation" as interpreted
                        by the European misunderstanding, is one who is capable of carrying out <hi
                            rend="ul">anything</hi>, as soon as he knows what is wanted, and is not
                        satisfied with mere abstractions nor formulas which are all the usual
                        architect can generally supply and which must therefore result in mechanism.</p>
                    <p>I have just learned one Indian word - "verandha" <note>i.e., veranda</note>
                        through Mr. Alagappan's correction of my draft of his letter to Ahmedabad of
                        the word that every draftsman since America has changed from veranda by
                        adding the "h." Of the six ways in Sanskrit of rendering broad "a" the
                        distinctly aspirated one with the accent is correct. This long lack of
                        distinction of refinements of language on the part of both peoples makes
                        mutual understanding difficult and curtails intercourse after three
                        centuries of living together; "nabob" for "nawab" is as close as they
                        generally get to the mark but the fact that the masters have had to learn
                        the language of their life-long servants, even if after a fashion, seems to
                        show that the Indians' difficulties are even greater than theirs.</p>
                    <p>I am getting nearer and nearer to the bottom of the European fetish which has
                        made all the good houses, of this part of India at any rate, as
                        uninhabitable as the Australian houses were when we first went there. The

                        found any privacy anywhere and my present conclusion is that they were on
                        the right track at least so far as the climate of September, October,
                        November, December, January, February have so far been, and I find that
                        March, April and a part of May are also likely to be uncomfortable from <hi
                            rend="ul">cold</hi> if they could be said to be anything but perfect
                        which they are out of doors. The Rajah when pressed by me finally said that
                        of the three seasons in India the cool season was about seven months and the
                        hot season and wet season halved the remainder between them including May
                        and June in the former and July and August in the latter. Mrs. Palmer is
                        habitually on the verandha <note>i.e., veranda</note> to get the sun during
                        the day. The salvation of my cottage is the open doors to the East in the
                        forenoon and the sunlight windows on the West side in the afternoon and I
                        would not trade it for any respectable bungalow I have visited. One of the
                        paradoxes of the European bungalow life is that after shivering around grate
                        fires in gloom two thirds of the year, the occupants habitually spend the
                        remaining four months in "the Hills" to escape the heat their homes were
                        fictitiously designed to preclude. The Englishman who superintends the
                        buildings and grounds of the University here and who has lived in India most
                        of his life says to me that he scarcely remembers what the hot season is
                        like since he has taken good care never to be here that season! The whole of
                        New Delhi is as I have said before duplicated at Simla and presumably on the
                        basis of such experience and judgment as of this Mr. Smith.</p>

                        - At present I am checking and winding up as far as possible the Library
                        details including the furniture lacking any item of which the Librarian says
                        he will not bring the matter to a finality. His is the characteristic
                        temperament of the new "Democracy" that believes in unanimity of opinion.
                        Hence he is forever trotting out objections that have been raised after
                        exhaustive canvass by all parties concerned. However he has sent to me the
                        Authority <hi rend="ul">from Aligarth University for I am to prepare the
                            designs for their Medical College and Hospital</hi>. One thing about
                        this predominance of the intellect in India is that though it can subvert
                        through intellectual pride it means <hi rend="ul">impersonality</hi> and
                        does not subvert decision through <hi rend="ul">sympathy</hi> and <hi
                            rend="ul">antipathy</hi>, the feelings, that have so often thwarted my
                        efforts. On such terms I am reconciled to having no personal relationships
                        for a while anyway.</p>
                    <p>My landlady who was born in India and has lived here 75 years is not Indian
                        in this sense yet and I have failed to outwit her in the game I have been
                        playing with her afternoon tea. My Bengal draftsman has chosen Calcutta
                        working hours - 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. without intermission, for five and a half
                        days which is much better than the 10 to 4 period seven days in the week of
                        the previous recruit who was from Government not private previous
                        employment. When the bearer brought out my pot of tea and cakes at 4 P.M. I
                        sent him back for an extra cup which he brought with frowns and grumbling
                        and for which Mrs. P. at dinner lectured me on sharing with an Indian and
                        one whose caste I didn't know. I cannot argue with her because she is so
                        deaf, so on the next occasion I turned the whole tray over to my lunchless
                        assistant because I am already dopey in the afternoon from over-hearty
                        lunches. Though I warned him not to let the Bearer see him the jig was up

                        supremacy of the Mohammedans whose center it is in the provinces the

                        Allahabad the erstwhile capital. Mr. Alagappan, a Hindu of Hindus, approves
                        the policy that has encouraged the development of this city out of all

                        I was attracted by a notice, in the Lucknow Publishing House, of Rom
                        Landau's "God Is My Adventure." It has a fine chapter on Dr. Rudolf Steiner
                        and Anthroposophy.</p>

                        Hotel, the best place in Lucknow, as Mr. Alagappan advises, I presume I
                        shall have the problem of devising the appropriate gold braid for my lackey.

                        that in dispensing with one of the servants the Palmers would lose caste to
                        that extent. - 4 March - Mr. Alagappan finds that I can carry points with

                        necessarily a gamble with numerous unknown factors but for some unknown
                        reason, perhaps a good one not yet discovered, there is a considerable field
                        here for my particular kind of work without any effective competition. Mr.
                        Young, the Pioneer editor, says this is a fact but is equally at a loss to
                        account for it in a world where the struggle for work and opportunity is
                        desperate and nowhere worse than in India. Naturally I am looking out for
                        the "catch" and moving in a more cautions way than otherwise. Walter Burley

                    <p>4 March, 1936. Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks. At last, a
                        week ago today, we put the final touches on the plans and specifications for
                        the Library, including 15 sheets of blue prints of which four or five
                        concerned furniture and grounds and layouts thereof. It was all enjoyable
                        except too long-drawn-out by reason of the excessive checks and balances of
                        the University. Of course there are still things to be done that will take
                        time, engineering works particularly that however need not go on before the
                        construction is started. I have designed two buildings since, redesigning
                        another and am on the elevations stage of two others whose plans are I
                        believe settled now, and am feeling almost caught up in my work so far as it
                        was not left with me to make the initial move which I shall do next with
                        three other buildings whilst getting on with working drawings through my new
                        experimental draftsman meantime. It sounds almost like organization of the
                        work, but that is too good a name for this one-horse show yet.</p>
                    <p>We have entered on a transition season strangely enough a combination of
                        Spring and Autumn. Though there have been no rains, annual plants are
                        springing up out of the ground magically and straightway blooming. On the
                        erstwhile barren areas of my back door-yard are beautiful thistle-like weeds
                        a foot and a half high bearing many yellow prickly poppies. The deadly
                        nightshade datura, which is a perennial probably, is bearing white
                        cornucopias 5 inches long but I am most</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 79 ====]</p>
                    <p>interested in a "ground carpet" of which one tiny-leaved dark mat is showing
                        brightness in the sun and most attractive of all a miniature pinkish white
                        convolvulus in crowns one inch high by a foot or two in diameter is
                        sparkling with flowers in the mornings. This plant I find in the dooryard of
                        the hottest part at the base of a south fronting brick wall, amongst loose
                        rocks under a tree and even in the trodden areas of the motor turn where the
                        only other living thing is an occasional tuft of couch grass. Nobody in the
                        household or amongst the guests has ever stopped to notice such a plant if
                        any plant at all and so I only surmise that it is an evergreen perennial
                        from my four months experience during which it has bloomed off and on. The
                        crown looks old and if I dig one up I expect to find it deep-rooted because
                        it seems utterly indifferent to drought. Hence on the surface it seems to
                        have the qualities I have been looking for to make a substitute for grass in
                        many places where the care, watering, trimming and holding in check of grass
                        are objectionable.</p>
                    <p>The beautiful little-trampled lawns on which the Moghuls based their
                        wonderful garden schemes required constant flo oding and moving to keep them
                        bright, and the more democratic and poverty stricken inheritors of these
                        glories have had to let them fade. The University is an example and I am
                        still battling for the preservation only of the arch-bridged stone-rimmed
                        canal-like tank there because Dr. Walli Mohammed and others "cannot see"
                        when it will be possible ever again to fill this with water. It is designed
                        for irrigation purposes, higher than the surrounding gardens and would cost
                        nothing for water on this account but requires only that the steam pump be
                        removed to the river a third of a mile away and connected with such a pipe
                        as I laid down to the Haven Estate and which still supplies the Kanevsky's
                        and your house amongst others. This tank, by the way, must have cost as much
                        as the new library itself and is a thing of beauty without any water to all
                        except those who can see the dead leaves strewn over the bottom

                    <p>We have tried geraniums and the cerulean blue convolvulus sauritanicus for
                        turfing lawns at our Heidelberg, Victoria, home but though extremely lovely
                        these plants presented the impediment of six inches in height and were
                        subject to damage by trampling. I tried several years ago to obtain Lippia
                        canescens from Peredynia Gardens, Ceylon, and managed to carry a few
                        specimens that gradually dwindled from San Francisco to Auckland years ago
                        and got no farther, for the same purpose in Australia that might possibly be
                        served by this threepenny size sparkling morning glory yet to be identified
                        here.</p>
                    <p>The Autumn side of nature here just now is the fact that a large portion of
                        the native trees on the streets and elsewhere shed their leaves most
                        unexpectedly if gradually and for no apparent seasonal reason. There is no
                        grand display of color, merely browning yellowing of the leaves and I am
                        told the new ones will be back in a fortnight. Since the trees do not shed
                        simultaneously the evergreen character of the landscape is not materially
                        changed but there is less shade when more is beginning to be wanted. Walter

                        In India you never say "This is a fine day" because that is taken for
                        granted, but one does not need to leave the weather out of consideration in
                        foreign correspondence. Here we are just off the middle of March when the
                        "punkah" fans are supposed to be put into operation and after the University
                        hours have gone into summer schedule. 6 to 10:30 a.m., and I find two
                        blankets none too much in the night and bicycling perfectly comfortable at
                        noontime. We are getting a price on air-conditioning for the Library which
                        comes to about the initial outlay needed for punkah fans, and discussing the
                        problem with one of the architectural staff of the Public Works Department
                        the really insufferable season boils down to about a fortnight in June just
                        before the monsoon when the hot dry spell means 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Of
                        course we are still comfortable in this shack whose main drawback is the
                        bare land all around it devoid of lawns or</p>

                        whisked all over everything by the sweepers with their four foot long bunch
                        of broomstraws. This stirring up and smoothing out of the dust on the roads,
                        the yards and the floors is the nominal function of the "untouchables" now
                        being called "harijans" (sons of God) by the politicians and their
                        organizers.</p>
                    <p>For the past week I have been occupied with my tracer in working out the
                        elevations and details for the houses in hand including the stone carving
                        for the zenana at Jahangirabad. Mr. Alagappan thinks we should be taking our

                    <p>Apparently this spring time is the maximum of the flowering seasons without
                        any of the obvious physical preliminaries of causes such as "April showers
                        bring spring flowers." In the parks and generally there are herbaceous beds
                        and borders, largely annuals, by the acre almost, the real prototypes of the
                        illustrations of the perfected types and selected color blends. Amongst the
                        native trees Erythrina Indica is not only the gay specimen but a mere
                        representative amongst large trees with brilliant red flowers, such as the
                        Silk Cotton Tree, characterizing the warmth ether. And although there is
                        only an occasional red or yellow amongst the fading and falling leaves some
                        of the new leaves as in the case of the Kusam form a lace-like covering more
                        brilliant than the scarlet maple and towering well above the average.</p>
                    <p>For these three days there is a visiting troupe of "Balinese" dancers at the

                        Indian talkies and which enjoyed a run of a year and a quarter in Calcutta
                        some time ago. The theme and its presentation were somewhat obvious and
                        lacking in action, for Westerners, but without affectation and the singing
                        of the leading parts was especially delightful. The interior settings were
                        rich but not aesthetically idealized as they would have been in Hollywood.
                        Such a piece would therefore be unsuited for foreign screenings such as have
                        been successful for German and French spoken films, but peculiarly adapted
                        to the realist Hindu.</p>

                    <p>In a set of plans for the bank at Jhansi, I had demarked the square banking
                        chamber with an intersecting arc dome and had even studied out the methods
                        of calculating the single rowlock brick vaulting that would serve for both
                        shells which, erected without centering and with relatively little
                        reinforcing, makes a specially appropriate covering in this climate for
                        important rooms. I shall be using this expedient in houses maybe. For some
                        time I could not find out why my arguments of economy, insulation,
                        appearance, etc. had no effect with Mr. Alagappan until he was obliged to
                        say that Hindus do not use domes which are the prerogative of the
                        Mohammedans! Of course, all the ancient Hindu domes are corbelled, and on
                        the other hand the Muslim predilection for domes came from Christian
                        Byzantium. But in some Hindu University work Mr. Alagappan had been forced
                        to employ huge steel beams because the practical expedient of the arch was
                        tabu.</p>

                        after decades of fighting for flat roofs can yield to its use in this case
                        with good grace. And yet there are Buddhists of the Stupa tradition and
                        Islamites to turn to for domes for variety, but Christians, Hindus,
                        Buddhists, Mohammedans and Zoroastrians must all be distinguished by their
                        buildings as well as by their costumes and their names, like</p>

                    <p>17 March, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                        Still going like a scalded cat I have felt that I was coming to a hiatus
                        this week with two clients off to distant parts before seeing their
                        sketches, and others with work to be done and who are seemingly impatient
                        who have failed to follow up with the requisite data for me to go on. The
                        alternative bank plans went to Agra but there has been no time to hear which
                        if either has found favor. The Raja however calls twice daily at least to
                        see that there is no letting up of the pace.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Palmer acquired nine choice eggs recently and now has five chicks from
                        them. I have not started counting what may hatch from the 20 odd embryonic
                        jobs in hand which would make me too busy to enjoy life were they to pop out
                        of their shells all at once. But this is far from likely where the
                        consideration of time is so casual as it is in India.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the Director of Industries of the United Provinces came in from
                        Cawnpore after I had gone out on quest for blue printing and said he would
                        call this morning about 9:30. I waited until 11:30 before delivering to the
                        University the prints promised for the early morning and so missed the
                        Director again. However he made a third call this afternoon to tell me that
                        I was wanted to make the scheme for the Industries' Exposition to be held on
                        a forty acre tract in Lucknow in December. Tomorrow I am to inspect the
                        site. This business emanated from the Editor of "The Pioneer." Though I had
                        heard</p>

                    <p>nothing of this project it seems that it is comparable only to an exposition
                        in Allahabad before the war which was backed by the Government and cost
                        seven lakhs.</p>
                    <p>It has been 98 degrees on the verandha <note>i.e., veranda</note> the last
                        two afternoons but a "wet bulb" would show that equivalent to no more than
                        90 degrees in Chicago I am sure. Hot enough in the sun but breezy inside and
                        cool and comfortable in the evenings and nights. In looking for the Deputy
                        Commissioner of the American Consul I visited the Lucknow Christian College
                        which is a huge institution with large buildings and grounds, the earlier
                        ones designed by <note>Henry V.</note> Lanchester. This is another of the
                        American Missionary enterprises that are so much in evidence in India. It is
                        a college institution in the Australian sense in that the students are of
                        all ages. The Principal was away on leave but the acting Principal to whom I
                        was introduced was looking for professional advice as to whether there was
                        not a possible satisfactory alternative to the system of design and
                        construction that makes all the houses in India uninhabitable practically
                        for an American.</p>
                    <p>He brought out most of the points I have complained of to you in my letters
                        and I may hear from him since their house is such a good investment for the
                        institution that they can expand in that direction. I have had the
                        opportunity of looking through another, possibly typical, Indian house on
                        the order of the one adjoining the Civil Station (Hazratganj) for which I am
                        to do a new Zenana. In the newer instances the two story house rambles over
                        an irregular site with two courtyards and a dozen bedrooms arranged with a
                        jumble of stairs, baths, latrines and "drawing rooms" to make contained
                        flats for the families of the various sons of the prosperous stationer from
                        whom I get my drawing materials.</p>
                    <p>He is demolishing an equivalent area for further extension of this communal
                        home in the Chaulk facing one road which is perhaps 9 feet wide and another
                        which dwindles to 3 feet 11 inches. The rooms are no more</p>
                    <note>"Chaulk" is perhaps "chauk" and is defined by WBG as a "bazaar center"

                    <p>than 8 feet wide possibly because of the economic limits of flat roofs
                        constructed without steel beams or reinforcements, but the courtyards, open
                        to the sky, were cool to the point of chilliness in striking contrast to the
                        streets outside, in the middle of the hottest day so far this season. The
                        theory of courtyards as collecting basins for the cool air of the night on
                        the principle of the refrigerator which is open only at the top seems to be
                        borne out here. If it were not so I can conceive of the Indians as baked in
                        the ovens that their clustered congested houses, with few if any outside
                        windows or cross drafts, would be. The cheerlessness of the cramped quarters
                        with no view and little light, where even the roofs are high parapeted for
                        privacy was not, in this case, compensated for by any charm such as might
                        obtain with all the picturesque possibilities of interiors of varying
                        levels, and the impression was of confusion and squalor.</p>
                    <p>In chatting with the Civil Servant who does my blue-printing I discovered
                        that the Public Works Department have been busy with the plans for the
                        Exposition which is an All-India and International affair. And what do you
                        think the materials they are providing for are? Light steel framing and
                        corrugated galvanized iron! And this in a region where they can be
                        guaranteed to have no rain during the whole season of the fair and so there
                        is here available the cheapest form of temporary construction that is used
                        everywhere in the village - Bamboo frame work with woven cane lathing and
                        mud and cow dung plastering both sides, all whitewashed in tints. Evidently
                        the engineers are working on the unfortunate precedent of the Chicago Fair
                        hoping that standardized materials will have a full salvage value. I shall
                        give this policy short shrift when the matter comes into my hands. If there
                        would be one thing better adapted than anything else to discourage patronage
                        it would be such housing.</p>

                        Walter Burley Griffin - I do hope you'll be sensible and not discourage the
                        idea of Colin's <note>Colin Day</note> coming over to India. It seems to me
                        much better that he should go instead of myself to meet the drive that you
                        are in. I am cross with Nicholls for saying anything about money for there
                        is plenty here as he himself said when he showed me the cable, saying he put
                        it in only to try to make you feel that you should occasionally collect some
                        of your fees. I only hope you recognize it as a bit of Nichollism and that I
                        was not a party to it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nicholls sees to it that Mr. Dowland pays his quota on his back rent
                        regularly. Mr. Herbert gave his second lecture at Kings Hall on Man and
                        Animal and was given great applause at the end. They have asked him to
                        continue as often as he will. Miss Drummond again next Sunday. Kings Hall
                        will be turning Anthro if they don't watch out. I have resumed after
                        vacation time, the children's painting lessons, Josephine (Keller, next door
                        to Johnston's) and Ross being the new comers and Kaaren too having won the

                        Furness. David Jones department store is back of this, the idea being to get
                        Australia better known in the U.S. and they paid the expenses of this
                        reporter to come over and write up articles in America. It was on Mr.
                        Furness' own request that he came out here. He had seen Canberra and wanted
                        to see you. Failing you he asked to see me. Deans brought them out by the
                        way of the bridges, Pyrmount Incinerator, Pymble and Killara houses. He
                        seemed intelligent and I gave him a Canberra plan and pamphlet. The time was
                        short but he got a few things right perhaps. Possibly this is a Threefold
                        Commonwealth movement to bring the Economic interests to an understanding
                        without going through the Political instruments.</p>

                        children being of course recognized. It was a lovely day, and wonderfully
                        planned. The children all pirates, bright bandannas wound round their heads
                        and gradually stripping to a string around their waists with a palm or fig
                        leaf dangling therefrom, a search for treasure, a bonfire feast at which
                        Beth did all sorts of wonderful things, rides on the pony the whole tribe of
                        pirates with their gay colors trailing around after the horse, a tree
                        planting - a really wonderful afternoon. When I came home I stretched out on
                        the couch to read the Atlantic <note>March, 1936</note> and started with
                        their featured article, the first, some 12 pages long, and spent the evening
                        shouting with laughter and wiping the consequent tears from my cheeks. It is

                    <p>26 March, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                        We had a long and satisfactory session with the Provincial Engineer and his
                        assistant yesterday over the working plans and specifications of the
                        Library. There is no reason why this could not have happened about a month
                        ago in accordance with our schedule except for the indecisions of the
                        Librarian. There were no objections on the part of the building authorities
                        to anything.</p>
                    <p>One continually meets with difficulty in getting details or instructions
                        carried out. Col. Haig of the I.W.B. says that he can never get any
                        instructions carried out by the craftsmen no matter how reasonable or
                        expedient they may be. As soon as his back is turned the worker proceeds as
                        he was doing before, in his accustomed way, because he considers himself a
                        qualified tradesman which the architect is not.</p>
                    <p>Unless the Mistri (foreman) can be convinced that the instructions are
                        reasonable, which is likely only after long experience with the particular

                        Mistry <note>foreman, overseer</note>, provided the latter has been
                        persuaded, they will take and carry out instructions because he is their
                        equal, being a qualified tradesman in their craft. This system has preserved
                        a standard of workmanship from the degradation that has superseded in
                        Western countries. At the same time it exacts qualifications of the
                        architect as masters in the respective crafts which they have not kept up
                        and the craftsmanship has become fixed and stationary in consequence. This

                        Industries exhibition of all India which was opened by Mahatma Gandhi here
                        in Lucknow in connection with the forthcoming Congress. He spoke in the open

                        Hindustani and as good as Greek to me. The bulk of India consists in the
                        300,000 villages whose products are exhibited, also the processes themselves
                        of deft handiwork in all materials which bring such a miserable pittance to
                        the producers, perhaps one meal a day. Certainly the prices were tempting
                        and highly competitive with the machine products in all lines.</p>
                    <p>I can sympathize with the tremendous self-sacrificing efforts of Mr. Gandhi
                        and the organization he leads for the purpose of popularizing these home
                        products and giving continuous employment in the village and moreover a
                        decent living for the Indians. But, as he said in his speech, the ordinary
                        bazaars would be much more crowded during the evening than this exhibition.
                        Amongst the thousands who were there I failed to notice a single person of
                        European extraction. The exhibits are simply housed in shelters mostly of
                        wicker mats and the whole has been done through voluntary labor by devotees
                        who have in some cases been months finding their way afoot.</p>
                    <p>Three hours I spent there with a young University student who found himself
                        at the inner gate with a ticket (8 annas) and a bicycle and with no place to
                        put the latter. This was my predicament also except that I had been unable
                        to get a padlock whereas he had been able to borrow one with which at his
                        suggestion our two "wheels" were locked together and left outside; and even
                        the lanterns were still on them when we came out at 8:30 P.M.</p>

                    <p>29 March, 1936 - Cawnpore - Walter Burley Griffin to Eric Nicholls - Thank
                        you for your report, also the handbook. I agree as to everything done or
                        proposed. Mr. Young has decided to take his six month's leave from the
                        Pioneer, in England, at Doctor's orders, on account of his wife's illness
                        and is flying off on the 18th May. He has offered me the use of his house
                        rent free if I elect to stay in Lucknow but of course this involves the
                        retention of cook and perhaps the other servants, also car and chauffeur if
                        I wish. This would work out at least as economically as The Carlton Hotel
                        and be eminently desirable. Of course if the Exposition eventuates it will
                        be the solution of my problem here. Mr. Young advises strongly against
                        plunging Marion into the Lucknow summer and I am waiting to see what it may
                        be like. This I am writing on the verandha <note>i.e., veranda</note> of the
                        Cawnpore West post office which is closed for some reason. It is the Chamber
                        of Commerce Building where Shrivastova, whom I came to see, and Mr. Young
                        who drove me over are both attending a meeting. Cawnpore reminds me of an
                        American inland town in many ways. The largest textile mills are much in
                        evidence and the interesting town is a park to all intents and purposes with
                        large home places and tree enveloped meandering roadway drives. The bricks
                        of the buildings are more in evidence than in the predominantly plastered
                        Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls</p>

                        - With all our feasting on fruit these days, I was wondering if you got much
                        of a variety there and what your fruits are. Your pictures of the flora and
                        the climate have been most interesting. The young man in my Wednesday group,
                        Mr. Latter, my Anthroposophic son he calls himself, has joined the Society

                        (Chiropractor) is sending one mother after another of his patients to
                        consult me about their children.</p>
                    <p>Thursday evening I went to Joan Hammond's farewell concert (a pupil of Lute
                        Drummond's who is being sent to Vienna to train as an opera singer, another
                        Melba. You see they live down here in the water hemisphere - the realm of
                        the Sound Ether) in the Town Hall. A full house and very appreciative, a
                        beautiful concert. I am sending the program by regular mail. Joan with her
                        black hair looked lovely in a pale blue dress with white shoes and gloves
                        one of the ladies had given her, and Lute Drummond looked perfectly
                        beautiful and like an angel, in a long drapey, silver (not grey, silver)
                        gown and golden hair a halo, and played superbly, the most perfect
                        accompanist I ever heard except perhaps the leader of the Boston symphony
                        orchestra, Nikish <note>Arthur Nikisch?</note>, who used to play
                        accompaniments for the soloists in the concerts. She and Joan were as one.
                        It is all like a wonderful fairy story.</p>
                    <p>Next Thursday I am going to a dinner party at Pakies <note>a Sydney cafe
                            owned by Augusta Macdougall</note>. Mrs. Prehn (captain) in inviting me
                        said it was wonderful to see how everyone loved me. It was a nice tell for
                        her to pass on wasn't it? The series of concerts of Joan's have brought in
                        £1250 with which she sets sail for Europe on Saturday. If you had been at
                        that concert you would have realized what a power Lute is in Sydney. (She
                        was the founder of Opera in Australia. Was the only one who had an opera
                        score.)</p>
                    <p>The man in "Everyman" thought we ought to have an evening rehearsal for the
                        placing and attending of the lights so after spending yesterday (Sunday)
                        afternoon making costumes, at six o'clock we went down to the valley. We all
                        felt it helped tremendously and eliminated worries for the coming
                        performances. It was a full-moon night so we all enjoyed being down there.
                        We have been most favored in the midst of very frequent rains in having good
                        Sundays for our rehearsals. The fairies appreciate our recognition of them
                        and our safeguarding of their haunts.</p>

                    <p>6 April, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                        The warm weather here is much like Sydney's 96 degrees with considerable
                        breeze and comfortable nights so far. At Cawnpore to which Mr. Young took me
                        to visit Sir Jwala Prasid Shivastova, Minister of Education. etc. etc. I had
                        a delightful outing. Here is a self-made man who controls large woolen mills
                        who was educated at Manchester University and has been building himself a
                        huge mansion, costly and ostentatious, without professional advice except
                        from the 60 visitors such as I who have been invited to criticise. As the
                        building was long beyond the stage where it might be cured, I confined my
                        criticism to commendation of the unusual amount of light and air provided.
                        However he was starting work on his 17 acre garden and I revised his
                        drive-way arrangement presuming that no later critic has interfered. Even
                        with such a type, the Knighthood is carried as a pocket weapon and no one
                        addresses him as "Sir," and in seeking his address I found he is known as
                        "J.P." to distinguish him from his two brothers.</p>
                    <p>While I was there he rang up the bungalow of the Director of Industries on
                        whom I called in style with the Young's car and chauffeur. My competitors
                        for the Exposition I was told are the firm of Ford and MacDonald,
                        "Architects, Engineers and Contractors" whose factotum Mr. Souter</p>
                    <pb n="93"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 93 ====]</p>
                    <p>is also the Chairman of the "Cawnpore Improvement Trust." However I quoted a
                        price for a general plan which seemed to interest the Director and, as he
                        requested, sent the next day an estimate of the cost of a unit of quadrangle
                        frontage according to my own notion of plastic construction, not galvanized
                        iron which they have in mind. This housing to the extent of a room 10'X12'
                        comes to about Rs.40 net for the structure and an additional Rs.35 for
                        embellishments, arcade lanterns, pinnacles, signs, banners, etc. and the
                        whole takes the form of Pyramids, domes, arcades, etc. After my visit the
                        Lucknow assistant called and showed me over the site and said he would be
                        seeing me again with the survey feature plan of the whole of Victoria Park
                        which has been allocated to them. If this comes off I shall accept Mr.
                        Young's proposal. My servitors would consist of cook (Kahnsami) Rs.35,
                        Sweeper Rs.16, Dhobi (laundry) Rs.10, Chouk (watchman), 1/2 Bearers' wage
                        Rs.15, Electricity Rs.25, Household books, Rs.60.</p>
                    <p>The above would provide for entertainment to some extent and as much comfort
                        as there is anywhere here, at an advance of 50% on the primitive living in
                        the Anglo-Indian section.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chowdry <note>Chowdray?, Chowdhury?</note>, the Hindustani who
                        occasionally stops here, reports meeting American missionaries in almost
                        every town he visits. It is astounding to see the extent to which education
                        in India, in the European sense, has depended on the Americans. The
                        institutions named for the British such as "Canning College," "Hewitt

                    <p>The American contributors to the Europeanizing of India would be interested

                        abduction of young women of all grades by this service is enough to
                        stimulate such disparaging comment on imperialism as above indulged in.</p>
                    <p>I have been interrupted by a visit of two officials of the Exposition who are
                        anxious to get their ideas formulated, and a scheme to publish and circulate
                        amongst the prospective visitors especially exhibitors. It seems that the
                        Director of Industries (and of the Exposition) is still off on a trip with
                        "J.P.", the Minister. At each visit I have thrown out some further hints of
                        what I have in mind and evidently these officers are attracted by them.
                        Anyway they are sending a preliminary survey plan tomorrow for me to operate
                        upon in anticipation of a meeting of the Authorities on the 22nd. Mr. Young
                        will be getting in touch with Shrivastova on his return hoping to get my

                        being made in my bathroom! and his demand for complete calculations for all
                        the construction has been putting me through a course of sprouts in Rigid

                    <p>let her take the strain, so Saturday I gave a lecture instead on the Four
                        Ethers in connection with the human organism which I have never touched on
                        in my previous talks; and tied it up with Dr. Pfeiffer's recent publication
                        on the diagnosis of all diseases and their allocation to special organs by
                        means of investigating the crystals of the blood. The Hectors were here for
                        all sessions. Mr. Hector is talking about giving his color organ to the
                        valley theatre.</p>
                    <p>My piano has been at the Deans' for some six months. Little Kaaren tried for
                        some time to work out the problem of why it was there and finally came to me
                        with such a knowing tilt of her little head and such a look of understanding
                        and said - "I know, you used to let Clarmyra (my niece in Chicago) use the
                        piano and now you are letting me use it." Irven has her baby dancing class
                        there these days with Cappy (Kaaren's mother) at the piano.</p>
                    <p>Miss Drummond's Lecture was on Lohengrin illustrated on the piano and was
                        given there, and that wee mite Kaaren sat the whole program through in her
                        nighty gown and scarcely took her eyes off Lute in her simple flowing pale
                        blue gown and her constant graceful gestures. Any suggestion that Kaaren
                        should go to bed was met with a shrug of her shoulders and not even a
                        turning of her eyes. I saw Lute's aura for the first time, a lovely golden
                        radiance encircling her head. The creative art forces have risen and taken
                        the place of the normal intellectual forces there. Lute said if she had
                        known the baby was going to be there she would have made her talk for her
                        but there was no need for doing that. It was a marvelous evening. What a
                        story when you know it Anthroposophically.</p>

                        continuation of "Man and Animal" which he gives in a very masterful way now,
                        that amazing turning upside down of <note>Ernst</note> Haeckel's tree of

                        Macdougall</note> Sunday night and tonight, and old Mr. Harrison of course.
                        Miss Drummond and Bette Ainsworth broke into the Nicholls' house and stayed
                        there, Mr. Nicholls being up in the mountains on a week's holiday, Mrs. N.
                        and Glyn in Melbourne for a month.</p>
                    <p>Sunday afternoon another emergency to be met. Mr. Lightband was in bed with a
                        cold. Fortunately I had set aside a chapter I had recently translated to
                        meet possible needs, one labeled - An Easter Meditation - a chapter on
                        chance showing that there is no such thing but that all this realm falls
                        under spiritual law. It shows that what appears to be chance gives us a
                        tie-over to the spiritual realms in this mechanical age of natural law, and
                        enables us to <hi rend="ul">resurrect</hi> the spirit in ourselves. It makes
                        us realize that we have experience in other realms than those under natural
                        law.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hector (a Chemical engineer with a most wonderful collection of crystals)
                        was very anxious to have a fling at a talk to us and had brought over some
                        of his diagrams so we gave him the floor after the 4 o'clock afternoon tea
                        till a 7 o'clock supper, for by 5 the storm had settled in so we were able
                        to tell everyone who rang that the play was off. It was just as well for one
                        of our Five Wits was ill, and Miss Ruth Pierce Jones had rung to say she was
                        down with dysentery, and unknown to me Miss Leeson was busy learning the
                        lines of Knowledge; and Helen Morton arrived with such a croak in her voice
                        that she, who was Strength, could hardly speak. Miss Jones came along,
                        plucky little piece, but we put her to bed as soon as she arrived. A fine
                        sense of responsibility in these young people. By seven the girls had spread

                        wonderful, unforgettable pictures, like a Fra Angelico, is to see him at
                        Lute's weekly readings sitting beside her with his old white head, his ear
                        close to her mouth, as she, a golden haired angel, reads a Steiner lecture

                        soon as the lithographic survey is supplied, I'll be on the general plan for
                        the Exposition. Mr. Desmond Young of course put in the good word to the
                        effect that the officers would be committing suicide in going ahead with the
                        tin housing. All are agreed now that the public will be attracted only by a

                        Europe on Thursday. Meantime nothing much if anything will be done to

                        assistance is an honorary undertaking. Probably it arises from the
                        aristocratic antecedents whereby the nobles could command any service and
                        pay or not pay as the whim happened. The local Representatives of the
                        Director of Industries, deploring the efforts of one of the committee men to
                        take onto himself the duties belonging to the architect, says that the
                        custom arises from the fact that 95% of the persons interested in such
                        matters as buildings for instance are Civil Servants whose time consequently
                        is of no value, on the basis that their income is patronage. Do you follow?</p>
                    <p>The results are amateurish anyway and in this particular case, where Hamid
                        Hussain insisted that he look after the surveyors instead</p>

                    <p>of their coming to me for instructions, the result has been unnecessary delay
                        in getting the whole scheme started and the publicity going, and the end is
                        not yet. Lucknow is the center of popular interest for a few days because of
                        the 51st Indian National Congress where the organized political thought of
                        India gives itself free expression for which there is no scope in the
                        Government institutions. Mahatma Gandhi has been, until recently his health
                        has precluded, the leader of the movement but he is deemed too conservative
                        by the present President Nehru who espouses Communism as the only road to
                        independence. His socialist views are not yet shared by the majority which
                        still looks to Gandhi, but he hopes for conversion among the younger element
                        of the Congress, and quite possibly not in vain, in the future. What one
                        could look for in Socialism in a country evidently 90% socialist already as
                        indicated above - that industries are run by the Government - is only the
                        threadbare hope that the majority could control things better than the
                        experienced minority who may be mostly inferior to the majority but then
                        again may prove to be only of the same low level.</p>
                    <p>Political wonders have been accomplished along Mr. Gandhi's lines, so much so
                        that his thunder has already been stolen, but the step that will create
                        wealth sufficient for better living conditions rather than the shift of the
                        small quotum existing from one set of privileged beneficiaries to another
                        set of privileged beneficiaries has yet to be taken, that is the building up
                        of a complete National Economic Organization completely separated from the
                        Political Organization. The huge and increasing taxation that is going to
                        these special beneficiaries certainly operated to frustrate individual and
                        industrial enterprise. Except Tata, the Parsi, who owns the largest single
                        steel works in the British Empire, and some of the textile mills largely
                        Indian owned, these are few established concerns with plants. The Tata
                        concern is outstanding, valued at £30,000,000 and <hi rend="ul">staffed by
                            American engineers</hi> and with a considerable proportion of the fifty

                        American than to European encouragement. The taxes however go to England,

                        of all is political agitation. Interest rates through the disorganized state
                        of business and irresponsible political activity threatening interference
                        will have to be overcome somehow. Otherwise no country has greater sources

                    <p>17 April, 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin
                        - So glad to get your letters today. They make everything so perfectly
                        clear. We do hope Mr. Alagappan soon recovers. He shouldn't pile things up
                        too high all at once. We think Colin Day's coming over will relieve both of
                        you and hope it can be arranged before both of you work yourselves to death.
                        Yes you buy the book "God Is My Adventure" there and send it on to Clarmyra.
                        You'll probably not want to read it all but one gets such a thrill out of
                        such a splendid ad for Steiner. The two pictures of him and of Krishnamurti
                        are a striking comparison, the one - Krishnamurti - a perfect example of a
                        most wonderful civilization giving us a bond with the past (and no wonder he
                        can't read our modern dead philosophies),</p>

                        civilization for the lack of which Europe may before long find itself
                        perishing.</p>
                    <p>Wouldn't it be a thrill to have a gold watch given you by the lady of the
                        palace you had built. Do accept it if she really offers it to you. Have had
                        a nice note from New Zealand from father. I had a good laugh over it. Am
                        sending it to you by regular mail. We had a quarrel while he was over here
                        because he was calling people niggers, dagoes, etc. He really behaved
                        wonderfully over it but when he got to a safe distance away he had a good
                        fling back at me as you will see in his letter. He's like little Mary who
                        after a week of bread and water, said her prayer right when she thought she
                        was going to be left out of the camping outing, and as soon as she got there
                        said it wrong again. Mr. Pratten gave such an interesting report to his wife
                        of Father's visit to their house that Mrs. Pratten told Mr. Nicholls she was
                        very disappointed not to have been at home to meet him.</p>
                    <p>The other day I ran across in Steiner that creative accomplishment is not in
                        vain because it has not manifested in material form but that it persists in
                        the etheric realms where it is accessible to creative thinkers and continues
                        to serve human progress. This can be a real comfort to architects whose work
                        differs from that of other artists in being dependent on others for its
                        material fruition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Searby can cure insomnia by chiropractic. Steffen <note>Albert
                        Steffen?</note> says "the Ego can become an organ of perception only if it
                        becomes disinterested like an eye. In its gradual ascent to knowledge it
                        becomes independent of the body..... The artist does not eliminate as does
                        the scientist but uses the perceptible as a garment for the essential. The
                        scientist produces a vacuum in his consciousness in order to grasp the
                        creative essence. The artist strives after fullness of experience in order
                        to give shape to a perfect work of art." Poincare, the scientist, says no
                        creative idea ever came from reason.</p>
                    <p>For sleeplessness Mr. Alagappan should eat much lettuce and celery</p>

                    <p>and should eat his heavy meal late, go to bed as soon as possible after and
                        do no heavy thinking in between. The other meals can be as light as he
                        wishes so long as he drinks plenty in between. This was the doctor's advice
                        to the Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, when he was making up his mind about
                        conscription. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin</p>

                    <p>21 April 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin -
                        Our whole news this week is the production of the play - Everyman. A clear
                        still night Sunday and a good audience sitting on their stone and backless
                        seats in breathless stillness, gripped in the magic of that matchless
                        valley, your gift. All the reports back were that they were deeply
                        impressed. You wouldn't expect an old Church mystery play to be exactly
                        popular but that's the position it seems to hold. Some liked it better than
                        Iphigeneia. Stoker was very fine and so was Johnston as Death for which role
                        his rich bass voice was very appropriate. His mantel was the two Persian
                        couch covers, black embroidered with gold, sewed end to end carried by four
                        of the children. - Possessions (greed) in magnificent costume, the blue and
                        gold drape, high cylindrical hat of the Indian gold pattern squares, broad
                        gold belt and much bejeweled - rose out of a golden chest centered between
                        the double flight of stairs, at the foot of the stone wall. He has improved
                        enormously in his rendition and his long sardonic laugh, as he mounted the
                        stairs and made his exit to the West, was perfect, the Japanese couldn't do
                        it any better. Many comments on the richness and variety of the costuming.

                        dresses of mine, gay in color of course cut and slashed, and the house
                        curtains, and the headdresses, etc. were sumptuous and in true Medieval
                        style. Then the abstract personalities, Beauty, Strength and Discretion, a
                        group in Greek costume like the three graces; and the Five Senses (the five
                        wits) sort of wide betrousered group with crossing strips of various colors
                        and rakish caps; Mr. Williams, all in scarlet, a Cardinal's costume, etc.,
                        etc., made most interesting and lovely groups on the East slopes where the
                        Angel of the Threshold came at the end and led Everyman up to Heaven - and
                        the Angel groups on the upper hillside from the top of the wall to the top
                        of the hill where an angel (Mrs. Walker) played the flute for both the
                        beginning and the close of the play and from where God (Mr. Herbert
                        concealed behind the rocks) spoke with his powerful voice; and the different
                        colored flares on the various groups, made a magnificent spectacle which
                        never for a moment lost its simplicity and its lofty appeal.</p>

                    <p>"The City Gate" is the Gol Darwazza on the south picturesquely terminating
                        the Chauk Road and from which solidly built Lucknow stretches for four
                        miles.</p>
                    <p>The "Suburban Gate" is the Rumi Darwaza on the east terminating the system of
                        roads of the River Valley which comprises the parklike suburban districts of
                        Lucknow, stretching to and through the Cantonment, a distance of seven
                        miles.</p>
                    <p>The "Village Gate" at the west end of the Exchange Court is the terminus of
                        the High Way (Napier Street) with bus service for the villages extending to
                        the Hardoi, 50 miles.</p>
                    <p>The "Country Gate" at the west end of the "Court of Seven Gates" serves
                        Hussainabad and the district south of the upper reaches of the River.</p>
                    <p>The "Water Gate" at the North opens from the Bridge of Boats and the
                        Agricultural Demonstration area of the Exposition as well as the North Bank

                    <p>The "Royal Gate" on the East at the Vice Regal Gardens opens from the King

                    <p>The "Service Gate" on the South East corner terminates the Victoria Road
                        artery and is the inlet from Canning Street direct from the Railway Junction
                        to the Goods Storehouses within the Exposition. It also relieves the City
                        Gate by offering a by-pass during congested periods and to divert bicycle

                        wrestling, boxing, folk-dancing and festivals and sports as well as serious

                        Hope to get some word from you there as to where to go next. Mrs. Maddocks
                        is moving into our house right away and Mr. Nicholls has made some dicker
                        with to carry things on. It gives me a very comfortable feeling to know that
                        she is going to be there. The hot summer means nothing to me. I am like
                        Mother who loved the days that went to 105º and was disappointed that all
                        Australia days were not like that. All sorts of things to be done these last

                    <p>Cable from Lucknow - Thankful.</p>
                    <p>30 April 1936 - S.S. Comorin, between Sydney and Melbourne. Marion Mahony
                        Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin. Wednesday - An hour after I mailed my air
                        letter your cable came and I got much satisfaction out of its comprehensive
                        word "Thankful." It was a wild scramble to get off but that seems to be my
                        destiny or the one I bring down on myself. Before I forget I'll give you
                        Nicholls' message which was that this week Mr. Eric Pratten's stairway has
                        been settled. As he expressed it - he wore him down, so evidently he has
                        been having the same kind of dance you had with the fireplaces. Yesterday
                        was a mill pond, today white-caps but I am taking it all right. We had a
                        bigger audience at the 2nd Everyman performance than at the first and
                        everyone most enthusiastic. They let me off from back stage, or rather over
                        the hill, duties to see the whole play. It was entrancing. Quite a number
                        gathered afterward for a cup of tea. Pakie <note>Augusta Macdougall</note>
                        who had brought half a dozen the first evening brought a dozen the 2nd time.
                        The evening ended with complimentary speeches to me. Lute and Mr. Herbert
                        were lovely, Lute saying I was a true human, no class, no distinctions.</p>
                    <p>I rang Dr. Rivett re vaccination but didn't have a chance to get it in, the
                        passport and visa business take such a time. I had cabled I was coming in
                        all innocence having completely forgotten the fact and the jokes cracked
                        about the fact that I should be a prisoner in Australia because you in your
                        usual rush had gone off on my passport, the one about which the British
                        Consul in Chicago had said "The American Government does do the most
                        extraordinary things!" because you were going as my husband instead of my
                        going as your wife. For they can't issue two passports to one person.
                        However the young woman there in the Consul's office was very ingenious and
                        wangled it for me saying the one you went on had expired in March though
                        strictly speaking, etc.</p>

                    <p>Also you had registered yourself as an American citizen and that included me
                        though strictly speaking etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>Twenty ladies of one of the Clubs had planned to come out at 11 o'clock
                        Tuesday to see Castlecrag. They came but Mrs. Maddocks took them off my
                        hands so we still have to thank the angels for Mrs. Maddocks. I did not get
                        home till 4:30 and within a quarter of an hour Mrs. Evers dropped in. She
                        was feeling bitter about something and I had to get the bitterness out of
                        her (No good in one over 80 years of age) so we talked till seven and still
                        no packing done. Monday Mrs. Maddocks and I had spent a few hours in town
                        shopping, my need being summer things most of which she supplied me with out
                        of her own wardrobe. You wouldn't believe it but all of her things fit me
                        perfectly, dresses, hats, coat. After Mrs. Evers left I sorted out things
                        for a while and then Mr. Junge was sent up for me from down below to bring
                        me down in his car to a goodbye party of Castlecraggers. A good turn-up. Mr.
                        Duncan master of ceremonies, a jolly time. Pakie <note>Augusta
                        Macdougall</note> and Irven <note>Herbert</note> and Joan stayed all night
                        with me. I didn't wake up till 6:30 in the morning and packed steadily till
                        Mr. Deans came for me in his car at about 10. So trunk and valise were
                        strapped on and heaven only knows what I am bringing and what I am leaving
                        behind.</p>
                    <p>A jolly bunch at the boat to see me off, four of my babies with their
                        parents, Deirdre, Kaaren, Ross and Bronwen with baskets and bunches of
                        Castlecrag flowers. Thoughtful gifts meeting all my needs, letters of
                        introduction, one from Miss Leeson saying we were two of the greatest people
                        in the world, a wonderful box of every sort of fruit, persimmons, custard
                        apples, pawpaws, grapes and all sorts of surprises tucked in that I haven't
                        come to the end of yet including a Teddy Bear (Koala) for a permanent mascot
                        from the Searbys. A Daily Telegraph reporter was there. Heaven only knows
                        how he got the word I was going. It is now in new hands, the same as the
                        weekly which has been publishing your houses, and which put in the article

                    <p>May 1936 - 56 The Parapet, Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin
                        - There have been swift changes since I last wrote you. Castlecrag gathered
                        to farewell Mrs. Griffin on Tuesday evening and waved her farewell on
                        Wednesday. Mr. Nicholls made the suggestion that we should live in your
                        house and that he would take over ours for the time being. I was very well
                        pleased with the proposal he made. First it will be a real help financially
                        but principally because I know of nothing I'd rather expend my energies on
                        than Castlecrag and no one for whom I'd rather work than you. We're going to
                        enjoy this house. I've always liked it and the magic still lingers though I
                        admit I was appalled and amused at the contents of the garage as seen in the
                        glare of the headlights. I can see that my mental dimensions for the
                        duration of your absence will be understanding this filing system of yours.
                        I look at CDCCCBB and am reminded of Tennyson's poem:- "Flower in the
                        crannied wall, If I knew what you are Stem and all and all in all, I would
                        know what God and man are." 21 May - Mr. Nicholls has been exceptionally
                        nice and helpful to me. He solves all the problems that arise with a free
                        and easy confidence and without fuss, and at the same time with a sense of
                        responsibility</p>

                    <p>which makes working with him easy and pleasant. Mr. Deans too, though
                        somewhat aloof and formal (Probably because he is shy) is being quietly
                        helpful. He prepared a set of sales plans, price lists and general
                        information all neatly assembled in a folder for me and spent an afternoon
                        driving me around to locate the blocks. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley
                        Griffin</p>
                    <p>25 May - 1936 - Sunnyside Crescent, Castlecrag, Mrs. Trinick to Marion Mahony
                        Griffin, Annette was delighted with her letter from the boat. When she
                        brought it to me and I said "Oh this one is for you" she couldn't open it
                        for excitement.....My second attempt - Well Annette's letter is safely put
                        away in her own writing desk, after I read it to her. Wally was also called
                        upon to read it to her. She astounds with her sayings and what happened
                        yesterday was so unusual that I can't help passing it on to you as I know
                        you'll appreciate it fully. She had been ..... Well a third attempt - My
                        babies arrived Michael and Mary so you see I had twins after all.</p>

                        - Marion is due in Calcutta where Mr. Alagappan will meet her and see her
                        safely off in the Lucknow carriage of the Punjab Mail of the East Indian
                        Rail Road which is broad gauge and well equipped. The train leaves Hourah
                        (Calcutta) in the evening and reaches here about noon tomorrow. I could not
                        make the journey myself because of my clamorous clients and moreover I would
                        be as much lost in that direction as she. Marion can let down a peg her
                        activities here, in fact the heat will enforce that if she is not otherwise
                        relieved by the fact. I think she might find it a relief, but a whole month
                        on the Pacific and Orient is a big dose to start with. Another six months
                        alone on my part though would be too much. The two of us together will make
                        it quite different.</p>
                    <p>A thing that they think here that they must do each year or so with their

                        the entire lawns. So the front section of this place as a result of two
                        weeks work now looks like a plowed field, and the two side lawns will</p>

                        the to me seemingly great waste of effort this process destroys the
                        attractiveness of all the beautiful home settings for a third of the time.
                        The same with the flower borders which are almost entirely annuals. During
                        this time the elite are supposed to be up in the Hills. I have undertaken to
                        plant and seed next year's extensive borders here for Mrs. Young but surely
                        if I were to stay here any length of time I would find the way to "balance"
                        the growths in perpetuity by using perennials, and would substitute
                        mechanical irrigation to provide continuity in place of the ingenious tin

                        biblical times.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that may perhaps justify the Lucknow Exposition is the four
                        acre demonstration of the Provincial Hydro-Electric Department under Sir
                        William Stamp of the application of low cost electricity to the solution of
                        all the problems of village industry and domestic amenity. One of the model
                        houses I have to make is for this demonstration and I know of no better way
                        out of the difficulty of the perennially starving and suffering millions in
                        the villages that make up India. The Exposition in adopting my plan also
                        accepted my classification of the whole five distinct sections:</p>

                    <p>So far this has worked well to the satisfaction of prospective exhibitors
                        though there has been one lapse in introducing dog races into the stadium

                        Calcutta but came directly on to Lucknow which is lovely. For a month Walt
                        has been living in the home of the Editor of "The Pioneer" paper. A week
                        before I arrived he and his wife flew to England. So we are </p>

                    <p>living in this quite palatial home with spacious grounds, and are cared for
                        by 12 servants - 2 butlers (bearers) who also take full charge of the
                        household arrangements, a cook who is worth coming to India to experience, a
                        real artist and a picture himself, 2 sweepers, a night watchman who is of
                        the renouned <note>renowned?</note> caste of thieves who have now taken over
                        this polar opposite profession, 5 gardeners and I have forgotten who the
                        other one is - Oh yes the laundryman. Next month we may inherit the
                        chauffeur. This arrangement is for six months. You see we live up to the
                        ideals of the simple life. The hot season is on and it is delightful.
                        Haven't yet experienced the extreme temperatures, only around 98º. So far,
                        thanks to Mrs. Maddocks, I am properly equipped for clothes. In that little
                        flame colored frock you made, Mrs. Maddocks, even my husband thought I was a
                        "pretty goil" and took me out for a journey through a magic land of wonders.
                        The evening before we had had a good two hours' walk about this district of
                        palatial homes and gardens so I suspected nothing when after our dinner
                        (always served at about half past eight) we went out into the brilliant
                        moonlight and wandered across open fields and past low-lying, flat-roofed
                        charming residences making one feel that he was walking through Castlecrag
                        some 30 years hence only not the wide outlooks; and suddenly, without
                        warning, came upon "la Martiniere" a palace for a king of kings, compared
                        with which the palaces of Europe look like thirty cents. A magic scene, an
                        astounding imaginative combination of the Grand Prix of the Beaux Arts and
                        Indian splendour, an enormous building and fascinating from every angle. I
                        shall try to get some photographs of it but photos can tell nothing. (I just
                        now went into another room and found one of the bearers sewing a button on
                        Mr. Griffin's pants.)</p>
                    <p>The trip through the great Ganges delta and the endless flat land to the
                        North was very interesting. Even where it seemed perfectly flat every bit of
                        it was terraced, with little earth dikes everywhere. You realized what
                        painstaking care was taken to preserve the water and the</p>

                        of the Gumti River on whose banks lies Lucknow. Walt met me with the car and
                        within an hour we were at the drafting board. Next morning, Sunday, the
                        first draftsman appeared at 6 o'clock in the morning, 2 others later who
                        stayed till 7. However the general plan for the Exposition will be

                    <p>10 June, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Mrs. Nicholls - You should
                        see us at our meals being served by two butlers. At breakfast for instance,
                        the one brings in 2 plates and sets them before us then stands at attention
                        in the door of the butler's pantry while the other brings in two eggs on
                        toast. No.1 majestically pours lime juice in our two glasses or brings
                        coffee, the other brings a tiny stand with two pieces of toast. No.1
                        presently follows with melons or mangoes or such. (And by Jove they know how
                        to raise melons, no neighboring pumpkins to spoil their flavor as in
                        Australia.) How's that for a woman who has always refused to have a servant
                        in the house. Tonight we walked to town to a 6:30 movie, planning to have
                        our dinner at nine, but no escape for Walt. A messenger came for him to the
                        movie and when it was over he had to go to the United Provinces Office. They
                        sent me home in a car and Heaven only knows when we'll get our dinner. But
                        never mind, we'll have two butlers when it does come. We marvel at the most
                        satisfactory achievements of your husband. What a record! Marion Mahony
                        Griffin to Mrs. Nicholls.</p>

                    <p>holidays like you, others take them, but still others have them forced upon
                        them. The last seems to be my case covering my journeys around and across
                        the continents of North America (Where Griffin's practice was in 14 States),
                        Australia, Europe and now Asia. In most ways it would have been more
                        advantageous to have stayed at home for I could doubtless have accomplished
                        more than I have to show for forty year's work but my compensation must be
                        in having started things possibly in wide areas. Alexander had to conquer
                        peoples to spread his culture. The British have already at one time or
                        another conquered the countries in advance of us, for other purposes no
                        doubt.</p>
                    <p>I do not know yet whether it will be effective on my part but I have found
                        out that <hi rend="ul">there is a vast field for enterprise</hi> amongst
                        this 400,000,000 who are dissatisfied with their economic paucity and are
                        finding political amelioration slow and painful. (We have to realize that
                        here the British deliberately destroyed a highly developed industrial
                        system, though not a mechanical one, ruthlessly in order to create a market
                        for her own industrial products. The case was very different in other
                        regions where she found quite primitive civilizations.) Private local
                        capitalism is practically confined to the thrifty Parses who seem to be the
                        small nucleus about which a prosperous India will have to grow. Through
                        these some modern industries such as steel works and banks are already
                        supplying employment for skill and talent at rates consistent with a
                        suitable standard of living. The British also destroyed the unity of India
                        by making separate States where there were Moslem majorities. <note>This
                            last sentence is handwritten and has been inserted into the

                        India, London (for he has enjoyed his visits with Marguerite there) and home
                        to Chicago. I have not yet seen a cloud since I came as here on the mainland

                        are evergreen everywhere in these Northern Provinces and the gardens are
                        green. What a place for our out-door theatre. Walter Burley Griffin to Gene

                    <p>4 June 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric Nicholls. - The sun
                        rises and sets a pure white these days. Today was full of incidents. In the
                        morning, the contractor, a fine intelligent looking man, like an Arab, came
                        in to make sure he understood the blueprint we sent him yesterday for the
                        second story of a city building in a conspicuous position, the first story
                        being already constructed. It is a strategic position to attract much
                        attention. Later the general electric man (Indian) concerned with the
                        electric fountain and Electric Tower building of the Exposition noticed the
                        drawing of the interior of the picture theatre in the above building which I
                        had just finished penciling, and was much interested in the lighting scheme,
                        a series of diminishing bands from floor to ceiling concealing the lamps,
                        each band a different color and he began to realize that Walt knew his
                        business in that line. He wanted to know if Walt was doing the pylons in the
                        exposition that way which he was.</p>
                    <p>After lunch the boys began making five blue prints of the Exposition plan and
                        Walt who had been working on it since 6 A.M. had time to shave. I in the
                        meantime had gone out to the show grounds with a very attractive man
                        (English) who has charge of all the public plantings of Lucknow, is
                        apparently energetic and has charge of the gardening of the show, and is now
                        hard at work on it since he has a blue print of Walt's design for
                        plantations. It was my first daylight tour of the city proper, we living in
                        the South East and the show being to the North West of the City.</p>
                    <p>The buildings surrounding the grounds are beautiful palaces, temples and
                        tombs, and will form a wonderful background for the exposition. At about 4

                        official, came in and an electrician, and a general conference "was had." I
                        got out of the way but some important points were discussed and I think very
                        satisfactory conclusions will be arrived at within a few days, one on the
                        superintendence which Walt made clear must, if they wanted the speed
                        necessary to be ready in December, be in the designer's hands and paid for
                        for no one would take him seriously if he wasn't paid for. The man who is
                        trying to push himself into that place, Hussain, and is saying he will do it
                        for nothing is a perfect nuisance and an utter incompetent but has a
                        political pull. He is in a position to hand over the Mohammedan vote.</p>

                        it over with Walt and it is quarter to seven. I am going now for my 2nd
                        daily bath to tidy up for an 8:30 dinner. One can do these things when all
                        personal and domestic things are cared for by many hands. This Mr. Gupta is
                        of the family who, a thousand years ago, were the rulers of the whole of
                        India, the only Indian Kings who ever ruled the whole of India.</p>

                        for whom he is planning a house, the sketch plans for which I got ready for
                        him to take along, re a subdivision scheme of about 40 acres which looks as
                        if it might be interesting. On his way back he will stop at Cawnpore to see

                    <p>Tell Nicholls I have snitched a blue print of the plan to send him. Walt is
                        sadly disappointed in his wife because she didn't bring on two perfectly
                        good pairs of garters and his present ones are done for. Do see if you can
                        find them. Think they are in a drawer of the case in the South Bedroom. Have
                        sent your cute letter about the babes and the boots, etc. on to my sister.
                        Dear Miss Drummond, how wonderful that you are at Castlecrag. Do hope it
                        will prove practical for you to be there permanently. Dear Mrs. Evers, I was
                        so glad you got over to see me. I should not have been satisfied if I hadn't
                        been able to get in touch with you before leaving. I have thought many times
                        of how true your words were that every Anthroposophist is a potential enemy
                        of the Anthro. Society. That is bound to be the case so long as we are
                        dominated by our personal opinions and our feelings. What a task and what a
                        responsibility we have. Your darling tapestry hand-bag is with me
                        constantly.</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Searby, Brindel tells us what a marvelous symbol is that of our
                        civilization, the 5th period, the lovely five-pointed star, but we must
                        beware and not use it with the point downward as in the emblem of the Soviet
                        Republic which signifies materialization, but with the</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 127 ====]</p>
                    <p>point upward so that our free will, the quality of the 5th period, may bear
                        us up from the fourness <note>i.e., four-ness</note> of the material -
                        warmth, air, water, solidity - into the spiritual realms by means of the
                        etheric forces which create the material realm - heat, light, sound and
                        life. (Curiously enough the smashing of the atom has proved there is no
                        matter, only form held in place by forces. Thus are the West and the East
                        brought together.)</p>
                    <p>I finished the working drawings for Dr. Batia's house adjacent to the
                        University buildings, and construction is started though he hasn't got his
                        complete specifications yet. I am sending you a copy, Mr. Nicholls. Thought
                        you might show it to Mr. Pollard as the type of thing that would be nice on
                        his Castlecrag lot. We think he ought to place his house on the edge of the
                        second precipice, as that is the strategic position and it will always be
                        easier to make the climb in connection with an outing on the Harbor than
                        when pressed for time when going to town. Off to a movie.</p>
                    <p>We couldn't but be interested when our draftsman, Mr. Halder (Bengali), a
                        very pleasant young man and proving to be a valuable draftsmen and
                        assistant, watchful and helpful in all sorts of ways and knowing the Hindi
                        language as well as his own and the English, so a valuable interpreter -
                        told us early this week that on Friday many thousands of people would be
                        traveling to the Ganges to pray and bathe on Friday the 19th because of the
                        eclipse of the Sun and 3 conjunctions and two squares - because, as I told
                        him, with Walt's squares to the Sun in the Zenith, etc. it was no wonder he
                        was having a rumpus with those in governmental positions. We could only hope
                        that he had made some headway in conquering his planets as is the task of
                        present-day humanity. Well two days later Mr. Shivdasanni, in charge of the
                        exposition, came over with a hashed revision of the plan by the bad man of
                        the story, Hosain <note>Hussain?</note>, to put it up to Walt to accept all
                        the ridiculous changes. In the mean time however Walt had seen the Chairman
                        of the Exhibit, Mr. Carnegie, and had a good talk with him putting the case
                        right. We think he must have</p>

                        Walt. That was Wednesday. From then till this noon (when the eclipse was
                        over) we have been on a drafting drive from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. tracing the
                        plan over, complying where possible with the silly suggestions, but
                        introducing them in such a way as not to mess up the plan and really taking
                        advantage of the retracing to add some lovely touches. I'll have to describe
                        them to you some day. The plan, we think, is truly Anthroposophic, organic,
                        the fertilizing of the lotus flower - the square penetrating the circle.</p>
                    <p>Well today at 5 P.M. was a committee meeting at which Mr. Shivdasanni said
                        that Walt was in entire charge of the construction, and he repeated the
                        statement at the formal meeting. So it looks as if the chief thing needed
                        was won, the battle over and the victory Walt's which does not mean we are
                        expecting an easy time but that apparently the way has been made possible
                        for carrying on.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that the only way to carry on business in India is in your
                        own home. Any time of day or night is right for business. Shivdasanni and
                        his right hand man, Mr. Goshal, a good friend of ours in all the issues that
                        come up, showed up here tonight shortly after eight and they are still at it
                        after nine which means we have had no supper yet. With half an hour's
                        intermission at times during the day it is amazing what hours one can put in
                        drafting without being worn out by it. That last letter of yours was a mean
                        one promising titbits of Deirdre and then not giving them. Next time begin

                    <p>experience and in the enchanting surroundings - and with an artist for a
                        cook. The Pentecostal Festival drew a crowd both evenings with many new
                        faces. The Mozart and Faust evenings were charming. Lute used it as a sort
                        of dress rehearsal for a performance she and her students were putting on at
                        Hopewood House. Besides these musical evenings we had three lectures taken
                        by Mr. Lightband, Mr. Herbert and myself. The social atmosphere was a little
                        divided by the fact that several with a little group of friends got so
                        involved in domesticity and a high sense of office respectively that they
                        had no time to attend the lectures. It was a happy time and the weather was
                        glorious.</p>
                    <p>Do you know that by way of perpetuating your good work on Sunday evenings I
                        am taking the lead at the Nicholls'? So far there has been very lively
                        interest and Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls are both very keen to have a group
                        meeting at Castlecrag. Glyn produces his books the moment he sees me. It has
                        become the order of the day that he and I shall engage in story telling the
                        moment I arrive. At table he asked for a helping of crocodile referring to
                        sardines on a wee dish. The word has only just appeared in his vocabulary.
                        He told me yesterday in a whisper that when he is a big, big boy he is going
                        to have a baby sister. Whether there is any truth in this statement or not I
                        do not know. I did not repeat so great a confidence to his Mother. The
                        little Cragites have lost temporarily a marvelous friend in you. Mrs.
                        Nicholls told me that when she knew that you were not to be in Castlecrag on
                        her return from Melbourne she didn't want to come back at all even. You have
                        heard perhaps of Mrs. Trinick's achievement - twins! A heart's desire
                        apparently amazing though this sounds. As a result of being X-rayed to
                        ascertain some weeks before the findings were for one child, so the twins
                        caused considerable astonishment. When I stopped to ask Ida (Leeson) for a
                        message for you she grumpily said, "Tell her it's time they came home
                        again." Affectionately, Florence Birch to Marion Mahony Griffin</p>

                        Mexico but I know the appeal of the tropics. She ought to be able to teach
                        Miss Reynolds the tricks of how to live comfortably in a hot country. The
                        chief thing we have found is kerosene which seems to be the essence of all
                        the curative qualities of the vegetable kingdom. It takes the itch and sting
                        out of all bites; on the floor - mop the floor with any of the kerosene
                        preparations - and no fleas, etc. will come or stay in the house; kerosene
                        put on a tick on your skin and he will promptly withdraw. It cures bull ant

                    <p>12 July, 1936 - Lucknow - Dear Father - from Walter Burley Griffin - The
                        story of Canberra and my efforts there through local jealousy has been
                        repeated in miniature with this Exposition. Again my coming into the
                        undertaking has interfered with ambitions for knighthood, etc. and for two
                        months the Director was bamboozled into making four successive starts until
                        he realized that the precious time was slipping by without getting any
                        "forrader" and on the 19th June announced that thenceforth I was in full
                        charge of the construction. After that I was able to get the surveys and
                        assistance all along the line needed to enable me to design the 57 varieties
                        of buildings and fix their locations and levels together with the quarter
                        mile of terracing, three acre fountain basin, 25,000 seat stadium, quarter
                        mile track, etc., etc., and last week a contract was let to a Cawnpore firm
                        to carry out the whole.</p>
                    <p>The buildings, aside from the amusement section, will cover half a million
                        square feet. They will be rich with sculpture and ornament all flood-lighted
                        in colors from sources concealed within themselves and form a consistent
                        white city with roofs as well as walls consisting of clay with tinted
                        whitewash. All building materials are of local origin in the strictest
                        sense, and the framework will be chiefly of bamboo.</p>

                    <p>Vaults and domes will surmount some thirty of the buildings. The employment
                        of bamboo, Jaffrey (basket) and clay with brick partitions and division
                        walls throughout was my own notion and got me the job of planning after the
                        whole had been worked out for a scheme based on the corrugated iron such as
                        was used at the last Indian exposition at Allahabad in 1910. Almost to the
                        finish there was keen competition amongst the contractors at an even lower
                        price. The buildings will cost less (8 annas) than one shilling and two
                        pence sterling per square foot with the outer work of stadium, fountain
                        basin (Concrete) and enclosure walls and fencing over a mile long thrown in.</p>
                    <p>The rainy season came 6 weeks ahead of time on June 1st so that there could
                        not have been much of the construction carried out so far but it is to be
                        hoped it will let up correspondingly early for the contract requires
                        completion in October. We have really enjoyed the wet weather in Lucknow.
                        The heat has been no longer oppressive as it was in April and May but for
                        the most part very comfortable. I am sure you would have enjoyed it. Marion
                        is back at the drawing board, effectively too, and apparently enjoying
                        tossing off decorative panels of the elevations which have the effect of
                        stopping argument on the principle that the client appreciates, it
                        understands, the plan when the stove is colored pink, the sink green and the
                        bathtub blue. What I would have done without her at this juncture I don't
                        know because although my Bengali baboo <note>babu, i.e., clerk</note> who
                        has been with me from February is an efficient draftsman now, the other and
                        temporary hands besides talking another language than ours have ideas and
                        methods equally different.</p>
                    <p>The Gumti river has been in flood for a week, covering the amusement section
                        of the Exposition site and also, to a height of six feet, one of the houses
                        I am building near the University. I was not consulted as to the site of
                        this latter though I queried it as to the danger and was assured that it was
                        above flood lines. The present flood is 6 feet below the high water mark of
                        the last and greatest flood, of 1923,</p>

                        otherwise they surely will have on their hands the greater part of the area
                        which is still unoccupied. Shortly after I came here a Parliamentary
                        Investigating Committee reproved this Trust at Lucknow for not having
                        obtained expert Town Planning advice but so far as I know up to now they
                        have done nothing about it. Three times lately I have had to visit Cawnpore,
                        on the Ganges, in connection with the Exposition, and once, last week, I
                        spent a day at Naini Tal in the "Hills," the Summer Capital of these
                        Provinces. It takes a night and half a day to get there by meter gauge

                        those of four kulis <note>coolies</note> carrying a "dandi," or those of a
                        pony. Most of the visitors use the "dandi" but I bought an umbrella and
                        walked and climbed for five hours in the rain over the spectacular scene.
                        The mountain sides of pine, cypress and deodars were layered with

                        with lots of sheet iron a la Australian resorts were disagreeable. It rained
                        during the 24 hours I was there and clouds overhung the higher Himalayas so
                        the flag did not fly from Sher ka Danda peak as it does when the snow-caps

                        cannot imagine going to all the inconvenience and suffering all the
                        disabilities in carrying on their work except that it is Government work and

                        not been on any of these trips which are hurried and on business. She has
                        not even begun to see Lucknow yet. Nor was she on the hot trip to Agra a few
                        weeks ago where I was the guest of the family of a Brahmin in the heart of
                        the old city along side the fort. Those city houses are merely ovens and the
                        Indians are realizing it only after several thousand years of trying to
                        become inured to them. My client was Mr. Mathur who has done a remarkable
                        thing in organizing the Agra Co-operative Housing Co. which is building up

                        Marion has followed we have lost you both. I'm not the one to talk. I've not
                        been expressing our appreciation of your long letters - but I have been
                        missing them. You seem ages away. I'll be as bad as Dad - and he finds it
                        hard to take - How he does think he hates India! You seem absolutely lost to
                        him - and he finds it hard to take. Roy <note>Lippincott, Genevieve's
                            husband</note> is now British. His naturalization papers are a fact. The

                        was most amazed at the attitude. Roy explained that Mr. Boyle says nobody
                        ever signs it. He sends it out - his duty is done - finis.</p>
                    <p>To return to your venture - we are most interested - the actual living

                        work it must be fascinating though I should think that all Indians to work
                        with would be most trying (Which was quite contrary to the fact M.M.G.). Am

                        Coe. She is a remarkable teacher. Do send father frequent notes, just so he
                        can feel in touch. The copies Marion used to send I would read to him - once
                        or twice even and then he'd take them off and study them by himself. If you
                        had seen him this time you would realize that quick and keen as he is, he is

                        somersaults is her latest thrill. The blue dragon in the center of your
                        Chinese rug known as "Griffin's lizard" is the taking off ground. With her
                        head placed on this and a good aim she ends up with feet on the twin lizards
                        in each corner in turn. She hung about me while I poured tea for a visitor,
                        grumbling about something. When I turned my attention to her and found out
                        what it was, she said- "That big thing is sitting on Griffin's lizard!"
                        Obviously there was no doubt in her mind as to the relative importance of
                        the woman and the lizard. I found an excuse to move her chair and Deirdre
                        ran outside quite happy again. I'll send your clothes and Mr. Griffin's

                        anticipated all my life. I set out desperately to be economical, no hot
                        water for baths, no tea, no coffee, only the most seasonable fruits and
                        vegetables, saving electric current by leaving only one light on in the
                        evening and retiring early, daylight saving by rising at 5:30 a.m. power
                        saving by turning off the electric refrigerator at night and by allowing
                        only one punkah fan to run at a time - net result:-<lb/> 1st fuel bill Rs 20

                        to one of the Bearers. Inspection of the rendered accounts for bakery,
                        dairy, grocery for which I have insisted that only orders signed by me
                        should be acknowledged show that last month Marion and I consumed 30 quarts
                        of milk, 33 loaves of bread and 40 pounds of sugar. We are both in good
                        health but Marion is no fatter than usual and I find my weight for the first
                        time down to what it was when I left this hemisphere 23 years ago, i.e. 137
                        pounds. In all our household supplies for June amounted just under Rs. 200
                        in addition to the part of the wages of the staff that I pay - Rs 135. Such
                        is life in India, the cheapest place in the world to live and where the <hi

                        difficulty lies, in the kitchen, but under the circumstances I have not
                        taken the drastic action that I should if these were my own staff and the

                    <p>13 July 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls - Although
                        there are still perhaps a dozen or so of the 60 odd different types of
                        buildings of the Exposition for which elevations have not been sketched,
                        they are mostly the insignificant service buildings. The contract has been
                        let to a Cawnpore firm for 7 and one half annas per foot. This is less than
                        my original estimate but the largest Lucknow contractor and the wealthiest
                        and most liked by all was willing to take it for one half anna less so his
                        manager told me. Doubtless there was some political reason for not accepting
                        his bid. In their present mood both the proprietors and the contractors are
                        disposed to let me work out the most economical way of getting the result.
                        The present unpopularity of my enemy, Hosain <note>Hussain?</note>, is
                        evidenced by the visit this morning of his wealthy client, Bhargava, who has
                        asked me to redesign the large house for Bhargava's brother and to take
                        charge of the construction hereafter. The house I am building for Dr. Batia,
                        half way up now is six feet under water! What it is like after its bath
                        remains to be seen (it came through all right) Walter Burley Griffin to Eric
                        M. Nicholls</p>
                    <p>The location of the Exposition is in the North West section of Lucknow which
                        was central when Lucknow had a million inhabitants, and it is the focus of
                        the main roads today as well as of historical interest.</p>

                    <p>In India it didn't take long for me to have the same feeling of being at home
                        with the people of this wonderful civilization that Mr. Griffin had
                        expressed. This in spite of the fact that their social system and their ways
                        of thinking are as utterly different from ours as their language which is
                        almost impossible for a European to learn. You simply can't understand the
                        simplest sentence even knowing the words and having memorized the sentence
                        and knowing the meaning. It simply doesn't make sense. The whole matter is
                        so reversed and so</p>
                    <pb n="137"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 137 ====]</p>
                    <p>strangely related that you can't twist your thinking into its form. However
                        the atmosphere is one of a people completely alive, with all capacities
                        functioning, deep interests and great enthusiasms and confidence, no vestige
                        of the fears which dominate the life of the European peoples and shatter
                        their soul forces. There is a great interest in modernism but no tendency to
                        limit enterprise to the material to the elimination of soul and spiritual
                        qualities and output. In material ways it looks as if India would be
                        accomplishing in fifty years what it has taken America a hundred and fifty
                        years to accomplish.</p>
                    <p>The menace lies in the possibility of its becoming a centralized movement
                        whereas the urgent need throughout modern countries is for decentralization,
                        especially functionally - three types of organization - each independent of
                        the others - to meet the needs of the body, of the soul and of the spirit of
                        human beings in a society, each organization as different in form and scope
                        as these three entities of the human being are. It would be a pity if India
                        had to go the circuitous way in the solving of her problems that Europe has
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>She has a great advantage over Mexico (the mass of whose people has likewise
                        never come under the domination of Rome in either Juridical or imperial
                        thinking or customs) in that she has highly developed intellectual
                        capacities which belong to the Post-Atlantean stream of evolution whose
                        function down through the immediately past millenniums has been to develop
                        man's thinking powers whereas the American-Indian peoples dropped out of the
                        stream in going to the West from Atlantis instead of East, and retained the
                        picture consciousness universal in those long past times.</p>
                    <p>It is a pity Mexico cannot get the benefit of democratic instead of imperial
                        thinking from her nearest neighbor - the United States - to enable her and
                        the United States to develop together the double form of
                        picture-plus-rational thinking which is the essence of 20th Century thinking
                        now overdue. Perhaps that change is now coming about.</p>

                    <p>The consequence in India is that when the European tries to match his
                        intellect against that of the Indian or Moslem, he finds he hasn't a chance.
                        We were interested in the unanimity of advice from Europeans here never to
                        go to law, that one would have no chance against the subtleties of the
                        thinking powers of these men.</p>
                    <p>I arrived in Lucknow just as Griffin was completing the General Plan for the
                        Exposition. Within a week the plans were completed and the specifications
                        for what terracing of the grounds was required, with location and
                        embankments for the great reflecting pool, and the specifications
                        determining the type of construction for the buildings, some of them brick
                        plastered as is universal in Lucknow, others a type he had noticed with
                        interest which is being used in some of the rural districts, a bamboo frame
                        covered with a woven basket work covered with a concrete-like mud so
                        generally used, which would make it possible to get a great variety of form
                        at a very low cost. He could also count on the use of considerable ornament
                        and filigree tracery which is used very extensively here and done at an
                        amazingly low cost.</p>
                    <p>The next weeks were devoted to driving out certain type designs which made it
                        possible to get a fairly close estimate of the total cost from the
                        contractor on the basis of area. The next six months were a terrific drive
                        for both architect and contractor to get ready for the announced opening
                        date in December. One can glimpse the difficulties when one realizes that
                        there were no drafting boards nor tee-squares in Lucknow. Finally one big
                        board was found in the Technical School, another in a Government office and
                        carpenters were set to work to make others. A couple of tee-squares turned
                        up from somewhere and we sent to Bombay for others. Neither were draftsmen
                        to be found. So finally the Government allowed some eight or ten of the
                        senior Technical school boys to get credits from their work in our office
                        which filled two big rooms of the house.</p>
                    <p>So these young fellows in their teens came into what might be called a
                        kindergarten of architecture. None had ever used a tee-square.</p>
                    <pb n="140"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 140 ====]</p>
                    <p>They were a fine set of young fellows and though I spent most of my time
                        driving and scolding them, they called me "Mother" and had a real affection
                        for me as I had for them. But with a design a day to be turned out, sketches
                        completed and rendered for exhibition and publication to be sent all over
                        India, and working drawings during the whole six months and endless details
                        for the structures, and forms all new, it was a task one wouldn't care to
                        undertake more than once in a lifetime.</p>
                    <p>At the same time there was a continuous succession of private clients whose
                        needs had to be met. Though the draftsmen had the routine European hours,
                        since that was established in Government Offices though by no means
                        elsewhere in India, neither Mr. Griffin nor myself nor our clients were
                        bound by them for from seven o'clock in the morning till ten at night anyone
                        was likely to drop in and, as one of our most continual visitors said, he
                        had never come in, at no matter what time, that he did not find me at the
                        drafting board.</p>
                    <p>Things were complicated here again by the fact that we were working for the
                        government and up against all the delays and inefficiencies and enmities
                        that are inevitable when an outsider is brought into officialdom though in
                        this case it was the head of the Industrial Department who came to Griffin
                        and asked him to take on the work. He himself often found himself helpless
                        in the coils of the machine. The chief source of delay and difficulty was an
                        illegitimate child of half European blood with consequently an inferiority
                        complex and great motive force in obstruction.</p>
                    <p>In India, quite apart from the work being done in the office, the
                        relationship with the young men in the office and with our clientele as a
                        whole was a very interesting and delightful experience. The young students
                        brought in to help us could not be blamed for their lack of experience
                        however great a hardship the impossibility of getting experienced draftsmen
                        might be to us in meeting the obligations we took on. The connection</p>

                    <p>with them was in fact a very delightful experience. They are beautiful
                        physically, charming and appreciative in manner, earnest, devoted and
                        hardworking, and eager and enthusiastic at the opportunity of having the new
                        experience and the training that Mr. Griffin was offering them. They were in
                        fact fine, sometimes exquisite, draftsmen, or what would be more technically
                        known as tracers. One, an older man, who was with us for a while, was an
                        incredibly exquisite draftsman. Never have I seen such marvelous drawings as
                        he got out when he was given an ornamental detail to carry out for
                        publication. Rarely would a draftsman be called upon in any office today for
                        such a range and variety as was required for this exposition for, although
                        the construction was simple, the drawings were far from being simple.
                        Parabolic domes were things that solved themselves in actual construction
                        with bending bamboos, but were by no means simple problems for a draftsman
                        to solve for either elevations or sections or perspectives - sketches, plans
                        and details driven through in a few months, a greater variety than would go
                        through any architect's or a dozen architects' offices ordinarily in the
                        course of their whole experience.</p>

                    <p>One of the difficulties we ourselves were up against in delegating this work
                        instead of doing it personally arose not only from the fact that, though a
                        number of these young people spoke English apparently fluently, they, even
                        the best of them, rarely really understood an instruction which lack of
                        understanding could become apparent only after they had made the drawing.
                        But there was also the greater difficulty in that they were in fact too much
                        inclined to think things out themselves. It was extremely difficult for them
                        to take an instruction. In their own work they were in the habit of doing
                        what really came out from within themselves, carrying on one might say in
                        the blood stream the results of millenniums of experience in their own
                        particular way of expressing themselves. We ourselves marveled as we stood
                        before the workman decorating pottery with exquisite precision in the finest
                        details with no</p>

                    <p>mechanical assistance and no pattern before him, but entirely free hand and
                        direct from within. The Technical school was trying to train their students
                        to work from drawings.</p>
                    <p>We had in the office two more experienced men, Mr. Halder, a Hindu, who was
                        our head draftsman, and Mr. Mohsin, a Mohammedan, who was our
                        Superintendent, the out-door man and much older than Mr. Halder. They were
                        wonderful assistants in every way, absolutely trustworthy and most
                        painstaking and watchful of our interests in every direction. It was
                        interesting to see what a close friendship grew up between these two men,
                        one Hindu and the other Mohammedan. I had interesting discussions with Mr.
                        Halder especially when I found that he belonged to a comparatively new
                        group, the Vishnavarites, for in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
                        Vishnu though spoken of was for the Indians the unknown God, the one who had
                        not yet manifested. Mr. Halder was very devoted and conscientious in giving
                        the required time - long hours daily - to his mediations, and I as an
                        Anthroposophist could speak to him on even terms as to why Christianity,
                        resting today on faith, could not hold its own with the Indians whose
                        religion was based on knowledge, supersensible knowledge. I called his
                        attention to the fact that if he was entirely unprejudiced - that is without
                        pre-judging - (in which case he would see true in the supersensible realms)
                        his supersensible experiences would reveal to him that Vishnu was the Indian
                        name of the God who incarnated in Palestine whose name to the Europeans was
                        Christ. It would be interesting indeed if, having taken a definite stand
                        against any Christianizing in India as they have done, as is confirmed by
                        all the missionaries I had an opportunity to talk with, the Indian should
                        come, through the work of this group, in its own way, to a knowledge of
                        Christianity, of the incarnated Ego.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mohsin was a most remarkable character and really one of the persecuted
                        ones because of his absolute integrity which over and over again foiled the
                        conspiracies against us, conspiracies which are so general in Indian
                        affairs, so that he was constantly being accused of</p>

                    <p>12 August, 1936 - Dorothy Searby to Marion Mahony Griffin - I wonder if you
                        have any idea how much I appreciated that wonderful letter of yours. It was
                        so very kind of you to spend so much time on me when you are so desperately
                        busy, and you will be pleased to hear that it did me a world of good when
                        you told me how you laughed, well I laughed too, and the very fact of
                        laughing put an entirely different perspective on the matter, and I really
                        think that from now on there will always be an aspect that I shall find
                        humorous. Mack has been very good with the Anthro meetings, I do not think
                        he has missed one of them but I have missed several. You know that I find
                        that my greatest joy was the talks with you after the meeting, how's that
                        for an heartfelt compliment? Have just sent on your second community letter.
                        What a wonderful time you must be having. It has always been one of the
                        dreams of my life to visit India. I really intend to one of these days when
                        the children are on their feet and I can be free. I would not mind hiking
                        through India with a begging bowl if there were no other way to see it. You
                        will remember how Mack and I hiked across from San Francisco to Chicago
                        dragging the babies in a cart. The parts I want most to see are the Northern
                        parts, the Kashmir valley and the mountains up from the valley toward Leh.
                        Perhaps I'll get that trip yet. Dorothy Searby to Marion Mahony Griffin</p>
                    <p>15 August. 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - We adore
                        the tales about Deirdre, "the trees having a fighting game" was amazing and
                        we shouted with laughter over "that big thing is sitting on Griffin's
                        lizard." As to your "enjoying having a finger in the pie" we think you are
                        in it with both hands having practically made the pie. The exposition has
                        been under construction for some three or four weeks but there have been
                        torrential rains almost every day so walls are being carried up only four
                        feet but all over the place. They want a dome completed by the</p>

                    <p>end of next week when the Governor is making a visit here. The Gumti went
                        higher than in last month's flood and some 4,000 buildings in Lucknow
                        collapsed. The powers and potentates come in day by day and jobs outside the
                        show are piling up. The latest is the modernizing of a hundred of the 500
                        rooms of a former Raja's 500 wives, by a descendant whose quota is about one
                        fifth, for the renovation of which Walt will be making sketches shortly. He
                        has quoted him Rs. 2,500 for plans. The publisher of the Wild Life Magazine
                        brought him this job. He is greatly interested in Walt's architecture, says
                        it is original. The plans for the Agra subdivision go tomorrow, charge Rs.
                        400. These figures are for Mr. Nicholls' benefit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Searby, (a chiropractor) you will be interested in the following
                        quotation from Dr. Steiner:- "The etheric streams follow the path of the
                        nerves." As you know the etheric forces are the life forces. I sent you a
                        clipping about the cobra. It is wonderful to have wild peacocks light in
                        your yard and wander around, and to see monkeys around who can take care of
                        themselves. And every night we hear the lions roar (only that is because the
                        Zoo is so near). What a pity it is to be honest. It spoils so many good
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>The other night we were walking to a movie when we encountered a stream
                        across the road. I didn't want to wade across it in my new cream shoes (you
                        know Mrs. Maddocks) so Walt carried me across pick-a-back. Just then with a
                        footman running ahead to make sure the crossing was safe, along came a
                        resplendent coach and four in all its panoply and some 8 or more people in
                        this commodious sort of charabank <note>large open carriage?</note> in full
                        view with the Rajah of Jahangirabad in the rear seat so he got a full view
                        down the retreating road. Among his guests was the Governor. All that is not
                        completely true in this story is that Walt insisted on our waiting standing
                        by till this magnificence had passed before he would carry me across
                        dangling on his neck, so the Rajah missed a sight I am sure he would have
                        enjoyed.</p>

                    <p>The contractor of the Exposition is a youth (English) 21 years old, and at
                        present he is living with us. He seems a pleasant youth and I hope the task
                        doesn't prove too heavy for him. Of course he has elder partners (Indians)
                        though it is he who inherited his father's business. He was born and has
                        lived all his life in India and is very sympathetic with the Indians. He was
                        laid up two days this week with a fever.</p>
                    <p>We have had a very sad thing happen this month. One of our bearers, Das, the
                        majestic one I spoke of, died so suddenly one night that it was thought at
                        first he must have been bitten by a snake. We all went out to their
                        quarters, a group of buildings on the border of the compound - and his
                        little wife sobbed in my arms for an hour and more crying "Mon Raja, mon
                        Raja est mouri" - My king, my king is dead - (see the resemblance to
                        French). She stopped only when one of the gardeners, a Brahmin (of the
                        highest caste but working as a day-laborer with the others - in the
                        gardening - you see how we misunderstand the caste business) said "you must
                        stop crying, Memsahib (myself) tells you to stop crying." There are seven
                        children. Das had been bearer to the Editors of the Pioneer for 25 years and
                        they are providing for the family who have returned to their home town where
                        the grandmother lives.</p>
                    <p>Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks - I can only add a footnote to Marion's
                        account of the happenings here, much abridged as that is. First to wish you
                        many happy returns of your birthday since the simple memento sent you,
                        posted a week ago, will be long in coming. The rough spots of our track with
                        the exposition have by no means all been smoothed out and because of the
                        deep-seated motives and persistence of our few opponents we have to make
                        continual fresh starts and sidetrack efforts in the face of time limits
                        which do not provide for that sort of thing. The official Director is a weak
                        vacillating type who interrupts and diverts to meet nonessentials and yields
                        to fears which are pumped into him incessantly, and makes important
                        decisions without consulting me. If not reversed, sooner or later these
                        would destroy our scheme entirely as is the</p>

                    <p>20 August 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls -
                        Another battle royal fought and won. Day before yesterday Walt sent in his
                        resignation to the Exposition Director. Yesterday, in the presence of the
                        Minister, the Director agreed to Walt's requirements, and today at 7 a.m.
                        everybody is over at the grounds welcoming the Governor who is here to see
                        how things are getting on. The enemy who has a Hitleresque power with the
                        Director fought tirelessly for his various destructive points but lost on
                        all of them. Walter's three requirements were First:- that his plan should
                        be considered as final and no changes to be made except omissions if the
                        Governor found they couldn't afford them, leaving the way open to build if
                        means were found later. Second:- Control of all money expended thus control
                        of contractor who was inclined to take the enemy's advice and cut out
                        everything except raw construction since he is being paid per square foot of
                        area of foundations. Now he will be paid only on Walter's certificate.
                        Third:- That decisions on all matters, final ones, could be made by the
                        Director's brother who lives here so is constantly available and who is
                        sympathetic to making the show beautiful instead of a shanty town. This
                        meant that some work already done over Walt's head in the wrong place will

                    <p>The package you sent arrived much to our satisfaction. Walt's eyes stuck out
                        when he saw the box of chewing gum. He immediately took one of his kind and
                        I one of my kind. The next day when he saw me chewing he asked me if it was
                        the same piece I had taken the day before. As a result of long training and
                        consequently an understanding of how a wife ought to meet such a situation,
                        I refused to tell him. The next time</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 147 ====]</p>
                    <p>I wanted a piece of gum I couldn't find the box. I accused him of hiding it.
                        He denied, but the next day he produced the box. Peace now reigns in the
                        family.</p>
                    <p>Genevieve <note>Lippincott, WBG's sister</note>, Walt is writing to Father
                        oftener than monthly though probably the boats don't get them over oftener.
                        We enjoy our association with the Indian people very much though in our wild
                        rush at present we contact only those connected with our work but an
                        architect's work brings him in touch with all sorts of people. I have been
                        thrilled from the beginning with how many handsome men there are. One sees
                        every European type only instead of being homely <note>"ugly" has been
                            crossed out</note> as our menfolk are (father excepted) these are
                        perfectly beautiful. We rarely see the women though I have glimpsed several
                        lovely ones. Occasionally a man brings his wife along to see the strange
                        Mrs. Griffin, architect and draftsman, working at her drafting board twelve
                        hours a day. They always have the satisfaction of finding me there. When
                        here one realizes that India can never be unified nor have a feeling for
                        humanity as a whole until the seclusion of women ends. There is no way of
                        their knowing each other. There is no social life, only family life except
                        in the small villages where there is some neighborliness. This is a general
                        statement. There is a very considerable number of individual women who are
                        getting a thorough education and are functioning in community affairs,
                        including exhibiting and lecturing at the Exposition.</p>
                    <p>Lillian <note>Lillian Hamilton Moore?</note>, you remember the darling
                        contraption you gave me some years ago, the necklace of sewing equipment. I
                        let Walt bring it over with him. It is one of our constant companions and
                        reminder of you. Was sorry not to have been able to send you the pointers re
                        the Haven Theatre shows for publication but the pressure hasn't given us a
                        moment. And Dorothy <note>Searby</note>, you can rest easy re the Teddy bear
                        mascot you gave me. The little Koala is being well cared for. Our Siamese
                        cats Minnie and Monster had a family of four kittens and as they get older
                        and scamper off on their own, much to the anxiety of their mother, she takes
                        much satisfaction in taking Koala off my dressing table, walking off with
                        him</p>
                    <pb n="148"/>

                    <p>and mothering this foster child. Every time I put him back, down she takes
                        him. These Siamese cats are more like dogs than cats, demand attention, want
                        to be talked to. If I don't pay attention to Monster he gets up on his hind
                        legs with his front paws on my legs and gazes into my face. If I don't pet
                        and talk to him he jumps upon me as if he were climbing a tree, not at all
                        pleasant with my thin clothes, now I pay attention to him when he demands
                        it. At times it is quite a problem to keep him from settling under my chin
                        on my drawings or letters to lie for hours. Our Indian draftsmen watch to
                        see how I treat Monster. I'm sure I'm being judged thereby.</p>
                    <p>9 a.m. Well they are just back from the Governor's visit and the roll of
                        drawings is here, so I must to breakfast and then to my task. I have a
                        regular kindergarten of architecture here, ten draftsmen who are having to
                        do tasks quite beyond them so I have to teach them projection, etc. and keep
                        my eyes peeled for mistakes all the time.</p>
                    <p>The contractor's manager - Ishmael an Indian - is a very fine and interesting
                        man and likes to talk Anthro with me as does our head draftsman Mr. Halder.
                        Just received Miss Birch's letter with the great news about Stella Miles
                        Franklin's prize for her new book - "All That Swagger" and the promise of
                        its publication. (It is a great story. All Americans should read it - a true
                        story of pioneer life in Australia.) Love and congratulations to her.
                        Received Lute Drummond's lovely letters. Am so glad she kept the
                        Anthroposophic Fairy Tales. No time for reading them here these days. When
                        her class has translated them she could have each one write out one
                        translation and then Miss Shead could make five copies of each for the
                        Castlecrag children's library. I have a Steiner book with a number of
                        Children's and Mother's prayers. Will send some on when I get a chance to
                        translate them. Marion Mahony Griffin</p>

                        when the Youngs may return. However we are first going to shop around for a
                        lot on which to do the same thing in a different way and not lose all the
                        principal in 4 months, little though that amount may be. It does not look as
                        if our Monsoon were over for when it does not rain we drip and only when it
                        does rain is it cool. Either way is a relief however since the construction
                        can go on only when it is not raining. I have prepared a flowering shrub
                        planting list for Ronald's grave which I hope to attend to setting out

                    <p>30 August. 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to George W. Griffin -
                        Marion is working like a slave and she is the only effective help I have had
                        for this exhibition. (Mr. Molder worked only on the private jobs.) We should
                        be further ahead if we had not experimented with a dozen scratch draftsmen
                        whom she spends much time teaching and then doing their work over again.
                        However things are moving somewhat out on the grounds so that in the face of
                        the floods during July and August which covered and may again cover half the
                        site the showing was quite a surprise for the Governor whom the Public Works
                        Department had led to believe that the task was impossible.</p>
                    <p>Our boy contractor who is living with us comes home entirely discouraged at
                        each constructional problem, where his foreman talks and where detractors
                        decry. But a way seems to open immediately afterwards. Lately it was that
                        the poles sagged so that nobody would risk erecting the first 50 foot peak
                        but they did it and it was raised. Yesterday after a day's struggle the
                        bamboo ribs of domes and vaults would not bend and that because of the snake
                        season and the floods no green ones could be obtained for two months! Then a
                        good fairy came along who told us what to do and the dry bamboos are being
                        stored in the Hussainabad Tank under water for three days to make them
                        pliable.</p>
                    <p>The people here have used bamboo, jaffrey and clay all their lives but only
                        in restricted ways which are not subject to the dictates of more common
                        sense. When the latter is applied over the workers dead</p>

                    <p>bodies it usually works however just as well in India as in the West to the
                        surprise of all and sundry. The salvation of my position as well as the
                        difficulty of it lies in the limited time. There is no leisure to apply the
                        "wearing down" policy that worked so well at Canberra.</p>
                    <p>After a lapse of some months, heard from our bank job at Jhansi this week
                        when the supervisor got into deep water through having substituted
                        inadequate steel beams for the reinforced concrete roof girders I had
                        designed for the <note>Jwala</note> bank. So I paid my first visit to this
                        town about 190 miles South West spending a day there redesigning a Manager's
                        residence, redesigning the interior of the bank to provide for the
                        structural change, and detailing the exterior modeled ornament of columns,
                        cornices, etc. Here I had my first experience of modeling full size in damp
                        clay and with three or four assistants a perfect model resulted only to be
                        destroyed, before it could be copied in mortar, by urchins who ran over it.
                        So this had to be done again from scratch in position in two variations. The
                        horizontal members and ornament were modeled in lime mortar in the first
                        instance, a slower but more reliable process.</p>
                    <p>At Jhansi toward evening I went for a stroll to the old fort and historic
                        city. This veritable castle is the most impressive I have seen yet though
                        its situation is not as spectacular as that of Gwalior. It has towering
                        bastions, barbettes, bassillions <note>"Basilians" in Section I, No. 5, p.
                            112</note>, barbicans, bartizans, merlons, battlements, parapets,
                        posterns, sorti-ports, citadels and redoubts galore and in stone too. I
                        surmounted one of those rocky buttes that are characteristic of the
                        district, and the walled city lies at its base. (No wonder he was never
                        stumped in the naming of the streets of Castlecrag. M.M.G.)</p>
                    <p>Jhansi is quite unlike Lucknow or Agra or Delhi and does not seem so dense
                        and untidy. It is predominately Hindu and abounds in beautiful cylindrical
                        temples which are far more imaginistic though less comprehensive than the
                        studied Mohammedan buildings of the United Provinces.</p>

                    <p>In the parts I trudged through from 5 to 8 p.m. the people were quite
                        different in appearance, on the whole, lighter and not so hardboiled as the
                        natives of this Province. I was surprised in all this because I had known of
                        Jhansi only as a military center, and a Railway town of the Great India
                        Peninsular System. The stone is evidently intractable and is in irregular
                        chunks laid with considerable range in sizes and plenty of mortar sometimes
                        interspersed with the oriental bricks about one inch thick - which were
                        universal before the European influx - and which give a beautiful texture. I
                        also found some really beautiful brown brick of this shale-field texture
                        never intended for plastering as in the case of the United Provinces.</p>
                    <p>The overseer of our bank building was very apologetic over the various
                        liberties taken with both design and construction and for which perhaps the
                        Proprietor was as much to blame as anyone. No client or workman in India has
                        the slightest respect for plans or details even if there should be one who
                        had the slightest understanding of them which I doubt. Perhaps the next time
                        with the same parties the case may be different. The client in this case
                        admires the building such as it is, and has a site now for another
                            <note>Jwala bank</note> in Cawnpore, I believe, which he wishes me to
                        do. For journeyman Architects, such as we are, there is not much in life but
                        our trade to write about but that has its thrills along with its trials.

                        Marion Mahony Griffin - How nice of you to remember my birthday in the midst
                        of so busy a life. The gold hair band and bag pleased me immensely. I have a
                        black evening frock with which I wear a gold coat so you see your gifts
                        provide the perfect accessories. You know peacocks are anathema to the
                        superstitious. Is this a challenge to me to rule my stars and ignore timid
                        inhibitions and safety policy? I've already broken two mirrors and I'm dying
                        to flaunt this golden peacock abroad. But they are incredibly lovely birds.
                        Sometimes the things that have become banal in literature, as roses and
                        peacocks and moonlight, astonish one with fresh beauty</p>

                        until morning. I told Deirdre what you said about the battle between the
                        light and the dark making all the colors. She loves it. At sunset time in
                        the excitement of so much color she waves her arms vigorously saying "plash,
                        plash" and does twice around the lawn to give bodily expression to the
                        thrill. I was too amused to be annoyed today when Deirdre came and announced
                        that - "I swallowed an egg down the sink." I investigated and found a broken
                        shell on the drain board and realized that the contents had disappeared down
                        the plug hole of the sink. "Swallowed" was an apt term for the pause and
                        then the disappearance in one gulp of a good fresh egg down the sink pipe.
                        You have stressed this early period for the training of all the senses
                        giving wide experience to all of them. I have been lightly directing her
                        attention to scents and she has responded readily, our own scented gum, the
                        leaves of the scented angophora by the Johnston's gate, the big leaved
                        wattle on the lawn, a verbena and just now jasmine. All these she knows and
                        others too like freshly out paw-paw, pineapples and lately we had
                        strawberries. I said, "We'll wait till Edgar comes before eating them." She
                        said, "But may I smell them till Edgar comes?" which meant I hadn't the
                        heart to refuse and if a few did disappear it was hardly by conscious
                        decision on her part but a nose-hand-mouth reaction that went off on its own
                        accord. One can't wallop a kid for that.</p>
                    <p>I went to the Nicholls' to the Anthro meeting last Sunday and intend to
                        continue whenever I can leave the family. G.K. Chesterton wrote an amusing
                        poem from the dog's point of view.</p>

                    <p>It takes Anthroposophy to reveal that smells reveal the presence of the life
                        ether, and their importance in humus for gardens.</p>
                    <p>A fire broke out near the golf links on Sunday - a hot day and a breeze
                        blowing. Deans and Nicholls worked like Trojans at it and put it out. They
                        really were tireless. They packed me back when I arrived in overalls with a
                        rake on my shoulder. Nicholls said I'd be more nuisance falling over
                        precipices and such and that this wasn't the Spanish war. So they drank the
                        tea I'd brought and scrambled back to finish their difficult task. There's
                        not so much destroyed so do not be apprehensive. Your garden here is looking
                        very well. The mesembrianthemums at the gate are a blaze of color and the
                        gate painted green adds to the picture. The bottlebrush above the bamboos
                        are blooming, a very fine leaved small orange one is particularly lovely.
                        The lawn does not get much chance - there is such a traffic of children over
                        it. Many honey-eaters come to the callistemons. The children have just come
                        for crumbs to throw to them and at the moment all are quiet and pensive
                        sitting on the lawn watching them. I would like to send you a living picture
                        of them. We are on the track of another house to be built at Roseville. The
                        woman is meeting Mr. Nicholls tomorrow and seeing the Pratten houses. The
                        second Pratten house is now finished and is very lovely - that warm stone
                        and settled down on the earth (battered walls) as if it was connected with
                        the Earth's live center - not an accretion like all the houses around. I
                        would like to show it to you - like a bulb that has flowered in your
                        absence. But then - you created the bulb! How do you do it? To quote Ron

                    <p>book by Cecil Grey called "Predicaments, on Music and the Future."
                            <note>"Predicaments; or, Music and the Future" (1936)</note> It is very
                        interesting indeed especially when dealing with architecture - the arts
                        dominating in repeating sequences - "the first to awaken from its slumber
                        was unquestionably architecture (the spacial <note>spatial?</note> art using
                        the forces of Saturn, the space creator). Then sculpture, painting,
                        literature, and, in the 19th century, music. Here we have a definite
                        sequence starting from the 11th century. We are now due for another cycle
                        starting with architecture."</p>
                    <p>Today in conformity with Prof. Petrie's theory and with observable fact we
                        are living in an age dominated by anti-artistic activities such as
                        mechanics, science, wealth, but already we see emerging from it a new phase
                        of more purely artistic activity in which Architecture, as in the 11th and
                        12th centuries, is once more the dominant factor. It follows that in the
                        immediate future all the arts will aspire toward the conditions of
                        architecture. Consequently the values which will most probably characterize
                        the music of the future will be architectural values." And speaking of music
                        of the future he adds "and the kind of form most likely to characterize this
                        art is architectural form for architecture as we have seen seems destined to
                        be the archetype of the immediate future. Architecture, of all the arts, is
                        the one which is best reconciled into a unity the eternal antithetic duality
                        of classicism and romanticism. Architecture has been well expressed in the
                        well known dictum - that architecture is frozen music. The corollary that
                        music is molten architecture provides the best possible index to the nature
                        of the musical art which is to come. Its leading place during the coming
                        period is further strengthened by the fact that of all the arts architecture
                        is the least nationalistic and this may well be one of the reasons to
                        account for its almost complete eclipse during the whole of the 19th
                        century. In the second place it is the most impersonal of all the arts. The
                        art we are led to visualize then is the one neither classic nor romantic but
                        partaking of the attributes of both, monumental in style, cosmopolitan</p>

                        every part, every detail, every note even discharging its function, strictly
                        subordinate to the whole." <note>The preceding quotation probably starts at
                            the beginning of the paragraph.</note></p>
                    <p>So my dear when you come back to this earth after your sojourn in the
                        spiritual realms, having your architectural background already in this life
                        you'll be ready to float in on the new classic polyphonic idiom which is
                        awaiting the magician's wand to give it its glorious form. The whole book is
                        absorbing. I have told Nicholls about it. He is getting very interested in
                        Anthroposophy - taking it as a life necessity. He hasn't said this but it is
                        very evident.</p>
                    <p>Bim and Roma Hilder who have a large room in their new home would love to
                        have us use it for our next festival. I think we might accept it for somehow
                        there is a freedom in the home of artists which one does not get elsewhere.
                        That is why we roamed around your castle as if we were the sole proprietors.</p>
                    <p>The German groups are working hard - preparing for performances. They love
                        this cottage on the roof which is so central as well. (Right in the heart of
                        Sydney's business district - a pent house on the roof.) The sun is just
                        streaming in warming even my bare legs for although it is supposed to be
                        mid-winter I can write this in my pajamas. Nearly like India, nicht wahr? I
                        saw a film on India last Thursday, and the various views of Lucknow were
                        very lovely. Dick had to sing some of the Indian love-lyrics. It was a
                        private function. You can imagine where my thoughts were.</p>
                    <p>We're doing Mozart's "Marriage de Figaro" at the E.S.W. next Thursday in the
                        afternoon illustrated by the young singers. They enjoy rehearsing their
                        ensembles on my roof. In fact they would never go home unless forced. I have
                        a young policeman with a top "C" who is like a young Apollo more or less, so
                        the girls are nicely balanced now and I needn't go out of the studio looking
                        for tenors or baritones. They are right on the spot.</p>

                    <p>I finished the 12 lectures, Dr. Steiner's "New Art of Education" to the
                        teachers at Neutral Bay. They were all at the Indian film and are coming to
                        see me on Monday evening. They kept up their interest to the last. And Jo -
                        "Der schoene Jungling" also comes to see me. He has gone to learn speech
                        from Stewart Montgomery having at last come to realize that a careless and
                        shapeless accent is beneath the dignity of an intelligent human being. His
                        first contact with a different kind of human being, so he told me on Friday,
                        and other than the swearing and racing and batting genus, was through Mr.
                        Herbert, and on to us at Castlecrag. He wants to matriculate and go to
                        America to study at Springfield. He is coming to dine with me next Friday
                        week and show me his vowel and consonant exercises. Dora Jackson just rang
                        me and wants to be remembered to you both. Prometheus is growing a beautiful
                        boy (Born while our play of Prometheus Bound was on in the Valley.) Phyllis
                        was in Cologne when we last heard and Joan was settled in the castle in
                        Vienna doing her intensive studies and loving it all. And now many thanks
                        for all your help. I can see you with the flaming torch carrying the truth
                        of the Spirit even into the land of the Krishna and the Bhagavad Gita. Love
                        to you and Mr. Griffin, Lute Drummond.</p>
                    <p>Dear Georgine (from M.M.G.), Miss Drummond's letter arose from the fact that
                        I thought I had the promise of being a musician in my next life as in this
                        incarnation I was fulfilling a number of things Steiner says may be
                        prerequisites. I am an architect, working with form, also in mural
                        decoration, have mathematical talent, have worked with music "no matter with
                        how little effective results," etc. And we have always stressed the
                        importance of maintaining the balance and making full use of both classic
                        and romantic principles. If you wanted to send me a birthday present I'd

                        game to see how much she knew and to have great fun waiting for the results.
                        She thoroughly enjoyed them and was most amusing over them and incidentally

                        do anything wrong and bring them up good citizens. I'm not going to do that.

                        our housing. Only two months left for the exposition construction. Perhaps
                        the monsoon has ended with the most terrific downpour of all last Sunday

                        the main efforts of the builders off the brickwork onto the bamboo and
                        jaffry work at which they have been stalling heretofore, because of lack of
                        experience. The past week the skeletons of the domes have been springing up
                        like bubbles. The huge amusement area is still mostly submerged mud flat but
                        nearly every important structure outside that section is under construction.
                        Moreover the exhibitors all over India have begun to waken and the Director
                        is more encouraged to go on than to hold back and cut out.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>My solitary journey to Mahmudabad was another novel episode of India. The
                        roads being impossible for this fifty mile journey, I went by rail
                        accompanied by the young Rajah's younger brother, the only first class
                        passengers in the only first class compartment of the train or trams for we
                        had one change. The trip out took only the afternoon, but the return trip
                        lasted from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. the delays being at the junction occasioned
                        by the precarious condition of the mile-long bridge across the Golga, the
                        most unreliable of Indian rivers in its most erratic season. The altered
                        channel had been cutting down at one pier from fifteen to seventy five feet
                        below water level, i.e., to but fifteen feet from the foundation ninety feet
                        deep. Hence all the passengers on that section of the Bengal North-Western
                        had to disembark and walk across this part of the bridge to another train.
                        There is a picturesque sailboat-ferry for other kinds of vehicles. The
                        Mahmudabad railway station is one of the four villages aggregating 8,000
                        population which surround the palace separated only by the wide moat on
                        three sides and by the park into which the moat has been converted on the
                        entrance front. It has been too recently extended to be altogether charming
                        and is of the Lucknow version of Mogul architecture with Italian flavoring.</p>
                    <p>The Rajah Sahib was broadcasting Indian music to the Indian villages as he
                        does every evening from phonograph records, and we viewed the scene from the
                        upper story balconies. For three nights I occupied,</p>

                        gateway and finest gardens of the forecourt. Opening off the dining room the
                        Rajah's room was ascetic by comparison with that of his guest opening from
                        the drawing room.</p>
                    <p>The first morning I selected the site for the new <note>Mahmudabad</note>
                        library for 100,000 books choosing, from the three alternatives, the one
                        just outside the moat and overlooking a long reach of it. Previously in the
                        evening I had been taken out a mile or two to a spot alongside a tank where
                        I am to build a modest cottage for the two brothers converting the pond into
                        a "paka" swimming pool at the same time. This is so that the Rajah may have
                        a place he "can call his own" escaping from an existence for all the world
                        like that of Henry VIII as characterized in the film where Charles Laughton
                        was unable to escape from his courtiers by any strategy.</p>

                    <p>After that we looked at some of the thousands of books, stored in the third
                        floor towers, of the library that is to be devoted to Indiana or perhaps
                        less ambiguously, Indianiana. There for the first time I viewed the rings of
                        Saturn and the moons of Jupiter through a telescope.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon we had popcorn for afternoon tea because I had asked about
                        that kind of Indian corn, and with the help of a compass and a globe we
                        worked out the bearing of Mecca from Mahmudabad and found that its angle
                        with the axis of the palace was about 30°. Hence for the Mosque for the
                        family which I am asked to build, I selected an angle in the wall between
                        the main compound and the Zenana Court yard for a hexagonal "bastion" mosque
                        which with its mihrab properly pointed toward Mecca will not clash in its
                        grouping with the surroundings as does practically every Mosque I have seen
                        including those adjoining the Exposition I am building and that with which I
                        have planned the Pioneer building to parallel. It is intended that this
                        small mosque shall be as "modern" as was the first that was worked out in
                        the terms of the Koran and</p>

                    <p>I agreed to remain a second day for an inspection of the Belahra Palace, 11
                        miles distant, founded by one of the Rajah's ancestors who was sent by the
                        Mogul Emperor to subdue this unruly outpost and who did so. His final heirs
                        are the two sisters to whom the Mohammedan brothers are now married and the
                        estates henceforth are merged. The original brothers agreed so well on most
                        everything that they had the same architect for their forts and chose almost
                        identical furnishings, bric-a-brac, paintings, etc., but Belahra has been
                        much less added to and has an elevated site and is on that account more
                        picturesque especially on the side of its ramp approaches. It took half a
                        day to traverse the various rooms and courts and to appraise the repairs and
                        alterations necessary to convert this into a Durban <note>durbar?, i.e., a
                            court or public audience</note> building which we are commissioned to do
                        at the same time giving to it something more of oldtime character of
                        fortress than it now has. Can you imagine anything more congenial to me?</p>
                    <p>We had expected to have to make this little journey by elephant but couriers
                        brought word that the road was possible for car which proved to be precisely
                        right. Possibly to preclude any disappointment on my part an elephant
                        followed on in the afternoon and we set out in a shikar into the surrounding
                        meadows and marshes, seven of us on the elephant's back with an ox-cart load
                        of "monskere" - jesters - four footmen and four horsemen - and one
                        bicyclist. Our host, the president of the Wild Life Preservation Conference
                        of India is also the President of the United Province Association for the
                        Preservation of Game, and had therefore no very bad conscience when he
                        bagged only a snake, a pigeon and two other birds suitable for the kulis
                            <note>coolies</note> of the party. The peacocks we saw kept too far out
                        of range and we did not find anything else, but on viewing the sunset from
                        the castle on our return, all voted it the end of a perfect day.</p>

                        because I had been led to expect nothing else. They seem to believe that by
                        accustoming oneself early to rich food one can survive on it but the
                        comparatively early demise of all their regal progenitors hardly supports
                        the argument. Though I was somewhat upset in my digestive tract the last
                        night after this high living and the little dinner I ate, I noted that the
                        Rajah himself skipped it altogether and did not even appear at breakfast

                        Mahony Griffin - The only personal word we have had from you lately is "both
                        well and working." We think you are marvels to keep it up so many months. I
                        hope December will bring a pause from work. Will you please keep half a
                        dozen of those albums of sketches of the Exposition buildings such as you
                        sent me. Several people want mine and I won't give it up but they want it so
                        badly that I fear me they'll pinch it if I let it get out of my hands. Here
                        it has caused quite a stir of appreciation and admiration and affection for
                        you folks.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday I took some visitors over to the Pratten houses, then to afternoon
                        tea with Eunice Cameron. Her garden is flourishing with many lovely rock
                        plants most of which you suggested to her. She offered me cuttings and
                        roots. I am to go another day because with Halloween on my hands I'd not
                        have the time to spend a day planting them out just now. "The Pinnacle" is
                        let to Miss Stella Scroggie. Did I tell you that the indirect lighting in
                        our Barbette house is a great success. There were many doubts expressed
                        about those troughs (carried around the rooms at door and window head height
                        to conceal lamps completely, lighting the rooms indirectly) but as we
                        switched the light on for the first time there was great excitement and Mrs.
                        Guyatt said, "There, don't ever tell me that Walter Burley isn't a genius!"</p>

                    <p>15 October, 1936, Sydney - Lute Drummond to Walter Burley Griffin - Just a
                        note to tell you that we made a modest beginning to put a sum into the bank
                        for a little theatre in Castlecrag to supplement the Valley Theatre. On
                        Sunday night on this roof Captain Fisk started the ball rolling with slides
                        of India and Burma - quite delightful. And Helen Morton and Mrs. Evers took
                        £2-13-0 by way of the nest-egg. On the 24th Professor Brose is giving us a
                        lecture on Beethoven illustrated (development and form, etc.) by the

                        that little round plan. We won't want to seat more than 200. If we do then
                        you can build that magnificent structure at the Postern Gate, nicht wahr?
                        Can you write me about the block by return mail as it will help the

                        article from the pen of Walter Burley Griffin who has achieved such world
                        wide distinction as an architect, landscape architect and Town Planner; and
                        to whom we, as wild life conservationists, owe so much for his noble vision
                        in setting out the original plans of the Federal Capital City of Australia
                            <note>Canberra</note>, and for his monumental work mentioned in this
                        article. Mr. Griffin and his colleagues are at present setting a great
                        example and object lesson for the whole of Australia in the work of
                        occupational conservation which they are engaged upon in the areas here

                    <p>abroad for overlapping experiments directed toward attaining greater unity in
                        our use and administration of the land. Each successive stage has been
                        missing its mark because of the deficient consciousness of a larger organic
                        element of which it has sooner or later found itself to be but a part.
                        Comprehensive planning will have to learn from Mother Nature the secret of
                        growth and equilibrium, and that conservation which contrasts so strikingly
                        with the devastation, even to desert conditions, that the greatest of man's
                        civilizations have always left in their wake, and which is proceeding at
                        accelerating pace in spite of recent pricks of our consciences, and of all
                        the attempted safeguards possible to our present consciousness.</p>
                    <p>Castlecrag is an effort toward Land Planning in the fundamental sense of
                        arranging for that use to which the terrain is most suitable. Land in this
                        sense is accorded the respect due to a highly developed and perfected living
                        organism not to be exterminated nor treated as dead material, nor as a mere
                        section of the map. That part of the Metropolitan Unity which comprises the
                        natural setting of Sydney has now gone through a metamorphosis throughout
                        its whole extent, from Botany Bay almost to Broken Bay, so complete that
                        without the latter's fortunate survival one would scarcely be able to
                        picture the Sydney of the last century with its then justly famous Harbour.</p>
                    <p>In the eighteen-eighties upper Middle Harbour was chosen in advance of the
                        farther Eastern suburbs, by a far-seeing group, for residential development;
                        and the monumental Suspension Bridge was built to give access. For this,
                        however, the Government so positively denied either tramway facilities or
                        franchise that the bulk of the territory was precluded from occupation until
                        the days of private motor cars. Since 1920 the motive of the suburban
                        development of 750 acres of this land in Castlecrag, Castlecove and Covecrag
                        peninsulas in Middle Harbour within five miles of the City center has been
                        the permanent preservation, through the vigilance of numerous interested
                        owners and appreciative</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 166 ====]</p>
                    <p>rangers, of the pristine loveliness of some five miles of remnant of the rock
                        bound woodland coves.</p>
                    <p>Whatever benefits may accrue from a general overhead Governmental and public
                        interest, no control that is not localized in the strictest sense possible,
                        i.e. personal, has ever yet availed to prevent the disappearance of our wild
                        life before the advancing population. In the present incipient stage of
                        general understanding of nature even the best of our organized communities,
                        authorities and municipalities suffer their reserves to be "improved" or
                        despoliated, gradually obliterating the natural character. It is only
                        necessary to stand on some lookout such as Covecrag to be able to
                        distinguish, from all the rest, primitive spots that are under the care of
                        considerate owners and are not indiscriminately accessible to the public.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the cases of personal protective interests are exceptional; and
                        even for these the hazards of bush fires, vandalism, rubbish dumping and
                        reckless depredation for flowers, plants, firewood, poles, bee-trees,
                        timber, soil, sand and stones are uninsurable. Notwithstanding these
                        difficulties and the unsympathetic obstacles of the public authorities, the
                        restoration to the natural state has already been noticeable in Castlecrag
                        with a resident community of about two dozen families only, and during the
                        period of surveys and construction work of many miles of roads and sewers,
                        as well as playing areas, baths, tennis courts and golf courses besides the
                        quarrying and housing. These operations have not so appreciably silted up
                        the coves as in other sections because of the general contour alignment of
                        the narrow roads, their early sealing and the drainage precautions taken
                        wherever possible. The placing of the roads and the allocation of the home
                        sites thus required complete topographical surveys followed by detailed
                        personal feature-studies in order to determine and to conserve the
                        distinctive formations and flora.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the shores, the predominant heights, the caves and</p>
                    <pb n="167"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 167 ====]</p>
                    <p>sculptural rocks are embraced in a connected system of local reserves which
                        separate and screen the lots at the garden fronts. In the same way the
                        roadside and junction groves and thickets screen and make private their
                        street fronts. Thus in addition to the site individually occupied by a
                        self-selected nature lover, there is a reserve on two sides over which, as a
                        contiguous owner, he has an interest through the local Parks Committee of
                        each neighborhood in which the control of these areas will all ultimately be
                        vested. At present one Committee administers the Castlecrag reserves -
                        collecting the ten shillings per year provided for by covenant from each
                        abutting lot for the expense of upkeep and improvement. Nearly 2,000 native
                        trees and shrubs have been planted by this means. As the Castlecrag plans
                        provided for general segregation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic, these
                        connected reserves will eventually be provided with woodland short-cut paths
                        and steps with lighting in contradistinction to the circuitous driveways as
                        required by the gradients, where the land rises in ledges to 330 feet above
                        the tidewater that washes the shores of these promontories.</p>
                    <p>The common property interest in the adjacent play space, for the children
                        especially, of each neighborhood of homes surrounding such an area, fills a
                        want and restores a <hi rend="ul">corrective in the social life</hi> of a
                        great city which has been a most important factor of the more healthy
                        country communities. The Castlecrag social will arises from the
                        consciousness of a unified plan and purpose and provides persuasion and
                        example that have resulted in a practice of not clearing each property to
                        afford evidence of the personal will or assertiveness that seeks to express
                        itself in artificial gardens, or otherwise irrespective of justification.</p>
                    <p>The acid soil of the Hawksbury sandstone underlying the Middle Harbour has
                        furnished what is undoubtedly the cleanest, most delicate and varied
                        ligneous evergreen perpetually-blossoming flora extant. For these reasons no
                        vegetation could be better to live with, free as it is of rank growth,
                        brambles, burrs, weeds or plants seasonably untidy.</p>

                    <p>Moreover it will persist through drought without watering and recover from
                        abuse without help provided the peculiar nature of the soil is respected and
                        manures with exotic seeds are kept out.</p>
                    <p>Not the least important factor in the conservation of nature is, however, the
                        covenant-controlled housing to prevent obtrusive or obstructive buildings
                        and enclosures. The vernacular practice in this respect is all to the
                        contrary, in forms that are unnecessarily bulky as well as uncouth, in
                        colors that are harsh and hot, and in construction that is intolerant of the
                        proximity of trees or shrubs as with palings <note>wooden fencing?</note>,
                        and through the susceptibility of the roofs to fire, climbers or falling
                        branches and the encouragement afforded by the elevated timber flooring to
                        roots, white ants and vermin. The typical houses so far exhibit
                        indestructible construction of stone and concrete with flat impregnable
                        terrace roofs and natural stone textures which, wherever they are visible at
                        all, merge with the primitive features and leave the land 100% that rock
                        garden which it was created. Walter Burley Griffin</p>

                        have just sent a somewhat detailed account to Molly Nicholls which should be
                        typed and sent on to you. We are in a heavenly spot here and fairies
                        certainly led up to it. A palatial house with stately formal garden, big
                        trees, and not an excessive rent. The avenues in every direction are lined

                    <p>certainly a lovely city and we are now in the suburb of the princes, Sultan
                        Gang meaning the Sultans' district. Interestingly enough, in the original
                        Town Plan of Lucknow, Couper Road where we have been living is where the
                        Architects were allocated. Though we can glimpse the surrounding houses from
                        the street, from the house one sees none of the other buildings. The lawyer
                        who effected our lease lives next door (an Indian) and is going to give us
                        lessons in Hindi. Though we have been studying it a bit when a moment
                        offered we can't say we have made any perceptible progress. Our landlord
                        lives about two doors away. Am so glad Clarmyra does not find teaching too
                        trying. It will be great if she has her mother's genius in that field. This
                        is what Miss Drummond says about Mr. Nicholls:- "Mr. Nicholls is a tower of
                        strength to me and is growing rapidly into Anthroposophy. We often talk over
                        things at the German restaurant in this building. He does things for me,
                        quickly and without any ado." - Marion Mahony Griffin to Georgine Mahony

                    <p>15 Saunders Road, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Molly Nicholls -
                        We are not going from bad to worse but from good to better. Our compound
                        (yard in the Yankee language) is 220 feet by 360 feet with the palace (you
                        should see it by moonlight) set about half way back. One (not we) drives in
                        one gate, through the porte-cochere, and out the other gate. Fine trees and
                        big ones, especially around the border, thickets and hedges, the drive lined
                        with an informal hedge of "Our Lady of the Night" which fills the air with
                        perfume as soon as the sun sets though its flower is but a tiny greenish
                        blossom.</p>
                    <p>The fairies brought us here. We were being tossed about with various
                        alternative suggestions none of them materializing and meanwhile Lucknow
                        filling up with people for the Exposition months. One suggestion to move
                        into a hospital building, empty now, that is to be used as an hostel, so as
                        to be on the spot for convenience in superintending the Show - a bluff,
                        dangling from day to day by not turning on water or electric light; one to
                        live on the University campus also on and off; one a house on which we had
                        advanced a month's rent and then had our check returned as it had already
                        been rented by another agent, etc.</p>

                        them were perfectly lovely and insisted there was no urgency about our
                        getting out. So we set out to hunt something down. We found the boarding
                        houses filled up for the whole winter, but one told us of an empty house

                        were going we saw a young couple drive up in their tonga <note>"two-wheeled
                            covered horse cart" from I.2.37</note> so we went back to see if they
                        might be willing to go 50,50 on the house. They were not the tenants but
                        were searching like ourselves and would be glad to have half a house
                        (credentials exchanged Walt the architect of the Exposition and Mr. Stephens
                        a Government official). So our tongas <note>"covered horse cart[s]" from
                            I.2.37</note> trailed around together till finally a stray man said he
                        knew a house that was available and we were led to a different suburb where
                        all the buildings are palaces in beautiful extensive gardens, the suburb of
                        the Indian nahwabs <note>nawabs?</note> - Sultan Gang.</p>
                    <p>The last tenant, a Rajah, had paid Rs. 250 a month rent but they offered it
                        to us for about half that (The Stevens were at home in the Indian language,
                        Mrs. Stephens an Anglo-Indian) and it divides perfectly into quarters for
                        three families, so we took it and have already had an application for the
                        third apartment but he had too many servants. At present the Stevens are to
                        occupy the East half, their preference, on the ground floor. We shall use
                        the great middle entrance and the center room, almost like a court, in
                        common as a reception room and Walt will use the South-West corner room as
                        his private office. Our intention is to use the spiral tower stairway and
                        the suite on the roof for ourselves subletting the other half of the lower
                        floor. Upstairs is lovely all facing south and opening out to a big roof
                        terrace. We would be living among the treetops and no house visible anywhere
                        except the turrets of Butler Palace, our neighbor across the street (for we
                        are on the corner) a full block away, in its great gardens some two blocks
                        square. It is one of the notable palaces of Lucknow. Our exterior is spick
                        and span as all Lucknow is fast becoming with its annual new coat of
                        whitewash, greenish grey</p>

                    <p>with white trimmings. This whitewashing is done every year in Lucknow.</p>
                    <p>Miss Drummond gave us a vivid picture of the plays but no one has told us who
                        took the role of Merlin. She was thrilled with Mr. Nicholls' architectural
                        effects. What a living thing Miss Drummond has made of the Anthro society -
                        Anthroposophy, that new world conception comparable to that of Copernicus
                        which succeeded that of the Greek conception of a flat world with the sun
                        and stars swinging around it - and how wonderfully everyone is taking his
                        part. Tell her that Walt will write her for this Air Mail the technicalities
                        for getting possession of one or the other locations for the Little Theatre.
                        The wording of the function of those reserves gives the Council no rights of
                        ownership at all. That wording was another of Walt's inspirations for when
                        that plan was laid down he had no idea of the difficulties there would be in
                        establishing proper open spaces for community development. For the location
                        where he had planned the circular building for the kindergarten, which is a
                        reserve, there would probably have to be a permanent right of entrance. The
                        building would be one which would qualify as one appropriate to place there.
                        In the location adjacent to the shops there could be a full title to the
                        property.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Maddocks - it is wonderful to see how Deirdre is showing herself so
                        early as a true Saturnian, as is Eric Nicholls, and how marvelously you are
                        opening up the paths to her:- that delight in conflict - she will dare
                        anything. Of her own nature (and she is opening the eyes of her mother isn't
                        she) she knows that an essential of creation is polarity, conflict if you
                        are not afraid of that word. We were thrilled at her response to the
                        knowledge of the battle between the great Angels of Light and of Darkness,
                        and what a picture of her you painted in our hearts with her joy in the
                        plash, plash by which they were filling the world with color. For four years
                        still to come her education should be that of the senses. Up to seven a
                        child is "Greedy for sense experiences," and after the three senses by which
                        we know ourselves internally (the Life, Movement and Balance senses)</p>

                    <p>the sense of smell is the first in the order of development. It,
                        interestingly enough, is the fighting sense. It rouses man to a knowledge of
                        his battle with the external world. It warns him of danger and awakens his
                        consciousness to the things that he can enjoy without fear. It is the first
                        of the five senses which acquaint us with the manifested world, the Solar
                        system, the world in which the polarities are Life and Death in which world
                        only could the human being be created, a Being with the power of Free Will.
                        Through these five senses which arise from the contact or conflict of the
                        astral with the etheric (smell, taste, seeing, warmth, hearing) the brain
                        mind - the moon mind - is developed. You see how wisely you are laying the
                        foundation of her intellect, her reasoning faculty, which is founded on
                        these five sense perceptions. Afterward if these senses have been well
                        developed including the hearing which is a transition sense giving us a
                        knowledge of the inner nature of things, of their soul, then we can, through
                        the power of our free will, develop in full consciousness other senses - the
                        Imaginational, the Inspirational and the Intuitional senses - by which we
                        can perceive things in the supersensible world.</p>

                    <p>It may be a mere truism that India is at a turning point but if we take
                        architecture, as I do, to be the clearest index of the undercurrents of
                        human consciousness, past or present, we can discern two portents.</p>
                    <p>1. A loss of feeling for design and a slovenliness in construction in the
                        vast bulk of the current work.</p>
                    <p>2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the
                        cultured thinkers who are in the minority.</p>
                    <p>These must be vigorously combated not merely for the welfare of India but for
                        the sake of the regeneration of the outside world whose main ambitions are
                        wealth and power. For architecture, according even</p>
                    <pb n="174"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 174 ====]</p>
                    <p>to Herbert Spencer, is essentially a religious production or, as in the
                        profound statement of Dr. <note>James H.?</note> Cousins, omitting his
                        particular qualifications, "all art is the extroversion of what in religion
                        is introversion." Here in India materialistic modernism would be unnatural
                        and the occasional intrusion of it even into the architecture of the
                        industrial centers are hardly happy.</p>
                    <p>As things are, the forces that gave rise to architecture in India are no
                        longer expressed therein, since it has long been static, and the meticulous
                        rules that superseded them for ages are breaking down as natural science
                        subtly undermines religious authority, notwithstanding that the process has
                        been retarded longest here in the East. The hereditary artistic crafts,
                        which have kept the oriental more attractive than the occidental scene, are
                        already becoming dependent upon governmental or other artificial agencies
                        for their stimulus and cannot be expected to remain affective much longer.
                        In the case of buildings and groups simple principles, such as symmetry with
                        axis defined, retain here an authoritative standing which one does not
                        observe so generally elsewhere. But even so the general run of construction
                        in the towns is evidently the worst that has ever afflicted them. There has,
                        indeed, been only the repetition of Saracenic, European and the occasionally
                        attempted adaptation and revival of historic Hindu forms to contrast with
                        the vast mass of buildings wherein the disdain for "ideal" has eliminated
                        the practical architect's craft so that in practice the lion's share of
                        building is carried on wholly through engineers and the mistris
                            <note>foremen, overseers</note> who are legion. Against both these
                        currents is set the course for a renaissance which depends upon the
                        individualized fresh longings and imagination of the people in whom the
                        impulse has for a long time been dormant.</p>
                    <p>No longer is there a sound case for national or communal styles. For the
                        spirit of the times rather than of the localities finds consciousness in
                        these days of world-wide contacts, notwithstanding that the stamp of the
                        place is an essential element of each architectural</p>
                    <pb n="175"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 175 ====]</p>
                    <p>problem, and any building, except the most vast, that is unsympathetic with
                        its natural, human-natural, and artificial environment is neutralized and
                        vitiated thereby. No one need expect a personal inventiveness of individuals
                        to solve the problems of aesthetics which the academies of traditional art
                        have failed to work out on a basis of precedence and laws, science and
                        "orders," for hundreds of years. Yet individuals, in the absence of guilds
                        and castes, will have to evoke the forms for future buildings in the same
                        imaginative way as the earlier folk through their periods of historic
                        architectural creation, in China, India, Persia, Egypt, Greece or France, or
                        as, in the nineteenth century, devoted composers brought our greatest epoch
                        in music.</p>
                    <p>This century while still young was shown the way by architectural forerunners
                        at the end of the last century among whom Louis H. Sullivan was the first.
                        But amongst the confusion and visual discord following upon a century of
                        intensive industrialism the way has not been smooth nor has much progress
                        been made though interest in the architect's work is growing all over the
                        world and mere reproduction of forms has lost its news value, so to speak,
                        in favor of something fresh.</p>
                    <p>For forty years in America, Europe and Australia, the writer looked in vain
                        for crockery table-ware that could be accommodated in any decorative scheme
                        that embraced colors. But India appears to have the facilities to develop
                        such products with the addition of chemical technology to village potteries,
                        and of producing decorative values at a cost competitive with the ephemeral
                        Japanese mass-production, which is confined to minor pieces only. It is not
                        necessary that the status of the handicrafts should be as humble as most
                        people imagine it to be. So far as artistic products are concerned, Mr.
                        Gandhi's instincts are sound in pinning to the villages his faith for a
                        fruitful future in India. Increased attention to them might result in a
                        world-wide demand for the useful and attractive articles which they can
                        produce at a price to compete with the factories. Such a demand would permit
                        of the adoption of better</p>
                    <pb n="176"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 176 ====]</p>
                    <p>technical methods, and increased earnings would follow in their turn.</p>
                    <p>With emphasis on the advantages that are unique to handicraft the competition
                        of the factories can be reduced to a borderland of the less clearly
                        selective fields of operation. It is not difficult to realize how each
                        village or district could be brought to take pride in some distinctive
                        output and how better organization and co-operation could be effected on the
                        basis of a <hi rend="ul">world-wide economy</hi>, not on just that of a
                        local supply and demand. The results that can be achieved by a little more
                        individual self-reliance, which educative methods of training could bring
                        out in the craftsman, are evidenced by the astonishing response of the
                        indigenous painting art to the new stress on individuality, as shown in the
                        Art Gallery of the Lucknow Exposition. It is notable, too, that in the local
                        market certain printed cotton pieces of greater merit than the general run
                        bring a 100 per cent advance in price. It is of no slight moment to artistic
                        salvation that fabric designs can be carried out to order without undue
                        delay or cost. Abroad this possibility has been for many years, and may
                        still be, limited to carpets from Austria or, with limitations, from China.
                        Here are gaps wide open for artistic craftsmen and a chance for distinctive
                        interiors consistent with the character of each owner and his comprehensive
                        scheme of architecture and decoration.</p>
                    <p>Much is being said now and, especially in America, done in educating human
                        feelings toward a standard of effectiveness and control comparable with that
                        of our intellects and physiques as developed through modern training. And
                        far-reaching consequences to the art of living and especially of living
                        together form the outlet into some form of creative effort of otherwise
                        futile, or, at their worst, wasteful and destructive emotions. Where
                        habitual criminals of the deepest dye have been reformed at San Quentin,
                        California, through the simple expedient of a year of choral singing in the
                        penitentiary, there is fair prospect for remedial measures with the larger

                        concepts of the facts of nature. But imaginative moods can be and are,
                        though still too rarely, utilized for the material activities of artistic

                        to personal welfare it does offer a new vantage point for artistic endeavour

                        constantly putting new processes and materials at our disposal. There will
                        be no glutted markets and consequent depressions when its services become a

                        mathematically restricted physical and intellectual permutations and
                        combinations. Appreciative critics of the jewel-like beauty of the Taj Mahal
                        can see how the most beautiful buildings can still be improved in many
                        different ways under the play of fancies as free as that of the designer in
                        his time. The Creator of the 1,500 crores <note>ten millions

                        external nature. The virtues of the greatest quality of India,
                        individualism, have been less emphasized than its defects, perhaps, but it

                        destruction of the earth commenced. Before this stage there could be no

                        in the pyramids with prophetic square base. Before this stage there could be
                        no meaning in duplicity or polarity because these were otherwise without
                        purpose or end. This is the sentient or "feeling" soul at work. Thus, as in

                        extended. And how significant still are those pairs of minarets where the
                        roots of dualism are deepest. All over Asia states, triplicity still remains
                        the aim and acme of architectural perfection.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks, however, with their own intellectual mastery of the "feelings"
                        brought perfection to all the arts, made art the servant and educator of the
                        whole life, and their architecture idealized the Quadruple form. Evidence of
                        intellect, appearing with Abraham first, functions wholly with Aristotle in
                        this great age when, only, has it become the common prerogative of men. Man
                        working with the feelings joined with the thinking not only evolved all the
                        great arts in this period but organized the great religions that have been
                        spread wide over the world by enthusiastic missionaries, Confucianism,
                        Buddhism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. The Individual ego came into its own
                        when the Godhead Himself brought Divinity to the earthly human being.</p>
                    <p>The simple cube or parallelepipedon would be the architectural evidence of
                        man's identification of himself with the solid earth - North, South, East
                        and West, already given idealized expression in Greek architecture but
                        really only admitted as an end in itself in a later age by the ultra moderns
                        of today. The inspired prophets of the succeeding age, quite naturally, came
                        only as a reaction at the close of such a period, to formulate a sign
                        prophesying the succession. The hip or gable growing out of the walls and
                        the cross crocketed pinnacles of churches are five sided and five angled
                        respectively, and they still dominate these most resplendent architectural

                    <p>Five - Quintuplicity - This age has commenced only with the 15th century A.D.
                        It first gained expression in Europe where individual freedom had become
                        widespread under conditions of Christian moral teachings and the
                        consciousness that, even during the struggle of each against all, there was
                        an instrument of the Sun Deity on earth for the help of each one. In ancient
                        times five was instinctively comprehended as an evil omen, but is so only in
                        the sense of free choice between the compressive forces of natural law and
                        mechanization, easily yielded to, on the one hand and centrifugal forces of
                        individual initiative gradually to develop man out of dependence on or
                        interference with other beings.</p>
                    <p>So far as I know the only attempt to give architectural form to this
                        consciousness is the present portentous "Goetheanum," center of the General
                        Anthroposophic Society, the work of its founder, Rudolf Steiner, Ph.D. on
                        sundry studies of whose publications these observations on the relationship
                        between the different stages of religious consciousness and architecture are
                        based. This threatening scull-like <note>skull-like?</note> structure in
                        Switzerland puts the stern and forbidding aspect of the work of this age
                        before the society's European students and workers which the present seems
                        to justify. However it is just as possible to beings of intellectual
                        aspirations to accept the necessities of materialization without accepting
                        the ugliness it reveals when man succumbs to materialism's thankless
                        rigidity as a taskmaster. Meaning and interest given to this solid state of
                        incarnation can transform it in life and in architecture into the servant of
                        new beauty instead of a one-eyed tyrant.</p>
                    <p>Such an alternative depends, however, upon the comprehension of reincarnation

                    <p>SCIENTIFIC APPROACH</p>
                    <p>The coming scientific approach to architecture is less concerned with the
                        auspices of the moon's phases or the "aspect" of planets than with the
                        aspects of the Sun, that medicinal heating and lighting agency whose service
                        is of so vast importance. It takes note of such unusual phenomena as
                        earthquakes and requires a knowledge of the character and direction of the
                        prevailing winds each month of the year. It subordinates even dimensions of
                        rooms to the matter of repetitional modules for the arrangement and
                        organization of the building horizontally and vertically, in an inclusive
                        unit; and the standardization of all the parts therein and the
                        simplification of construction. It utilizes the local facilities of the
                        market for economically solving the problems of effective structure and
                        protective covering.</p>
                    <p>But this sort of approach does not overlook those factors of internal
                        planning that contribute to orderliness, spaciousness and impressiveness, as
                        well as to convenience and comfort. Nor does it ignore the character and
                        value of the environment with which the building must not clash if it is not
                        to lose its permanent value. In many commercial buildings the greatest value
                        may be that of publicity; in domestic housing the evidence of culture. In
                        the long run, buildings cannot be arbitrarily dissected and culled from the
                        surroundings but must stand or fall with them. No great proportion of
                        buildings at present start from these simplest fundamentals of practice.
                        When they do, much of the present customs and habits will be sloughed off.
                        The seasons must be considered and the orientation as well as the type of
                        construction appropriate to the climate, the fenestration, and in India,
                        worshippers of the moon, the fear of the Sun must be eliminated.</p>

                    <p>FOR THE HOT SEASON</p>
                    <p>In Lucknow, except in the case of preponderant need for working light from
                        the North, preference might well be given to a north and south major
                        alignment to minimize the southern aspect of the building, and consideration
                        of the desirable and undesirable aspects for the winds for cooling and
                        ventilation or for bearing disagreeable storms, corroborates this
                        assumption. For the hot season the easterly breezes will be conserved for
                        the east side and for the cold weather the same side will be sheltered from
                        the westerly winds, whilst during the monsoon the through currents will most
                        effectively afford necessary ventilation.</p>
                    <p>Verandhas <note>i.e., verandas</note> as projecting ample out-of-door rooms
                        have many advantages in themselves as compared with galleries and they do
                        permit the light of heaven to reach the rooms. Where this light at times
                        carries the radiant heat of the sun, the adjustable Venetian blind, outside
                        the glass, always affords the means of averting this heat without losing the
                        light or ventilation. Likewise it affords positive rain protection in the
                        extreme as compared with gallery protection for windows and it has the
                        advantage of adaptability to all the seasons. Khustatis are rather a
                        disagreeable expedient for they require incessant attention and shut off the
                        light and withhold much of the draft. An alternative proposal for the
                        Lucknow University Library is a modern gauze curtain, Rui Tati, rolled along
                        water pipes perforated to give an adjustable drip on the windward side when
                        the curtain is rolled down and a valve opened. This is a special case where
                        the greatest difficulty will be in the hot dry season and where the bands of
                        the roof windows offer a ready receptacle.</p>
                    <p>As an expedient for weather protection the chagga seems to me to have been
                        the least satisfactory as well as the most common feature of Indian
                        buildings. It is not only flimsy, as old monuments attest, but it looks
                        flimsy, and a parting of the ways between the wholly logical architecture
                        and that which accepts beauty as a mere semblance of ideal</p>

                        ledges, deep reveals, label hoods and other constructions meet the same

                    <p>The bulk of the remaining heat evil can be removed by structural insulation
                        for which fibrous magnesium oxychloride composition affords most effective,
                        and at the same time permanent, insulation, an advantage which the more
                        expensive cork surpasses only by 10 per cent. As India is a source of all
                        the ingredients for such composition for the world outside, these
                        insulations may well become a field for mass production. Incorporated in
                        cellular roof slab construction, it is doubtful if the extra cost would be
                        an appreciable factor in the cost of the house. It may be possible
                        ultimately to come to insulated houses entirely of this material in a
                        tessellated form of masonry such as the writer has been employing for 20
                        years in Australia where Portland cement is the sufficiently protective
                        building material. The mass of structural material is thereby reduced to a
                        trifling fraction of the accepted type of masonry construction so that the
                        volume of the materials amounted to one fifth of the entire bulk of the
                        houses themselves and the two simple structural units lend themselves to an
                        infinitude of combination for architectural effect. The walls, assembled
                        rather than laid, had the advantage of producing precision, and the
                        sincerity of their cut-stone-like structural finish, which needed no film
                        nor plastic coating inside or out, gave them a solidity and permanence not
                        obtainable with bricks and mortar or plaster.</p>
                    <p>The flat roof is the greatest advantage in subordinating buildings to their
                        natural surroundings and in harmonizing the relations in groups and masses.
                        It is doubtful whether the lime terracing for certain terracing protection
                        will be necessary hereafter in all cases since proper reinforcement
                        counteracts the stresses which cause flat roofs to leak and avoidance of
                        such leaks has been obtained in current houses at</p>

                    <p>Castlecrag, New South Wales carried out by the writer. The possibility of
                        interior spaciousness attained by loosely separated compartments and varying
                        heights are indicated in the illustrations. The vital question of ceiling
                        heights about which there has been so much misapprehension, even in
                        Australia, is gradually becoming answered there in favor of heights almost
                        as low as in England, though the municipal and state enactments stood long
                        in the way. The alternatives, besides offering effectiveness, will
                        ultimately prove less costly than building rooms to inordinate heights.</p>
                    <p>Improved methods and materials are what each modern architect needs and not
                        the determination of his course by rules of structural economy or schedules
                        of prices but by giving him greater freedom to work out practically fresh
                        forms of design, unfettered as far as possible, in order to bring about in
                        substance the forms that are his heritage in imagination.</p>
                    <p>THE FINAL TEST</p>
                    <p>The horizontal architecture typical of the early Hindu south, and the
                        vertical architecture of the north and the Saracens are both relatively
                        under-developed as architecture and afford innumerable points of departure
                        for a modern expression not inconsistent with the historic past but giving
                        it new interest.</p>
                    <p>The effective ledge roof lighting that admits a brilliant glow without heat
                        or light is an inheritance from South India that will assist in giving to
                        the Reading Room of the Library of Lucknow University the desired
                        distribution of the sun.</p>
                    <p>The final test of modernism is the replacement of industrial eye-sores with
                        public amenities. During the seven years of depression, whilst industrial
                        growth had stopped, the writer fortunately found a field in which the
                        architect could help allay the suspicious fears and political animosities
                        sufficiently to enable a dozen municipal authorities to determine upon sites
                        within their own boundaries for replacing dumps</p>

                    <p>17 November, 1936 - Castlecrag, New South Wales, Australia - Ula Maddocks to
                        Marion Mahony Griffin - This morning there was a meeting to discuss
                        kindergarten for the children, objections to a regular kindergarten teacher
                        - too formal; to joining one near by - too many children and don't like
                        Willoughby environment after Castlecrag; the mothers to divide the days
                        among themselves - too haphazard, no continuity of place or person in
                        charge. We talked for an hour and then Mrs. Trinick, in my absence from the
                        room, suggested that I take it on they paying me enough to free me a bit
                        from household chores. So that is on for trial. I do hope you approve. Edgar
                        was somewhat staggered when I met him at the gate with the news. But it's
                        really not much more than we have already, for Deirdre usually collects for
                        the day four or five children before breakfast and as I tuck her in at night
                        she gets quite pathetic and says, "I've got no children to play with." A
                        fire broke out in Castlecrag last week. It was put out but we had to watch
                        it for two days to prevent fresh outbreaks from smoldering logs, etc.
                        Nicholls and Deans are fine chaps. At first our hearts sank into our boots
                        but I think now most of it will be recovered before you get back. With love
                        from your children and Ula Maddocks</p>
                    <p>18 November, 1936 - Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin -
                        Today's mail seems to be due to reach you nearest to your birthday
                        anniversary so please accept our affectionate greetings and felicitations
                        and wishes for many happy returns of the day. On the 24th we will plant a
                        frangipani tree in your garden and drink your health in orange juice at
                        dawn. Deirdre, ever anxious for a celebration, will doubtless greet the news
                        that - "Today is Mr. Griffin's birthday" with "Shall we have a party?" We'd
                        like to include a wish for a speedy return but then, after all, it's your
                        birthday and it's for you that we should be invoking the Gods,</p>

                    <p>not for ourselves. So we will leave it to them, already well satisfied that
                        they have landed us all on the earth at the same time. (Nothing less than
                        the earth is your home. It is not the case of the "homeless wanderer" for
                        you are everywhere at home.) Really the gods are such capable managers of
                        human affairs that it is sad that they should be resigning in our favor,
                        leaving us to run our own shows consciously. We're pretty sure to make a
                        grand muddle of it before we attain the graceful inevitability of - even a
                        calliopsis in bloom. Here is one petal and so again birthday greetings. Ula

                    <p>24 November - 1936 - Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin -
                        Your birthday - a most auspicious day. Now you both are celebrating by going
                        to a cinema am I right? Yesterday began the new kindergarten nursery group
                        here. A particularly happy and successful beginning it was too. Nine
                        children were brought by their parents punctually at 9:30 all freshly washed
                        and brushed and each with a packet of play lunch. I had a fine collection of
                        new toys and each child as he came in immediately pounced on one or the
                        other of these and the parents' last minute instructions to "be good and
                        remember to wipe your nose" were lost in a rising babel of hammering and
                        shunting and bouncing intermingled with squeals as to who got what first.
                        They are a particularly fine lot of children and I am enjoying them
                        immensely.</p>

                        wheel-barrows, scooters, etc., things that call into play the big muscles,
                        while the older ones work inside at tables. Then we sit around cross-legged
                        in a circle and eat play lunch all together and with considerable ceremony.

                        following two or three banked up on top of her and there was a wild scramble
                        of legs and arms. Deirdre left her</p>

                        round and the tragic truth had to be faced, Kaaren gathered up the limp
                        cicada and with flashing eyes and firm step she marched off with "I will
                        take it home and put new life in it." Deirdre and Kaaren are the best of
                        friends but temperamentally they are poles apart. Deirdre tumbles about the
                        lawn doing all kinds of physical contortions in sheer sensuous enjoyment and
                        chuckling with laughter. Kaaren joins saying, "Oh yes Deirdre, we must be
                        having some fun on the lawn." Then seeing me watching them she says to me -
                        "This is the time when we must be doing our exercises" as though to dispel
                        any idea of her indulging in any emotional abandon. I wanted to tell you of
                        Graham a melancholic, surely, 'born to trouble as the stars fly upward,'

                        New Zealand examining the diploma students at the Conservatorium. He decided
                        on a block not far from Mr. Junge's place on the Battlement and is to call
                        in at the office and sign the contract before Thursday when he returns to
                        New Zealand. A particularly nice man. I introduced him to Miss Drummond as
                        she was rehearsing the play at the valley Theatre. They had studied music in

                        the King's marrying an American ask Father Griffin. We talked over the
                        possibility several years ago when he and Mother Griffin were with us in
                        Melbourne at dinner at the Lippincotts - the easiest way for Britain to get
                        the U.S. back into the "empire." It made him so mad he couldn't eat his
                        desert. However I don't think this marriage has been made according to the
                        plan laid down. Theodore Roosevelt's daughter was the one under discussion.
                        Only the Gods removed that threat when he was the Wilson opponent.

                    <p>24 November 1936 - Castlecrag - Eric M. Nicholls to Walter Burley Griffin</p>
                    <p>LAND SALES - Gates has just bought a block on the East side of his present
                        holding on Covecrag.</p>
                    <p>A Mr. Moriarty is going to buy the lot No. 6 next to Pollard's on the Haven.
                        It happened this way. Saturday I was lunching at the Deans' when two chaps
                        knocked at the door, having been sent there by the Castlecrag grocer in
                        whose shop they were having a drink as a refresher after spending the
                        morning walking the foreshores from suspension bridge to us, a continuation
                        of their intermittent search for a waterfront lot. One of the two remembered
                        me as a fellow student at the Victoria Art Gallery some 20 years ago. The
                        brother had met Edgar Deans' brother so no introductions were needed. I
                        remembered well a shy lad commencing art to whom I magnanimously gave
                        Ruskin's "Elements of Drawing," and this same chap had always harbored an
                        appreciative spot for me as a consequence. Now a commercial artist he has
                        his own business here and owns a launch, and one look at the above lot and I
                        could see that he was satisfied. We went the rounds but came back to this
                        lot. The next Saturday the deposit was paid and they are going to begin
                        forthwith to build a house. He already had a flat roofed house in mind and
                        wanted a native garden so all is simple so far. Both he and his sister are
                        interested in Anthroposophy and have considerable knowledge of the
                        Aboriginals and their occult knowledge, so are fair prospects for
                        Anthroposophy. He had quite a chat at my house on Sunday when Miss Drummond
                        and the others popped in on their return from the Nativity play rehearsal
                        down at the theatre.</p>
                    <p>And of course under land sales should come that of the Greater Sydney

                        hand rail, etc. His house is superlatively finished and furnished and is a
                        delight to them and to all visitors. Ramsay and his wife were among the many
                        I showed over and were delighted. He has seen through many expensive houses
                        but none where the proprietor has got so much real value for his money.
                        Eric's garden is all in an advanced state and the sunken garden which
                        continues the long axis of the house is stocked with some couple of hundred
                        different varieties of most suitable small plants, many of which are
                        blossoming lustily. F.G. Pratten has no doubt that Eric has the best house
                        on the North Shore. I'll soon be forwarding photographs.</p>

                    <p>Don't comment in your letters on Mrs. Maddocks' studying Steiner's
                        "Education" with us for as Molly was telling me Mrs. Guyatt has strong
                        feelings against anything spiritual and especially children's belief in
                        fairy stories, thinks it does them harm. David, however, much to her disgust
                        still talks about God and "waves his arms around just like Mrs. Griffin." He
                        was over at the house one day and there were a few drops of rain and he said
                        "That's God's rain isn't it?" So Molly sang him a simple little thing -
                        "Through the air everywhere God is sending rain, Pitter, patter, pitter,
                        patter down the window pane." We are all saying "Thank God for the rain."

                        <hi rend="ul">TRANSFORMATION OF MATTER INTO SPIRIT</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Spirit is that which creates. All efficiency derives from free spirit. Man is
                        spirit. His capacity to do, to conceive, to create has no limits. Putting
                        spirit in bondage brings illness and death to his body and soul. The
                        inspired slogan of the French Revolution was Liberty, Equity, Fraternity.
                        The 18th century established in the United States a political organization,
                        based on the control by the majority, to establish and maintain <hi
                            rend="ul">EQUITY</hi>. By what means can we attain Liberty in addition
                        to Equity? Obviously by establishing a social organization whose function</p>
                    <pb n="192b"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 192b ====]</p>
                    <p>is to maintain <hi rend="ul">Liberty</hi>. Such an organization would have to
                        include all the citizenry as the Equity organization does. But could it
                        function through the decisions of a majority? Obviously not, but only
                        through an instrument which makes it possible for each individual to
                        determine and use his own abilities in his own way. This organ, to attain
                        its end, must be able to place the means, for ability to function, in this
                        realm and not in the political realm whose natural interest is not in
                        ability but in equity. Men cannot be equal in their abilities - no two men's
                        abilities are alike. So the nature of this organization will be the polar
                        opposite of that of the Political organ. It cannot function by means of a
                        majority vote. So to attain democracy we must free our Political organ from
                        the task of concerning itself with questions of Liberty, watching out only
                        for equity (like the traffic officer). Land rentals which belong to the
                        community (if we can say land "belongs" to humans in any true sense) as a
                        whole could well meet the needs of this organization. Imagination and
                        inspiration can flourish and become effective only through an <hi rend="ul"
                            >Abilities Organ</hi> which would assure its free play and see to it
                        that every individual has full opportunity to develop his abilities
                        throughout his life.</p>
                    <p>If one undertakes to break down all boundaries one is still on the downward
                        path if he tackles them by material forces. It is a misinterpretation of
                        that inner urge if violence is used as we see it being used in Europe at
                        present where the necessity for a United States of Europe is very great - a
                        Federation with a unified <hi rend="ul">Economic Organization</hi> which
                        should become a <hi rend="ul">World Economic Organization</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Our task is to transform matter into spirit, not too great a task since the
                        coming of the Christ effected the turn in the Cosmos completing the
                        evolution of spirit into matter which was necessary to make <hi rend="ul"
                            >Free Will</hi> possible.</p>
                    <p>I had not been in Australia long before the burden of my song became - "You
                        will find your problems solved when you have transformed the British Empire
                        into a Federation. You can't expect England to do that. It is</p>
                    <pb n="193"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 193 ====]</p>
                    <p>the task of the Dominions." I once listened to a lecture of Mr. Laski
                            <note>Harold J. Laski?</note>, a self-confident young Britisher, in
                        Yale. When questions were being put by the audience, I asked if it would not
                        be a great step toward solving world problems he was discussing if the form
                        of the British Empire were so altered. He said that you could never bring
                        that about, and then seeing the Irish in my face he flung back - "Ireland
                        would never stand for that." But interestingly enough within these last few
                        years Ireland has done that very thing and has accomplished the step in that
                        direction for the Empire. It would be no more difficult for each of the
                        others to do the same.</p>
                    <p>Because of the threat of Ireland's being used as a take-off for an attack on
                        England, de Valera was able to establish the complete freeing of Irish
                        affairs from interference from England; and Ireland accepts no titles (the
                        cheapest form of bribery). Then later, after a new king was crowned, Ireland
                        of her own free will as an act of Parliament accepted this king as the king
                        of Ireland to function so in matters that were of common concern to all the
                        British units. So there already exists a federation of Britain and Eire and
                        it has so functioned during the present war though much misunderstood by the
                        general public. Ireland is now in a position to attain what she first
                        desired - a congressional form of government.</p>
                    <p>A woman in the audience said to her friend whom I met after the lecture -
                        "That woman has the sweetest face I ever saw." That, like Ireland's
                        achievement, was the transformation of matter by spirit for as a draftsman
                        in the first office I worked in, a very good friend of mine, once in an
                        earnest discussion said to me that I was like his wife - I knew I was a very
                        plain looking woman. You see my spirit has since transformed matter.</p>
                    <p>India is working to the same end as Ireland. With this federation
                        accomplished the menace of Britain would be gone - the British federation
                        could carry out its natural function of breaking down boundaries and Germany
                        and the rest of the world would no longer need to resort to violence in
                        joining that world movement - a World Economic Organization.</p>

                    <p>4 January, 1937 - 15 Saunders Road - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula
                        Maddocks - Walt says if I'm to get in on those January sales I'd better
                        reply to your letter immediately so it's on his head if more curses fall on
                        him for lack of finished drawings. There's one thing I would like to have
                        though I've got my nerve to suggest it but if you will put temptation before
                        me, a pyjama gown cut on the pattern of Mrs. Nicholls' red one. When
                        mosquito season is on the only costume that makes life endurable is the
                        pyjama with long wide legs and wide flowing sleeves and light colored ones
                        are no good here. That red smock you sent me is perfect. Those we bought,
                        the linen colored ones, are dirtier in two hours than they would be in two
                        months in Castlecrag. My goodness, you folks should appreciate dustless
                        Castlecrag. Within three days of the Monsoon, everything is covered with a
                        fine red or black dust which at this season one doesn't notice in the
                        atmosphere but you couldn't drop a handkerchief and use it after picking it
                        up. It would be spotted with patches of stain which won't shake off,
                        wherever it touched anything. So gaudy rich colors are the thing. They call
                        the Indians dirty but it takes more than any ordinary washing to get these
                        stains out and no wonder the poorer one's clothes usually look very rusty.
                        One day I watched with interest (as I was sitting in a car waiting for Walt
                        to come out of the Exposition office) an Indian come to a well a hundred or
                        so feet away, dip his pail and take a full bath with the utmost modesty and
                        greater cleverness than any movie film actor, never exposing his body at
                        all, screened always by his sari like scarf over which he finally threw a
                        clean one dropping the one he had been wearing to the ground and then
                        proceeding to wash it. It was very interesting. The fact that it was right
                        out in a public highway didn't concern him at all. Naturally the clothes he
                        was wearing got well soaked as he poured a pailful of water down his back.</p>
                    <p>10 February <note>1937</note> - Well there goes the chance of getting in on
                        January sales but there really was no urgent need. The letter to Nicholls

                    <p>of the mischief Walt has been in. The day before he had to go to Cawnpore for
                        a miserable committee meeting of the Exposition for finalizing the accounts
                        of the contractor, all perfectly useless as it was all hanky-panky. The
                        meeting was closed just five minutes after a train had left so he had three
                        hours on his hands which he spent walking. Perhaps this was the last straw
                        which ruptured the walls of the gall bladder so we can lay that up against
                        the miserable Exposition coterie though that doesn't wash with
                        Anthroposophists who know that nothing happens by chance but all in
                        accordance with one's own decisions so one can really feel no bitterness
                        about anything that happens. It is really amazing to be able to see things
                        that way. However one is tempted to quote a favorite saying of Roy
                        Lippincott's "I wish them no harm but I hope they choke."</p>
                    <p>By the way Genevieve <note>Lippincott</note>, it isn't for the lack of
                        thinking of you we haven't written to thank you for the beautiful photos of
                        you and Alstan. We received your postal re Arjuna <note>Ronald Craig's
                            daughter</note> last week, Mrs. Maddocks. Steiner says that one of the
                        most important things at present is for Europeans and Indians to learn to
                        understand each other. In carrying out the plan you suggest we both think
                        you would certainly be doing your bit in that great work.</p>
                    <p>Genie <note>Georgine Mahony Smith</note> dear - I'm glad Carl has established
                        a group in Rogers Park <note>a Chicago neighborhood</note>. You should go
                        along too. For years Walt always went to sleep at the readings. Mrs.
                        Williams wouldn't let anybody make fun of him and said he learned more while
                        asleep than most of the ones who kept awake. And there is almost no one who
                        can remember and quote anything that has been read during the evening. The
                        matter really doesn't belong in the memory realm but it gradually soaks in
                        and becomes a part of yourself. Mrs. Cummings should go too. I got a lovely
                        letter from her and am delighted at the possibility of her coming to India.
                        Mrs. Prescott, tell your husband to be sure to go to see some of the
                        Eurythmy performances given in London. I have a notion he would think it a
                        lovely field for Margaret to work in. Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks</p>

                    <p>With the Exposition off the boards our youthful force was back at their
                        school work and we concentrated on the work of our private clients. From the
                        domestic point of view we were revolutionaries as except for the Child of
                        Heaven Harijan, who disposed of our sewage, and the gardener who was part of
                        the estate, the Mrs. did her own house work. With breakfast over, a four
                        story double boiler was filled with the next meal and taken into the
                        drafting room where it could be stoked with coke when needed.</p>
                    <p>The four of us - Walter Burley Griffin, Mr. Halder (Hindu) draftsman and Mr.
                        Mohsin (Mohammedan) superintendent, and Marion Mahony Griffin with an
                        occasional experiment in a draftsman, drove out the private work which was
                        coming in from all sides even to that last day of his life when a Raja
                        appeared who had just acquired 10,000 acres at the foot of the Himalayas and
                        who wanted him to develop it. It was a happy and busy office and we learned
                        how completely false is the usual American conception of India. Oh! they'll
                        outwit you if they can in the matter of paying their bills but that's a part
                        of their clever way of getting rid of Britishers, in addition to having
                        almost completely manned the bureaucracy with Indians when they found how
                        easy it is to bribe officials. Only by pulling off this last war in which
                        Chamberlain was an implement were the consequences of that postponed. There
                        was complete friendliness between the members of the two great religions. It
                        was only the kings who played the game with the British Imperialists. Until
                        we realized the difference in dress nothing in their relationships was
                        evident to reveal any distinction in the young students' feelings toward
                        each other, and they called me their "little mother," I suspect because I
                        scolded them. Now Halder and Mohsin eat their lunches together on the
                        doorsteps of the "kitchen" we never used - a building separate from the
                        house, they were like bosom pals.</p>

                        judge in Lucknow, soon in working drawing stage; dwellings for several
                        University professors; the building for the Paper Mills in Lucknow; a palace
                        for the Prince of Nepal at Bholanpur, and so on. And now the working
                        drawings for the Pioneer Press were drawing toward completion.</p>
                    <p>Then the blow fell and I had to make the decisions. If Eric Nicholls had been
                        inclined to join me we would have carried on but when he decided not to come
                        over I realized that it was probably for the best since he did not have a
                        University degree and that was the first question asked by those whom I
                        talked with concerning his coming over. One Architectural firm offered me a
                        partnership and the Technical school wanted me as a teacher. But nobody
                        could really have stepped into Mr. Griffin's boots so I did what I could to
                        meet the urgent needs of the clients and prepared to return to Sydney.</p>

                    <p>The Lucknow Post office occupies a half block, this Canopy for Mr. Chowdray
                            <note>Chowdry?, Chowdhury?</note> statue of King George <note>George
                        V</note> is to be placed in the park of the other half of the block. The
                        stepped indirect light standards cut diagonally across the square of the
                        canopy with flower boxes at their bases giving mystery and color to the
                        whole. The upper half of the pyramid forms the protecting roof for the
                        statue which is heroic in dimensions. The statue itself is a fine piece of
                        work and is illuminated by indirect lighting from the molded shelves from
                        which the interior vaults spring. Broad flights of stairs lead to the
                        entrances on the four sides. It is a very radical, a truly revolutionary
                        design.</p>
                    <p>The drawings of the canopy were only just finished when Mr. Griffin died. Mr.
                        Chowdray <note>Chowdry?, Chowdhury?</note> asked me to go with him to get
                        the approval of the design by the chairman in charge. So we planned together
                        what we should say. We took it to his office. Mr. Chowdray said:- "We have
                        come to present the sketch design for acceptance." There was a statue of
                        Queen</p>

                        George's monument called for a masculine touch, " - and The Chairman said:-
                        "I accept it." Mr. Chowdray and I looked at each other. There was evidently
                        nothing more to be said. So to break the silence Mr. Chowdray asked if he
                        would like to have a model made and he said "Yes." So that was that.</p>
                    <p>17 February, 1937 - Sultangung <note>Sultan Gung?</note>, Lucknow - Marion
                        Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - I'm afraid my last letter sounded rather
                        flippant what with the "Hope they choke" etc. coming just after you had
                        received the cable, but it was written on that fourth day when everything
                        seemed to be going so well. Saturday after the operation I sat by Walt's bed
                        through the night. What a pity you couldn't have been here to help nurse
                        him. He waked at about five quietly with no sign of pain. At about seven I
                        started home. I expected to pick up a tonga <note>"covered horse cart" from
                            I.2.37</note> along the way but at that time in the morning there were
                        none so I walked the five miles home. It was a pleasant walk in the early
                        morning quite a bit of it along the river bank, and I didn't mind it a bit.
                        A few days before, Walter had taken pencil sketches of the Mahmudabad
                        Library over to show the Rajah who was delighted with the scheme. He
                        promised a rendered perspective for the Monday morning following. So on my
                        arrival home I put in a long day on that and then had a good night's sleep,
                        was up early Monday morning and worked on the drawing (the men in the office
                        had gone over to see Walt Sunday afternoon) till one o'clock and was just
                        putting on the last wash when they came - two men and the Rajah. It was the
                        first time I had seen them though he had invited me to come over with Walt
                        but I had put my time on the drawing instead. He is a very charming young
                        man, very unassuming, reminded very much of Glanville Smith which will mean
                        something to Florence Birch and Miss Leeson. He took off the drawing and I
                        bustled around over a few things and then went over to the hospital. The
                        first thing Walt asked me was if I had written to you. I had to say I hadn't
                        but that a letter was started and I would </p>

                        promise would not have been kept.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end his mind wandered and he talked swiftly but all about his
                        work, calculations, demanding answers and when I gave him figures he heard
                        me for he took them up and went on from there. And then quiet again. As the
                        end drew near I talked to him telling him what a wonderful life I had had
                        with him, how he was beloved by everybody, and suddenly he turned as if with
                        a great effort and looked straight in my eyes, his own wide, round, startled
                        as if it had never once occurred to him that he could die. His eyes never
                        left mine till he drew his last breath and I closed them.</p>
                    <p>A few months ago after I had several times said we must take time to go over
                        to the bank together and get my name on the account, I finally said to him
                        that we must go, that his Mars was in the 8th house which meant death
                        through accident and that if something happened to him the very fact of my
                        not having access to money might cause his death. He said but you never told
                        me that, well naturally one wouldn't. Anyway, he said, that won't happen, my
                        Mars is well aspected. I replied that had nothing to do with the case,
                        whatever the aspects, Mars in 8 meant just that. The next day we went to the
                        bank. After the decision for the operation he turned to me and said, "A pity
                        that Mars is in the 8th House isn't it." I brushed it aside and said,
                        "That's a long way off," and we both brushed the idea out of our minds. He
                        didn't want to go. Things were pouring in here and he was very happy. There
                        was a beautiful notice in the Pioneer about him which I'll send when I get a
                        moment to address them.</p>
                    <p>Night before last Mr. Mohsin had a dream confirming mine of which I had told
                        him nothing. He came to me in the morning and said he had that night dreamed
                        that Mr. Griffin and he met on the road on the bank of the River Gumti, that
                        Mr. Griffin was very joyous, very joyous, and had said many things to him
                        but that mostly he could not remember them,</p>

                    <p>he had said too many things but that one thing he had stressed and that was a
                        message to me saying to Mr. Mohsin "Be sure to remember." In Mr. Mohsin's
                        words to me - "You must lead an active life." One might think I had earned a
                        holiday but that answer to my call to him is more convincing than a dream of
                        my own could be and seems also that perhaps I should stay here. I am
                        awaiting what Mr. Nicholls says about coming over as I can't see how my work
                        here could be useful unless he was here too.</p>

                        was just exactly yourself.</p>
                    <p>I have had many loving cables and two very lovely ones from the Australian
                        Government. I can see Dr. Maloney's hand in them with his great power of
                        appreciation and his wonderful sense of justice. I don't know when I shall
                        have a chance to write to him. He did send a booklet of the Exposition to
                        Mr. James Alexander Smith but I have not yet written to him of Walter's
                        death. Will you do that for me? Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks</p>
                    <p>Tell Mr. Nicholls that the blue prints of the Paper Mill sent by ordinary
                        mail arrived today. It was under Mr. Mohsin's clever instructions and
                        watchful eye that I was able to collect our fees for that job. Also with our
                        Judge client. Mr. Mohsin insisted on taking over the bill himself and had me
                        put at the bottom of it - Mr. Mohsin sign here. He presented the bill to the
                        Judge who said the equivalent of our "right oh" and started to retire. But
                        Mr. Mohsin said, "But I must have the money or Mrs. Griffin will think I
                        have stolen it." "Oh," said the judge and gave him the money which he signed
                        for. Really I think a large part of the decline in the number of Englishmen
                        who are coming to India these days is because the Indians have decided to
                        pay none of their bills, as well as by the fact that with judicious bribery
                        Indians have replaced almost all of the British in the Civil Service.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Griffin's influence on urban architecture took place not only from his
                        general practice but also from a unique incident. When the competition was
                        called for the Tribune Building in Chicago <note>Tribune Tower, 1922</note>,
                        the eight members of the Melbourne office worked jointly and sent a set of
                        drawings which like those of Mr. Saarinen of Finland arrived too late for
                        adjudication. Even if they had been there we think the job would still have
                        gone as it did to a charming set of drawings and a harmonious adaptation of
                        Gothic motives to this Tower building, but the erection of this building
                        marked, as if time had been cut with a knife, the close of a copy book
                        architecture in the U.S. and the establishment of creative design in city
                        buildings.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly enough it was Mr. Saarinen who won the second prize in the
                        Australian Federal Capital competition with a set also of exquisite drawings
                        and a plan full of soul but not so rich in the solution of problems - not
                        dominated by the <hi rend="ul">Spirits of Mathematics</hi> (utterly
                        different from mechanical).</p>
                    <p>A book of all designs submitted was published and probably every architect in
                        Chicago has it. With Walter's was sent a statement that in city buildings
                        the structure should not be handled as an individual thing striving to hold
                        its own by its individuality of character but that the fact should be
                        recognized that the essential character of a city building was that it was
                        necessarily a parallelepipedon and that it should be handled simply as a
                        detail in the whole of the city. The two town planners recognized this and
                        in the minor motives took up this form and played with it. In the other
                        designs you felt either the effort to adapt old forms or to be original the
                        latter being mostly grotesque. When a problem is solved it is inescapable.
                        Walter, the more conscious of the two of underlying principles, stated the
                        nature of the solution of the problem in both drawing and words. The Tribune
                        building was scarcely built when along the Wacker Drive, within sight of it,
                        a whole series of buildings with the sure touch of the creative designer,
                        very beautiful, were erected, different architects but all harmonious, each
                        with</p>

                    <p>its own strong character but coming together on a basic principle. They made
                        the Tribune building, not because of its size but because of its character,
                        look like a plaything. As you stand there you see the close of the past era
                        in architecture and the opening of the new. New York swiftly followed. I saw
                        just the beginning of it when I was there.</p>
                    <p>This letter must do for the present for the expression of my gratitude for
                        the cables and letters that come from the loved ones in Australia. Curiously
                        enough Dorothy <note>Searby?</note> it was the message of you and your
                        husband, your love sending happy thoughts, that I cried over. It came as I
                        was getting up in the morning and I had a good self-pitying cry, filled also
                        with the thought that after a lifetime of self sacrifice Walter seemed to be
                        just on the point of gathering the fruits. It did me good I think but it
                        lasted only a short time when your happy thoughts poured in and took
                        possession.</p>
                    <p>You will realize now Ula <note>Maddocks</note>, that his was not a stomach
                        trouble. Nevertheless we have often expressed the desire to have some
                        information as to food combinations and immediately followed your
                        prescriptions strictly though it takes one by surprise continually if you do
                        so - no cake, no milk and flour sauces for vegetables, etc. Still we had
                        already come to prefer on the whole to do away with most combinations since
                        all things grown in this Light Ether realm seem to have especially flavoury
                        and we were enjoying each particular flavour. Love and love, Marion Mahony

                    <p>CHANGES IN INDIA</p>
                    <p>In India I was talking over with Mr. Mohsin, who is a Mohammedan, an
                        unfortunate incident which happened in connection with the celebration of a
                        Hindu festival....The young folk came to the office with their clothes
                        bespattered with red stains, symbolic of blood. To the Mohammedans this was
                        contamination and a boy had been killed. I told him that if one part of a
                        community felt like that the other part ought not to indulge in this game
                        for it was in the nature of our Halloween frolics for all its religious
                        significance. Each should be able to cross the boundaries of his own way of
                        thinking.</p>

                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 203 ====]</p>
                    <p>One afternoon I invited Mr. Mohsin's wife and daughter to afternoon tea. They
                        came in true Indian fashion in tonga <note>"covered horse cart" from
                        I.2.37</note> with curtains drawn, themselves completely veiled in their
                        formal cylindrical garment dropping from a disc on their heads and only two
                        holes for their eyes. They took off these outer garments when they came but
                        when I suggested walking across the veranda to the spiral stairs to the
                        upper quarters on the roof, on went the veils again. When we sat down in our
                        little kitchen-dining room (which from the Indian point of view were a bath
                        and dressing room) for simplifying my own work, I was surprised to learn
                        that Mr. Halder was not to be permitted to eat with us so I took tea,
                        scones, cakes and various goodies in to the drafting room for him. Afterward
                        he went with us as planned to a picture show which is helping to break down
                        the custom of the veil since our two gentlemen taking their place back of
                        us, the ladies sat in the audience room unveiled.</p>
                    <p>When I came to arrange for leaving India, I asked Mr. Mohsin if his daughter
                        would use my bicycle if I gave it to her, for Lucknow has no trams nor
                        buses, nor motor cars on hire. I chatted with him about the importance of
                        giving girls an opportunity to earn their own living in case of emergencies,
                        suggesting laughingly that he should make modern women of them. He talked
                        the matter over with his family and the next morning said his daughter would
                        love to have the bicycle so he took it over to her. I shouldn't be surprised
                        at all if she rode it still in her flowing robes and veil. I have seen a
                        number of Hindu girls on bicycles but never a veiled Mohammedan.</p>
                    <p>In those last weeks one afternoon I slipped into my living quarters and slept
                        for an hour. When I came back Mr. Mohsin looked at me with anxious eyes and
                        asked me if I was not feeling well. I told him I was just tired and had
                        taken a nap. He said, "This is the first time you have ever done that." Of
                        course the siesta is very common practice in India. In those last days he
                        said - "You are so lovely. You have such a lovely</p>
                    <pb n="204"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 204 ====]</p>
                    <p>formality." (I who was the greatest bohemian my cousin <note>Dwight
                        Perkins</note> had ever known.) And he told me that never before had he seen
                        such benevolence, not even in their religious leaders. He did not mean
                        charity for that did not enter our lives there. He meant "Well wishing" and
                        I understood him. In his really elegant English he used words carefully.
                        Through well wishing we can cross all boundaries. We can free all people
                        from their bondage to material things if to well-wishing we add correct
                        concepts. A friend once told me I had the saddest eyes she had ever seen
                        except those of one man, one who had spent his life solving the problems
                        necessary to save humanity of our time by correct concepts and definite
                        action. That sadness which comes from what we see does not indicate a
                        sadness of spirit when one has contacted those clear concepts and so can see
                        the way out of the morass we are in.</p>
                    <p>LETTERS RECEIVED DURING THE LAST DAYS IN INDIA</p>
                    <p>From Florence Birch - Dearest Marion, greatly beloved and longed for, by the
                        time this reaches you a whole eternity will have passed or been lived
                        through since your overwhelming experience of parting with your great
                        companion. Yet I must tell you how deeply grieved we were and how we were
                        filled with sorrow at every remembrance of the sudden and almost
                        unbelievable news. The fact that life had held so many difficulties for him
                        added to the pain. I hated to think too of the great slogging heavy,
                        workingman's jobs he had tackled here in connection with the theatre and its
                        plays; and how he had not been recognized here; and of the loss to the
                        world. Sorrow on sorrow mounted up involuntarily - Then there was the
                        painful thought of your utter desolation and agony in those first hours. We
                        went from one friend to another in our dismay to find that the same distress
                        prevailed and anxiety for you. So long it seemed before your first air mail
                        letter came to Mrs. Maddocks and to Mr. Nicholls from which to hear any word
                        from you. But since then there has been the great comfort of knowing that
                        you would not have us think of you as grieving.</p>

                    <p>And from our young and most able partner, Eric Nicholls:-</p>
                    <p>Dear Mrs. Griffin, Just this morning after receiving your cable, did Packie
                        ring me and we together were overwhelmed by the appalling loss the world,
                        yes the world, we here and you in particular have suffered in Walter's
                        death. His last letter to me, written between what he thought were stomach
                        attacks, had in a way worried me, but the suddenness of the final news
                        leaves me virtually expressionless and stunned. How can it be so? The
                        question goes round and round in my mind. I will eventually realize it is
                        the sad truth, but from our human point I cannot comprehend he is gone from
                        us, just vanished from our mundane lives. As you well know, both you and he
                        have supplied the aim and direction of my life and have become so much a
                        part of it that I cannot yet visualize the future without Mr. Griffin. I
                        seem to have counted on him for the next thirty years or so. And you - the
                        isolation and utter loneliness - a lump comes in my throat every time I
                        think of you. I trust you can find some solace in the thought that you were
                        favored for so long, to know him so well. He was the most unique person I
                        ever had the privilege to know, and one out of whom creative forces flowed
                        so abundantly. I could fill pages with questions of the future. You know I
                        am ever at your service. Please let me know what needs you have or help you
                        want and their fulfillment will be a privilege. I will write Molly and I am
                        sure she will write you directly. She is in Melbourne awaiting the arrival
                        in about a week's time of another soul to this earth. Our written sympathies
                        are poor props I feel but I send them fully and freely. I am daily thankful
                        that fate so favored me as to have brought me under your joint influence
                        which has been the dominant impulse of my life.</p>
                    <p>And from young Edgar Deans, the Secretary of the Greater Sydney Development
                        Association, of whom Mr. Griffin had said to me that he was the ideal
                        secretary:-</p>
                    <p>I was with him through many trials and troubles and, through all, his conduct
                        and capacity and outlook were an example and an inspiration.</p>
                    <pb n="206"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 206 ====]</p>
                    <p>He was always patient, calm, courteous - even to those who wronged him.
                        Unlike most men he never looked back nor was he ever daunted in his
                        objectives by the severest obstacles and difficulties. It was only those who
                        did not know him that said hard things about him and tried to hinder him in
                        his purposes. But those who like myself were privileged to know him well he
                        himself - W.B. Griffin - will always remain a shining light in the blackness
                        - an example and an inspiration.</p>
                    <p>And from Mr. Deans' brother to him.</p>
                    <p>I feel that his spirit does not survive only in the temples made with hands
                        according to the plans his brain fashioned - but also in the lives of folks
                        like yourself who were wise enough to see the beauty of his soul and to
                        build into your lives a design by Walter Burley Griffin more beautiful than
                        even the tower of Newman College. There can be no question that he was a
                        poet of a type that is very rare nowadays.</p>
                    <p>And from William Harte Smith, a youth who came to his own, one might say,
                        from the contact with real civilization - one which recognized the threeness
                            <note>i.e., three-ness</note> of man - body, soul and spirit - who
                        writes -</p>

                        prevail?<lb/> And hope itself can only be<lb/> a splendid dawn of sanity.</p>
                    <p>Every noon during the succeeding weeks Mrs. Stevens placed a dinner for me on
                        my living room table, and at the end of every day no sooner had the
                        draftsmen had gone than wee Hazel, not yet five, brought me in a bouquet
                        from the garden and took me in charge. Then we would prepare my supper
                        together and she would feed me like a baby spooning it into my mouth. She
                        solved the problem of cracking nuts by shutting the door on them held near
                        the hinges. Once she brushed the shells off the table onto the floor,
                        accustomed to many servants in the house, I said - "See here don't you do
                        that. You deliberately brushed them onto the floor!" She looked at me
                        severely and said - "Did you say I deliberately brushed then off?" - "Yes I
                        did." - "Don't you ebber say that to me again," she said. I didn't. Neither
                        did she.</p>
                    <p>Her mother had looked in once with solemn eyes to see if she was bothering me
                        but quickly withdrew. She knew little Hazel was a lifesaver for me.</p>
                    <p>19 July 1937 - 15 Saunders Road, Lucknow - Mrs. Stevens to Marion Mahony
                        Griffin - Dear Mrs. Griffin, Oh! We have missed you and talked much about
                        you and even little Hazel often says - Oh, Mummy, this is absolutely

                    <p>Sir Galahad (my name for her husband) is very busy and worn out. I wish I
                        could go to the office for him and let him stay home for a few days'
                        holiday. I have decided to take a full time job next year and let Steve have
                        a proper holiday. Our new home is nearly finished and you should see it. We
                        are in the throes of packing. Mr. Mohsin came to see us and said he had been
                        ill with his chest. He said that he was superintending The Pioneer building
                        and had some other work in the Chauk <note>"bazaar center" from
                        I.3.56</note>. Lots of love from us all - and a big kiss from my midget

                    <p>When the year had gone its round I was back in Castlecrag, but the round of
                        my tasks in life was not complete so all the bonds of my adult life, the
                        companionship with friends and co-workers had to be broken. Now I left
                        Castlecrag, truly a bit of Paradise on Earth, to take on the next adventure,
                        the return to the land where I was born to put my shoulder to the wheel of
                        molding the destiny of my country, to break down its boundaries in Economic
                        thinking, to transform it, the only democratic community in the world, into
                        a wholesome community, into a form which would make possible the solution of
                        problems as they arose, as the body of the human being itself continually
                        solves its ever rising problems through its threefold organization:- the
                        brain organization, the heart organization and the stomach organization.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Desmond Young says:- <hi rend="ul">A HOME TO BE PROUD OF</hi></p>
                    <p>It was a fortunate chance for The Pioneer that brought Mr. Walter Burley
                        Griffin to Lucknow. Ever since the move in July 1933, the paper had been
                        produced under great difficulties in hired premises and the location of the
                        Job Department, also in hired premises almost a mile away, was a serious
                        obstacle to co-ordination and efficient supervision. To gather the whole of
                        the enterprise together again under one roof as soon as possible was
                        obviously desirable and for some time a search had been in progress for a
                        suitable site. The finding of such a site, midway between the telegraph
                        office and the railway station, near enough to a main road for business
                        purposes but far enough back from it to escape noise and dust, and only a
                        stone's throw from the Council Chamber, coincided with Mr. Griffin's arrival
                        and the opportunity of taking advantage of his skill was too good to be
                        missed. He had been asked to submit plans for the new Library for Lucknow
                        University and these having been approved, he came from Australia to
                        supervise the erection of the building early in 1936.</p>
                    <p>A graduate of the University of Illinois, Mr. Griffin was a pioneer of the
                        town planning movement and was building "modern" houses long before the
                        modernism of Corbusier and the German school was heard of. When the
                        Commonwealth Government of Australia offered a prize for the best layout and
                        design for its new capital at Canberra, he was successful in a competition
                        open to the world, and was invited to Australia to see his designs carried
                        out. In addition to having many fine buildings to his credit he developed a
                        residential suburb of Sydney - Castlecrag - so far in advance of current
                        Australian ideas that it is only now beginning to be appreciated at its full
                        value.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Griffin threw himself into the task of designing The Pioneer's new home
                        with enthusiasm and it was both a pleasure and an education to discuss the
                        plans with him. With characteristic thoroughness he set himself to mastering
                        the fundamentals and, indeed, the details of</p>
                    <pb n="210"/>
                    <p>[Note: ==== Beginning of page 210 ====]</p>
                    <p>newspaper production so as to insure that the first essential, that of
                        "fitness for function," should be achieved. But he had great respect for
                        tradition and a great love of beauty and would never accept the theory that
                        a house is merely "a machine to live in" or a factory merely a "machine to
                        work in." When one has an opportunity to plan a building for a special
                        purpose and that purpose is the manufacture of a news paper, there is a
                        natural tendency to "go all modern" and to seek for a design which shall
                        stand out as strikingly up-to-date. Mr. Griffin suppressed any such tendency
                        on the part of his client with a firm hand. He would have been the first to
                        approve such a building as the railway station in Helsinki, for Helsinki is
                        a city only 20 years old. But he felt - and said bluntly - that
                        ultra-modernism in Lucknow would be an error of taste, in fact, bad manners.
                        As he wrote in the Pioneer, the faults of the present-day Indian
                        architecture are:-</p>
                    <p>1. A loss of feeling for design and a slovenliness in construction.</p>
                    <p>2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the
                        cultured thinkers who are in the minority.</p>
                    <p>"These tendencies," he added "are quite understandable. But in the only
                        remaining great country where religion, however people may differ about it,
                        is the dominating force in human conduct, they must be vigorously combated
                        ...... The Western world, having concentrated on making nature the servant
                        of man, is tending in "modernistic" architecture toward constituting of
                        frank utilitarianism the sole test of beauty. This is perhaps a praiseworthy
                        reaction from the state of absence of all principles save size and
                        ostentation. But for India, where religion is not forgotten and where
                        industrialism has not yet engrossed other interests, materialistic modernism
                        would be unnatural:.... The secret of artistic growth under modern
                        conditions is that everything, however trivial, must be made more and more
                        beautiful, for in that way only is progress possible."</p>
                    <p>This certainly did not mean that Mr. Griffin approved of the repetition of
                        Saracenic, European or historic Hindu styles, revived and debased,</p>

                    <p>which characterizes only too many buildings in India today. On the contrary,
                        he held that "the general run of construction in the towns is evidently the
                        worst that has ever afflicted them." Nor did it mean that he was prepared to
                        accept the conventions of verandas, chaggas, unnecessarily high ceilings,
                        etc., when he could adapt his building to the climate by more modern and
                        more efficient devices.</p>
                    <p>On this subject he is worth quoting. "The three distinct and contrasting
                        seasons of India present some apparently contradictory requirements, in the
                        United Provinces particularly," he wrote, "but these difficulties are no
                        greater than elsewhere where the temperature range is far greater. Perhaps
                        too exclusive attention has been paid to the most disagreeable season, for
                        as a result buildings are generally so dark and cheerless in the cold season
                        that artificial lights, as well as heat, are imposed upon the occupants when
                        the sun is shining brightly and warmly out of doors. Encircling verandas,
                        deemed desirable for keeping the sun off the walls, do not effectively
                        reduce the heat absorption of the building proportionately with the effort,
                        and in the case of one-story buildings this absorption is mainly
                        attributable to the roof. In characteristic internal rooms with clere-story
                        windows the proportionate roof absorption can easily be seen to be as 16 to
                        one, taking account of the incidence of the sun's rays in this low latitude
                        and the greater insulating resistance of the customary wall construction.
                        Verandas on the North should certainly be avoided for the sake of interior
                        brightness and usefulness at all seasons. On the remaining sides, so far as
                        the utility of the rooms is concerned, the device of hollow wall
                        construction, costing nothing, reduces the heat penetration one third and
                        the shadows of the trees are more effective than verandas in intercepting
                        the horizontal rays of morning and afternoon."</p>
                    <p>"The main culprit in construction which renders houses in the hot months so
                        much like bake-ovens is the roof terrace, which accumulates the sun's rays
                        for distribution during the night and succeeding days.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Young, editor of the Pioneer Press in Lucknow, India, when the building
                        was completed wrote that due to the design and the method of construction
                        they didn't even have to use the fans, so universal over there, to keep cool
                        in the hot season.</p>
                    <p>Clerestory windows ran the full length of the Press Room between the two
                        tower buildings. One of these towers was the Management Tower, the other the
                        Office building. The top floor of the 2nd terminal building is Mr. Young's
                        flat which supplements his home.</p>

                    <p>Its advantage for outdoor refuge for sleeping is not an adequate
                        compensation. Here again a vital one-third of the remedy is to be found in
                        the structural boon of hollow or cellular slabs at no cost..... The flat
                        roof is of the greatest advantage in subordinating buildings to their
                        natural surroundings and in harmonizing the relations in groups and masses.
                        Wider spans, facilitated by reinforced concrete, not only make practicable
                        large rooms but encourage greater diversity in the planning of buildings
                        than has been obtained with steel beams and jack arches of reinforced
                        brickwork."</p>
                    <p>"On the vital question of ceiling heights, there is no excuse for unnecessary
                        loftiness. For when one considers how radiant heat is transmitted from the
                        ceiling under a roof one can see that the effect of distance is almost
                        negligible. What is of real importance is the insulation above the radiant
                        ceiling, whether of confined or connecting air spaces, evaporation or
                        insulative substances or reflecting whiteness or all three of these."</p>
                    <p>Hollow walls and a reinforced concrete slab roof, 13" deep, with a cavity of
                        6", the roof being supported at the lower flanges by reinforced concrete
                        beams 4" deep and 2" wide were adopted and the soundness of Mr. Griffin's
                        theories, as well as his successful setting of the building, was shown by
                        the fact that it was possible to work in comfort in the main hall throughout
                        the hot weather of 1939 without fans. The roof was constructed on two
                        levels, thus allowing of a row of windows to give light and air from one end
                        of the hall to the other.</p>
                    <p>Equally ingenious was the plan of a carriageway under the editorial tower,
                        which allows of the reels of newsprint being taken into the Works under
                        cover during the monsoon.</p>
                    <p>On December 16, 1936, His Excellency the Viceroy did The Pioneer the honor of
                        laying the foundation-stone. On February 11, 1937, Mr. Griffin died of
                        peritonitis in King George's Hospital, to the great regret of all</p>

                        Pioneer wrote:- "as a man, Mr. Griffin was one of those few who are
                        naturally described as "too good for this world." With great charm of manner
                        and a fund of humor and good spirits, he was so entirely and so obviously
                        selfless that there was something saintly about him. He could be obstinate -
                        but only in defense of a job, to see that it was properly done. Where his
                        own interests were concerned he was only too ready to give way rather than
                        argue with those with whom he was not in sympathy. He could be intolerant
                        but only of the cheap, the shoddy, the second-rate. He had strong opinions -
                        but he was, as he himself said, always learning and kept a receptive mind.
                        Finally, he was courtesy, kindness and patience itself and lived in great
                        simplicity and happiness."</p>
                    <p>His death inevitably caused difficulties and delay, for the construction of
                        the building - and particularly the roof - was something new in India or at
                        least in Lucknow. Mrs. Griffin, herself a gifted architect with the same
                        professional qualifications as her husband, continued his work on the
                        drawings for some little time, for the details had naturally not been
                        completed. But she had to return to Australia to settle his affairs and The
                        Pioneer was again fortunate in securing the services of Mr. S.N. Irfanullah,
                        who had already been associated with Mr. Griffin on the plans of the
                        building. On him fell the full burden of supervising the construction and
                        making all the necessary calculations and drawings while it was in progress.
                        To him is due the credit for carrying out Mr. Griffin's design. But it must
                        be shared with the contractors, Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram who tackled a big
                        and far from easy job with great spirit and efficiency. The Indian mistri

                        not readily persuaded to change his ways. But Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram,
                        thanks to the personal interest and attention of the partners, saw that Mr.
                        Griffin's methods were successfully adopted. Invaluable assistance in
                        solving the problems of the roof was also given by Rai Sahib Hari Chand, the

                    <p>The very extensive electrical installation was entrusted to the G.E.C., and
                        Messrs Bottomley supplied the Hewitic arc rectifiers. The G.E.C. did a first
                        class job under difficult conditions and their Osira daylight lamps have
                        proved most successful. The arc rectifiers represent the latest method of
                        current transformation and run entirely without supervision. The plumbing
                        was efficiently carried out and all the sanitary fittings provided by the
                        Lucknow firm of Messrs Sen &amp; Sanyal. On April 2, 1939, The Pioneer
                        moved in.</p>
                    <p>The general layout is as simple as it is practical. Facing the entrance and
                        thus convenient for calling on business is the Managerial Tower. On the
                        ground floor is the office of the Job Department, the substation containing
                        the rectifying plant and the stores. On the next floor is the Manager's
                        office, the Circulation, Advertisement and Accounts Departments and the
                        Works Manager's office with a window from which every section of the Job and
                        News Department is within view. On the top floor is the Process Department
                        and the records.</p>
                    <p>Between the two towers is the Main Hall. 1908'[sic] long by 908'[sic] wide
                        with a clear run from end to end. Under its roof are the whole of the News
                        and Job Departments.</p>
                    <p>The right hand or Editorial Tower has, on the first floor, the newsprint
                        stores and the covered carriage-way to the bindery. On the top floor is the
                        Editor's flat. The sterio <note>stereotype plate?</note> plant is outside
                        the main hall, but within a few feet of the rotary press. The workshops,
                        garages, post-office, lavatories, etc., are grouped round the large,
                        brick-paved yard behind the building. Vehicles enter under the Editorial
                        Tower and drive through the yard and out by the side of the Managerial
                        Tower. The main entrance is the only entrance.</p>
                    <p>It only remains to be said that the building has stood the test of a year's
                        working so well that there has been no criticism of the accommodation

                        been praised by all who have seen it and the masses of the towers, the
                        imposing frontage and the absence of all unnecessary ornament give it a
                        dignity and beauty such as few industrial buildings possess. Above all, it
