                                    Academy of Fine Arts.
                                
            <p><a name="d0e741"></a>Landing unexpectedly, we were surprised to find ourselves in Australia;
                                       surprised at the grandeur of the coast, the great forests, the hills and
                                       flowers; marveling at the stunning birds, at the animals born with a duck's
                                       bill and the habit of laying eggs, at the pouched kangaroos everywhere and
                                       at the lovable Koala bears that weep real tears when scolded.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e744"></a>Most of all, however, we were surprised to remember that way back in a 1911
                                       world wide competition a Chicago architect named Walter Burley Griffin had
                                       won a prize of approximately $10,000. The prize was given for the best plan
                                       of the projected federal capital for this great fifth continent, to be
                                       located far from its coast, from its established metropolitan cities, in
                                       what is called the Australian bush.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e747"></a>Disembarking at Melbourne for the purpose of seeing that unique national
                                       capital, we found, once more to our surprise that, in spite of advertising
                                       proclaiming that the town "is built to the artist's plan" nobody seemed to
                                       know Mr. Griffin, know what he had done or where he was; nor did the

                                       individual nor group had power over another, a community whose basic
                                       principle is Equity. There are many lovely and wonderful people else-

                                       spiritual forces. That is the magic of the United States. The founders of

            <p><a name="d0e889"></a>The immediate task of Americans is to go out individually to every part of
                                       the world - emigrate instead of immigrate the watchword - and break down the
                                       bondage of individuals everywhere. It is a difficult but not impossible
                                       task. It is the task of path-finders. The following is the story of one such
                                       American. He found individuals wherever he went who leaped to help him blaze
                                       the way in this battle against the Powers.

                                       days in the light of this driving year into which was crowded a life's
                                       experience and a life's work. Few indeed are the architects who have put
                                       forth such an amount, such a range, of work with such a richness and variety
                                       of design as fruited in this one year.

                                       that fall, fighting fire at midnight on the rocks of Castlecrag to which he
                                       so willingly sacrificed himself. An operation, a few days of his body's
                                       fight for recovery from the wounds inflicted in a brave attempt to overcome
                                       the difficulty, with no thought but of recovery in either of our minds, and
                                       then the slowing heart, the coma when I poured into his ear the wonder of
                                       the life I had had with him; and then he was a free man indeed going on to
                                       his next task into which one knew he would throw himself with the same ardor
                                       with which he had tackled every opportunity of this incarnation, every
                                       opportunity to solve the problems for a present civilization. And one knew
                                       that he would not ask for easier tasks in his next incarnation but would
                                       rejoice in new faculties developed in readiness for tackling harder tasks
                                       still on his return.

            <p><a name="d0e929"></a>At five in the morning I left the hospital and walked the five miles home,
                                       much of it along the river bank, in the cool fresh quiet. As I turned into
                                       the gate our Indian gardener came to meet me with questioning eyes. I lifted
                                       my hands, for like my mother I always talk with my hands, and said "He is
                                       gone." With a startled look he turned and fled. He too had felt the
                                       sweetness of the segnor <a name="27"></a> [Note: senor?, i.e., Walter Burley Griffin]. He
                                       would not have had the blow fall on him. But a short time before his pretty,
                                       gentle little wife had been ill, was possessed as they say. They lived in
                                       the service quarters on the place. Our neighbor in the other half of our
                                       palace told us what they were doing. The chanting voice of their physician

                                       should not die, that the demon they were exorcising should take someone
                                       else, there were so many in the household. The next day she was better. In a
                                       few days she was well and Mr. Griffin was gone. One does not say these
                                       things do not happen but one can know that by whatever means the crossing of
                                       the boundary came about it was brought about because Mr. Griffin himself had
                                       decided that that step should be taken. He will return when he is ready for
                                       the next task.

            <p><a name="d0e943"></a>The message had come to a busy office asking Griffin to go to India. In
                                       asking him for sketches for a library for the Lucknow University, they had
                                       suggested that he send them alternative sketches one with the Indian feeling
                                       - the other completely modern. That was not Griffin's way. When the office
                                       saw his sketches it was unanimously agreed that in the one design he had met
                                       both requirements of his client for the building was thoroughly in harmony
                                       with Indian architecture and yet was completely modern. They accepted his
                                       design and asked him to come to India. We all agreed that it was high time
                                       that Griffin, who never took holidays, should go on a vacation. His young
                                       partner, Mr. Nicholls, had come to maturity in all ways and could carry on
                                       in the interim in Sydney. Preparations for departure were rushed through and
                                       again he ran away from his wife on this new adventure beyond the boundaries.

                                       been moving swiftly lately, so I'll tell you recent history

                                       there. As he says, these have been his three days of grace, and ours for we

            <p><a name="d0e957"></a>For several months now, there has been a lively correspondence by air mail
                                       and cable between Walt and Mr. Alagappan <a name="29"></a> [Note: Alagappan Mudalir], an
                                       Indian contractor, who has been doing important work in India for some time
                                       and who has now asked Walt to act an architect, consultant, in a building
                                       company he has formed. The connection was made through Mrs. <a name="30"></a> [Note: Ula]
                                       Maddocks who is tremendously interested in Walt's architecture, and a great
                                       barracker for it, and Mr. <a name="31"></a> [Note: Ronald] Craig, her friend and ours, a
                                       young man who went to India about three years ago, who has married an Indian
                                       girl and has a fine son, a remarkable looking baby. Mr. Craig has raised a
                                       beard since he went over there which gives him quite an Oriental look. He is
                                       a journalist and an enterprising man.

            <p><a name="d0e969"></a>The first outcome of the connection was that Mr. Alagappan consulted Walt re
                                       the foundations of a huge Buddhist temple they are building. They are not in
                                       sympathy with the Europeanizing of the architecture there and Walt agrees
                                       with them that Indian architecture is a living thing which can't be said of
                                       architecture elsewhere in the world except, we think, in Walt's hands.

            <p><a name="d0e972"></a>Next Mr. Alagappan, who has done some building for the Lucknow University,
                                       asked him to make sketch plans for a library for the University suggesting
                                       two, one Indian, one European. Instead he sent one which looks and feels
                                       quite Indian and yet is the last word in modernism. Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls
                                       both worked on the drawings and it was a beautiful set. They were submitted
                                       to the Chancellor, a meeting was called and a cable came - "Plans accepted,
                                       come on first boat" and off he has gone.

                                       and said - "I am going to lead it." You don't often get that sort of a
                                       remark from Walt but as I said to Mrs. Maddocks, - who by the way has bought
                                       a house here, she and her husband, a musician, and their baby, bouncing 18
                                       months old Deirdre being very pleasant neighbors - he went at that problem
                                       as if the future of all India hung on its proper solution. But of course
                                       that is the way he tackles all problems.

                                       and Anthroposophically. It is seldom that a European goes into India at the
                                       invitation of an Indian, not just as a social guest but to assist in solving
                                       their present problems. Dr. Steiner says it is extremely important that the
                                       East, especially India, and the West should come together on terms of mutual
                                       understanding and sympathy. No one could be better than Walt from this
                                       angle. Miss <a name="33"></a> [Note: Ruth Janet (Lute)] Drummond, who is now the General
                                       Secretary of the Anthroposophic Society in Australia, is all excitement over
                                       it though we hardly know how we can get along without him here in our new
                                       undertakings.

            <p><a name="d0e1014"></a>It was Walt who in the necessarily united professions of Architecture and
                                       Town Planning carried on the work of Louis Sullivan in raising architecture
                                       in America and the world to professional standards in creative design and in
                                       really solving problems. Through such seed the break-away from the bondage
                                       to tradition has become an established thing in America and bit by bit we
                                       see signs of his work in Town Planning coming to fruition in practice there,
                                       the standard for which was set in the Canberra design in 1912 which laid the
                                       foundation for community planning. Recently Walt said to me that he had as
                                       yet seen nothing done in Town Planning that was not laid down in the
                                       Canberra plan, and he was constantly on the lookout. You will perhaps
                                       remember his first words when he received

                                       requiring radial thoroughfares wide enough for all kinds of traffic, and the
                                       other requiring the complete elimination of acute angles by bringing in the
                                       distributive narrower streets at right angles to the thoroughfares. The
                                       third requirement is the bringing of the country into the city by making all
                                       residential blocks large enough in area to enclose open parks and
                                       playgrounds in their interior thus taking up no street frontage and so being

                                       four of the prizes were given to practically exact replicas of a house he
                                       had erected while still in Chicago and which was widely published. None of
                                       them were quite so perfect as his own. I myself had seen that problem
                                       struggled over in various offices of good architects, unsuccessfully, and
                                       when I went into his office it was with astonishment that I watched
                                       solutions drop from his pencil one after another each a perfect little
                                       classic and each totally different from the others like the children of

                                       reaching you at Adelaide so will just drop a line. I can't go in early today
                                       as Mr. Nicholls is bringing out that man this afternoon and I promised him a
                                       cup of tea. I did not find the Bhagavad-Gita I thought I had, but another,
                                       not in poetry, which Mrs. Maddocks must have left here. Am sending it to
                                       Perth. The best of all translations is that of Dhan Gopal Mukerji. Am also
                                       sending the prints in the Home Magazine of our open air production in the
                                       valley of "Iphigeneia." I couldn't bear to spoil your happy departure by
                                       speaking of the catastrophe of Anna Ickes' death. Aside from the grief at
                                       the loss of a very dear friend I feel that an important connection with
                                       affairs over there has been broken and that's a great misfortune. But since
                                       we can no longer hold the completely unscientific concept of things
                                       happening by chance I feel that perhaps it was more important that she
                                       should be back here toward the close of the century than that she should
                                       remain here now.

            <p><a name="d0e1108"></a>10 October, 1935, Castlecrag, New South Wales, Dear Walt, I sent a letter
                                       yesterday to the boat in Adelaide but the P.O. man insisted it needn't go by
                                       air so I sent it regular and I bet you didn't get it. (He didn't.) Was there
                                       any later train by which you could have reached your boat? Inconceivable!
                                       Had a pleasant evening at Anthro with Mr. McDowall in charge. Was sorry you
                                       had to start off with the sad news of Anna Ickes' death. I think you should
                                       write to Mr. Ickes. Enclosed is my note to him.

                                       than we are on with another. She wants to enrich the play with angel and
                                       archangel tableaux and song and instrumental music.

                                       Mr. Ickes, One's heart stands still with such a shock as that of the news of
                                       Anna's death. One turns this way and that to keep from being filled with
                                       pessimism at such a catastrophe. We feel we must have some basis for
                                       understanding. We are told that this is a critically important century and I
                                       find myself saying that important as Anna's work was here there must be
                                       urgent necessity for her to assist in the more critical times toward the end
                                       of the century and she has been hurried away so that she may be back for
                                       that work. It does not satisfy the heart but it helps us to understand that
                                       there is no such thing as chance and that Anna's own will as well as that of
                                       the Hierarchies stood ready to make the necessary sacrifices, and we school
                                       ourselves to do the same. With love to you and the young folk, Marion.

            <p><a name="d0e1128"></a>12 October, 1935 Perth, West Australia. Dear Alderman Parker, Mr. Palmer
                                       Moffat wanted me to give you the enclosed note some time ago but I found no
                                       chance to do so at an opportune time when our affairs were under Council's
                                       consideration and particularly in the rush of leaving for this sudden
                                       professional call to Lucknow. I wanted to talk over thoroughly and answer
                                       any of your questions concerning our long relationship to the Willoughby
                                       Council with whom we have tried our best to cooperate through considered
                                       land planning methods to save for future ages the last remnant of Sydney's
                                       once unparalleled harbour in the face of puzzling lack of sympathy and
                                       support officially.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1131"></a>The vital difficulty is that our plans for preserving the landscape and
                                       dedicating the foreshores for public benefit is constantly jeopardized by
                                       pressure for cash where there is no cash to squeeze out during a period when
                                       there has been no income nor any business, nor hope of disposing of a foot
                                       of land for nearly seven years on end. None of our creditors has any
                                       intention whatever of carrying on with our plans involving the sacrifice of
                                       lookouts, the water frontage and other most valuable parts from which they
                                       could most readily realize cash when the demand returns; nor of saving the
                                       forests which they have already been clearing away in the cases where they
                                       have already come into possession. Our acquisition of such parts as
                                       "Castlecrag Cape Estate" was at great cost and undertaken solely because of
                                       the need to save thousands of feet of water front whose subdivision into
                                       lots the District Court had, after much litigation, compelled the Council to
                                       accept with no reservation whatever for public access to the water.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1134"></a>The destructive operations were being rushed when I finally intervened paying
                                       as much as ten pounds per foot to recover water front lots

                                       reservation was then incorporated in our project submitted to Council.
                                       Unfortunately the Valuer General mistook this defensive measure as a basis
                                       for increased valuation with resultant rates that have accrued at a greater
                                       rate than I could in my practice earn money to keep up with, whilst not a
                                       foot of the land has been marketable at any price whatever.

                                       Valuer General, at the present lowest known period, the Council will have
                                       benefited by the rates so out of proportion that they cannot be otherwise
                                       met except through abandonment and loss of the prospective continuous
                                       foreshore reservation for the whole of Willoughby as provided for in the
                                       plans of our development. I was able to show Council in 1928 how easily the
                                       complete project could be realized with our help when conditions were less
                                       propitious generally than they are now or ever can be again. Whatever more I
                                       can do in this direction I hope there will be opportunity for me to offer
                                       when I return in three months. Yours faithfully, Walter B. Griffin.

            <p><a name="d0e1151"></a>14 October, 1935, Castlecrag. Dear Walt, This morning I climbed the gum tree
                                       and sawed off the parts that were contacting the four telephone wires. They
                                       were growing so beautifully it seemed a shame but the tree doesn't look bad
                                       now and the widespreading branches will soon put things entirely to rights I
                                       am sure. It seemed like old times to be climbing trees. I was famous for
                                       that in my childhood, climbing trees the boys couldn't climb.

                                       of flannel flowers and I dressed up in my Chinese gown which tickled them

                                       go to the Castlecrag Dais. Mr. Stoker has the evening - two plays and a
                                       lecture. Miss Crabb was pleased with our beloved Pholiota <a name="35"></a> [Note: house]
                                       plan. A one room house should suit her as well as it did us in those good
                                       old days. Love Marion.

            <p><a name="d0e1178"></a>15 October, 1935, Dear Gene, All kinds of things have piled up in connection
                                       with Walt's departure and the aftermath of the Festival so will just send on
                                       these things. Walt has a three month round ticket but that gives him only
                                       one month in India so we are assuming he will extend his visit to stay six
                                       months anyway. Nicholls' last words to him were "If there is anything to
                                       stay for, why stay." and mine were the same. His acting as consultant for a
                                       busy organization will not interfere with his practicing privately any more
                                       than his work with the Federal Capital did. There is no telling what may
                                       develop. Tell Clarmyra the finger paints arrived all right. Many thanks.

                                       latter Isobel Grey wrote as follows:- "Mr. and Mrs. Burley Griffin have
                                       established at Castlecrag, Middle Harbour, the most beautiful little theatre
                                       conceivable. Adventure is the keynote of the evening and you experience a
                                       quickening thrill of excitement as you take the winding road in Castlecrag
                                       that leads down to the Haven Scenic Theatre - and the Past. It is a dark,
                                       narrow road out into the deadly stillness, and menaced on either side by
                                       overlapping ti-scrub. You feel apprehensively that the road might lead
                                       anywhere - that anything might happen in this strange place with only the
                                       stars for witness. But the mood is gone when you turn a bend and come upon
                                       other cars parked and groups of people making their way to the seats, with
                                       subdued laughter. Flares are lit here and there behind the tall trees so,
                                       from where we are, only the sparks that every now and then fly out into the
                                       darkness are visible. Gracious gums with the stars caught in their hair
                                       watch calmly and serenely, so wise in their ancient knowledge that has grown
                                       into leaves and branches, from seed to seed, forever nourished by the winds
                                       blowing in from across the sea. Now everything is hushed as from the Temple
                                       steals a strain of music, wild and sweet and haunting, that seems to hold in
                                       the rise and fall of every drawn-out note a sad lament for things that are
                                       no more."

                                       the Gods and his message to man giving him the gift of anger, the fire

                                       I love to tell everybody that it was your parting shot. Am having a great
                                       thrill feasting off our own loquats. Every morning I gather a dozen big
                                       ones. So far my eating expenses are nil. The girls bring out so much Sundays
                                       when they come to rehearsals that I live on it the rest of the week. Went to
                                       the dentist yesterday. Though I haven't been for over a year he didn't find
                                       anything to do except clean them. With an air of resignation he said they
                                       were strong teeth and would last me my lifetime. I fancy he may not have
                                       counted on that decision of ours to live for a hundred and fifty years -
                                       only way to get through what we have undertaken.

            <p><a name="d0e1244"></a>25 October, 1935 - S.S. Mongolia - Dearest Marion, Your letter to the boat in
                                       Adelaide was forwarded and reached me at Perth. When I read your letter I
                                       marveled at your restraint at the parting, realizing your deep affection for
                                       Anna. So far as my connection with Government is concerned we have had
                                       enough to realize that the less we have of it the better for our welfare and
                                       usefulness. Our Karma is in the opposite camp surely. I enclose my letter to
                                       Mr. Ickes which I hope he will take in the right spirit. The wild flower
                                       season was on in Perth so I walked from the interesting University buildings
                                       back to Perth through the open forest, largely banksias. The main impression
                                       was that given by the scarlet Kangaroo Paws in patches of acres in extent.
                                       The species of bush flowers are different but chiefly of the same genera as
                                       at Castlecrag but on the whole the bush was no more floriferous and far less
                                       attractive in the formation and freedom from disheveled and weedy growths
                                       than is Castlecrag. From the Leschnaultia biloba in the shops I realized
                                       that there were sky blue heaths to be seen in other directions on the sand
                                       hills but I did not have time to seek them out.

            <p><a name="d0e1247"></a>Though approaching the size of Adelaide, Perth is by no means so dignified
                                       and gives the impression of rawness and newness which will disappear
                                       sometime when the advantage of a waterfront site, much like Canberra with
                                       the lakes, is realized. Mr. Davidson, the State Town Planner on whom I
                                       called, is fully aware of the similarity and the possibilities and is using
                                       his strong influence toward directing the official architectural development
                                       onto the Perth Water Terraces where formal reclamation parkways are being
                                       formed all across the city area.

                                       visit to Perth, Mr. Davidson wants to bring the Premier to Fremantle to give
                                       me an official welcome which might work out to the ultimate advantage of
                                       both of us as Town Planners. He is the one who got me to send him an
                                       exhibition of our architectural work in 1930 which he displayed in spite of
                                       the determined opposition of the Perth architects whom also he has sized up
                                       fairly well. The Mongolia was due to leave Fremantle at 8 P.M. but when I
                                       got on board then there was a telephone call from a newspaper reporter who
                                       had a consignment from his editor to interview me. Since the ship did not
                                       actually leave until 9 P.M. he came out by car 12 miles and discussed
                                       various and sundry matters while I ate my dinner. Don't apprehend any more
                                       of these garrulous effusions once I get ashore. Lovingly your worser half.

                                       news of Mrs. Ickes death reached Australia only just as I left on this
                                       voyage of extension of my architectural fields to India. Only in thinking of
                                       what my own wife means to me, the Marion Mahony of whom Anna Wilmarth had
                                       been such a friend and benefactor, can I appreciate how tragic is this loss
                                       to you. Religion hardly softens such a blow because faith has so little
                                       validity any more. As a compensation however we are beginning to meet
                                       evidence of wide-awake contact with life forces themselves so that human
                                       understanding can be and is being extended for the making of an actual
                                       science out of those mysteries that must always baffle physical science but
                                       whose existence need not on that account be denied. Oriental life has always
                                       been actuated by a sublime spiritual consciousness that Occidentals are
                                       weaned away from, but the former have consequently a more realistic
                                       acceptance of death which only a future understanding can restore to us;-

            <p><a name="d0e1302"></a>30 October, 1935 - Perfect weather has continued in Ceylon. On landing
                                       Wednesday I made first for the native city where I got my ice-cream suit,
                                       etc. and thereafter landed in Fremjee House, a guest house on the fringes of
                                       the Cinnamon Gardens district which is a very beautiful suburb 3 miles out.
                                       The house is an old Parsi mansion facing the ocean. It is run by two English
                                       women one of whom, Miss Sheppard, started it in opposition to the two huge

                                       native legislature, all the administration is manned and managed by the
                                       Cingalese who are more apt than the Europeans in learning in the schools and
                                       who have qualified themselves in English Universities for all the
                                       professional positions. Of course that does not make the government better
                                       (only the separation of the three functions can do that) than they were
                                       before any more than woman suffrage in Australia did but it must, of course,
                                       make the governing less objectionable.

                                       State, also with public services, hospitals and welfare institutions of all
                                       kinds including incineration. The wages so far as I can judge amount to
                                       $0.50 a day where they get any, but expenses for them are almost
                                       proportionally low, and need of shelter and clothes almost negligible.
                                       Except for a few red brick essays of the time of Victoria it seems
                                       impossible for the builders, native or English, ever to have done so badly
                                       in any class of buildings as the British have perpetrated in the Colonies of
                                       America or on the Pacific Ocean in every class of building. As I had
                                       suspected, the prototype of those neo-classic houses in Melbourne that
                                       attracted me so much is here also - of that back-block type of Australia's
                                       oldest house, that of McArthur at Paramatta. Nothing therefore in
                                       Architecture originated in Australia! The walled suburban lanes of
                                       residential places with truly tropical verdure are as attractive as any
                                       suburbs I have ever seen anywhere but the houses of the Europeans are apt to
                                       be out of key. The roads are everywhere consistently good and the aesthetic
                                       standard as to electric wiring is distinctly superior to that allowed by the
                                       Sydney Municipal Council. Mr. Craig is coming to Bombay to meet me which

                                       Griffin as her mother might be wanting it. Saturday evening Mr. Morton at
                                       the Neighborhood Group gave an interesting talk on the romance of Ritual.
                                       Saw Bergner in "Escape Me Never." She is a great actress though she hasn't
                                       the voice of a Bernhardt. Are these same pictures running in India? It's
                                       worth seeing though you wouldn't get the same kind of satisfaction out of it
                                       that I did. It's the story of a genius and his gypsy wife!!! The Morton's
                                       lost out on getting the Cheong house <a name="40"></a> [Note: for the Rev. Cheong Cheok
                                       Hong] and they deserved to with their silly dickering. Friends of the
                                       Johnston's have taken it. Mr. Morton said he is doing good business with the
                                       Anthro books and will have to be getting more of them.

                                       Ula (Maddocks from Ronald Craig), Instead of Saturday morning last, the
                                       "Chitral" got in at Bombay at 11 p.m. the previous night. There was a large
                                       crowd down to meet the Australian cricketers. I was a one man team to meet a
                                       one man team and our greeting was considerably the more extensive in time
                                       and intensity. Before midnight we were sitting in chairs to review the
                                       present situation of the universe, - Steiner or Krishnaji? We got away from
                                       them both. It was Walter Burley Griffin and an aggressive delighted
                                       listener. A moment later the deck hands were making a preliminary survey for
                                       their mop work. On the nearest clock tower that moment proved to be five
                                       hours. I went to my hotel near the wharf and turned in an hour before
                                       sunrise. Three hours later I went down to the boat again. We got through the
                                       customs and walked along to my hotel. Here we resumed our discussion which
                                       the absurdity of sleep had interrupted. But after a couple of hours a
                                       conscience clutched me. A builder of cities was sitting under an indoor
                                       punkha when the jabberwocky panorama of Bombay was futilely beckoning to
                                       him. So we got up and went to Cooks on my bashful initiative. During the
                                       stroll around there Bombay had its chance but it never looked a winner. The
                                       things on which India's second largest municipality prides itself were
                                       accepted as the bread and butter of architectural diet. The sweets of the
                                       meal were castigated as unwholesome and nasty. But the genius of the pont
                                       was still shameless as we walked into the tourist bureau. Behind the counter
                                       was a clerk in charge of railway bookings. For a minute we sat and feigned
                                       interest in his time-table researches. Then some decorative posters
                                       suggested how Muslim monotheism had tortured the fecundity of Hindu
                                       poly-cum-monotheism. It was a great cultural opportunity for the clerk too
                                       but he spent the next one and a half hours in a comfortable

                                       Meanwhile I plucked the strings of the harp with clumsy conversational
                                       fingers while the unmanageable instrument nevertheless yielded a smooth and
                                       steady melody of thought. (My prompt notes were from "One and Many" to be
                                       found in "Do What You Will" whose author, Aldous Huxley, was anathema to the
                                       harp. So does the violin chafe against the bow.)

            <p><a name="d0e1387"></a>Bombay lay all uninspected, choked up with cheap pride, as we hurried back to
                                       be last for lunch at the hotel. The waiter served us with everything on a
                                       sufficiently extensive menu. We told him we were vegetarians but he must
                                       have thought we would never be fanatical about such matters as I recall
                                       dallying with fish and chicken bones. I am not sure now what was digesting
                                       within us as we went to the lift for upstairs and our bedrooms, connected by
                                       a common bathroom. We veered into one of these rooms and I was the little
                                       artisan helping the masterbuilder to erect ever more permanent theses when a
                                       waiter tried to thrust us in twain with an afternoon tea-tray. We pacified
                                       this irritant intruder in the easiest way by consuming what he had brought.
                                       This kept the body going for another listening bout of a quarter of a tin of
                                       cigarettes' duration.

            <p><a name="d0e1390"></a>An unseen Bombay was growing dark. We were establishing our next thesis in a
                                       bus bound for Malabar Hill and the master builder took his eye off the work
                                       to make some unmalicious but wholly unappreciative comments on the
                                       environment sliding by. From the foot we walked to the top of Malabar Hill
                                       and looked down on the lights of the city. What had been ignored or had
                                       produced indifference now received a verbal caress or so which it should
                                       have valued had it known the real authority of the one who gave them. But
                                       the talk turned to the peculiarities of clients and the necessity of
                                       chastening their unaesthetic ambitions and giving them what they really
                                       wanted without their knowing it. We were, not unnaturally, the last to
                                       commence dinner after we had found a bus to carry a continuing conversation

            <p><a name="d0e1401"></a>Next morning we made a mock inspection of Victoria Gardens. But while the
                                       masterbuilder had seemed blandly unaware of buildings without meaning, about
                                       'birds and beasts and flowers' - particularly the last - he was singularly
                                       perspicacious and I tried to learn a pack of relative facts concerning the
                                       flora of the land I had loitered in unobservantly for over a couple of
                                       years. On this Sunday afternoon we took a boat across the harbour to the
                                       island that has the Elephants caves on whose walls are Hindu sculpturing.
                                       Bombay's Harbour won golden opinions and the city should have blushed a
                                       little at praise it had been unable to earn the previous day. In the caves I
                                       found the richest aesthetic satisfaction I have found in India. To my
                                       instructor they were not this but something that contained many of the
                                       rudiments of good architecture. I remember that his camera shutter clicked a
                                       lot and that has since proved a sure sign of his favouring appraisal. I
                                       could have written this letter about those sculpture pieces but my reader
                                       (assuming that she has borne with me to this point) must be told more of
                                       Walter Burley Griffin's response to India.

            <p><a name="d0e1404"></a>Dear Vishnu! but Walter Burley Griffin has seen things! We have had
                                       phenomenally good luck. In five or six days there has been a feast that I
                                       believe would exhaust the digestive powers, nay, shatter the gravity, of any
                                       living architect that I can imagine other than him. If I had his perception
                                       of the whole architectural significance I should be suffering from high
                                       blood pressure in the region of the mind. But he is sitting at the same
                                       table, filling my pad with a pen, and within coo-ee of an unexamined New
                                       Delhi which will presently be submitted to the closest and most balanced
                                       scrutiny that will have occurred in its life. What has happened between
                                       Delhi and Bombay I can't describe now. If it had been less eventful I would
                                       have had a shot at it, but as it is I can only enumerate.

            <p><a name="d0e1431"></a>idea of going to Agra. On Monday night at Khansi we marked that the next stop
                                       would be Gwalior. Mr. Griffin looked edgy and infinitely acquisitive about
                                       the name. I remembered that Malati Patwharden's sister, a school friend of
                                       Komalam's, is the wife of the principal of a college there for princes. I
                                       had a chat with the station master and as a result of his information we
                                       broke our journeying and camped in the waiting room for the short balance of
                                       the night. In the early morning I rang the Fort and got on to Pierce, the
                                       school principal. He was the best host we could possibly have had. He is
                                       keenly interested in architectural values, knew the worth of what he was
                                       living amidst and steered us well.

                                       His wife, Ansuya, was the first specimen of unsophisticated but effortlessly
                                       cultured Indian womanhood that Walter Burley Griffin had met and it was a
                                       good meeting. There was also a young Bengal artist whose work I drank in
                                       very hungrily, and who won more terse valuable appreciation from my senior
                                       companion also. The glories of Gwalior are not for this letter but I believe
                                       that they will stand out in anything that he is writing. The next piece of
                                       architecture that we inhabited was the second class waiting room at the Agra
                                       Cantonment station. We were in it for a sleeping night and Walter Burley
                                       Griffin approved its structure with slight occasional snores, while I smoked
                                       and thought.

                                       be criticized," he said. But I could write a letter on what he did say. I
                                       now felt that I could discuss the Taj with more pith borrowed from him than
                                       anyone I am likely to meet for some time yet. But you must take it as read
                                       without my even suggesting it here. The Agra Fort again proved to be a
                                       collection of marvels. But I was at the side of sane, deliberate, cautious
                                       approval. From Agra on Wednesday we went to Akhbar's abandoned capital,
                                       Fatephur Sikri, and again used a station waiting room as a hotel. But before

                                       parts of the city in the moonlight. There were jackals amongst the ruins
                                       which were very little decayed - only empty. Everything in it brought the
                                       swiftest pleasure to Walter Burley Griffin who found it an intelligently
                                       planned city of beautiful ingredients. On our return he seemed to sleep very
                                       well on what he had seen.

            <p><a name="d0e1458"></a>We spent the bulk of the morrow's daylight in the city. He was tireless and
                                       brought the total of camera exposures up to 80 since landing. After five
                                       hours of inspection in an only moderately lenient sun, I sped for retreat to
                                       a refreshment house. We had had tea and biscuits and nothing since. He
                                       said:- "With age it is the eyes that hamper one (He was looking at a
                                       guide-book plan of the city) but with youth it is the tummy." I parried with
                                       - "But my hindrance can be remedied." And so it was. But he was dreaming of
                                       town-planning for Akhbar while he drank his tea. And we got up to spend
                                       three more hours seeing what has been done in that way. I enjoyed them all,
                                       but in him it touched a conscious depth that I cannot unclose. We got back
                                       to Agra at night (last night) under a three quarter moon. The spell was on
                                       us for an hour and a half and then we walked forcibly out of it. Where to? A
                                       cinema show. The Begum's tomb floated behind the screen. Why indeed is Bing
                                       Crosby? During the day we had seen a city charged with art in every quarter.
                                       And here was a man singing a babyish squall as though it too had a faint
                                       savour of art. The pretense was too thin, but the egregious Bing went right
                                       on full of an asinine sincerity that is bred only a long way to the West.
                                       There was a girl in the film supposed to be a princess but she was really a
                                       mannequin without knowing it, a mannequin's soul, body, clothes and acting
                                       art. I smoked the program through in I hope not too sullen a contempt. I
                                       believe there is no art with such infinite possibilities as the cinema, but
                                       at present it is a slobbering babe.

            <p><a name="d0e1502"></a>8 November, 1935 Delhi. - from Walter Burley Griffin - Marion dearest. The
                                       Vice-Chancellor of Lucknow University had suggested to Mr. Craig that I
                                       might see things on my way so we have only this morning reached our last
                                       way-station here. The journey has been just one succession of thrills.
                                       Bombay, the most enterprising of Indian Cities, did not excite much
                                       sight-seeing on my part after having sat up yarning with Mr. Craig on the
                                       Chitral until 4:30 A.M. Saturday. So we did not do much but use our tram and
                                       bus excursions around town for continuing our conversations. Sunday however
                                       we spent on a boat excursion to the ancient rock temples of Elephanta which
                                       are on an island in the wonderfully beautiful Bay of Bombay which is of the
                                       character and equal in charm to anything we saw in the South Pacific
                                       tropics, and wholly unspoilt. The old Hindu sculpture is stately and the
                                       architectural ensemble grandly impressive and refined as well. These smaller
                                       caves were so satisfactory that I left for some other time the greater ones
                                       at Ellora (Architecture) and Agunta <a name="43"></a> [Note: Ajunta] (Painting) which
                                       would have required lengthy side trips taking several days.

            <p><a name="d0e1508"></a>Routed via Agra and Delhi we made our first stop-over after a night and a day
                                       on the train passing through rich and varied country both jungle and
                                       cultivated, the latter with black soil and endless cornfields (maize) verily
                                       like Illinois. That stop-over was a tremendous sensation, the vast Hindu
                                       fortress and palace of Gwalior, deserted except for the school of an
                                       Englishman married to a Brahmin who were known to Mr. Craig, the only other

                                       waiting-rooms with the most successful rubber bed, was the Taj Mahal in the
                                       morning sun-light. To me this was no less breath-taking than to any devotee
                                       who has ever sung its praises, and quite independent of the fact that,
                                       architecturally, I could see many things that should have been altogether
                                       different. The pure fresh sparkling crystalline Italian marble, like white
                                       Angaston, South Australia, or Georgia, U.S.A., with the delicious graded
                                       shadows of its vast rounded concave and convex niches and domes present a

            <p><a name="d0e1522"></a>A day later - Last night after a stroll of an hour and a half on the
                                       terraces, daises, lawns, parterres and water gardens; and amongst the
                                       luxurious and heavily scented trees, and in the moonlight, we found some
                                       particular points of view that met every requirement of the architectural
                                       imagination even. One of these was from the inner side of the base of a
                                       corner minaret putting the multiple arches between the massive pylons and
                                       eliminating the neck-like drum of the dome. Another was from the trees at
                                       one side of the vast Persian Garden where the general proportions of the
                                       monument were masked and the imagination allowed to form a vast Arabian
                                       concept. Another was looking across the central marble platform of the
                                       garden with the eye exactly level therewith so that a long marble stylobate
                                       was added to the foreshortened Mahal together with its four minarets.
                                       Unfortunately none of these aspects could ever be photographed even in the
                                       daylight. But they served to show how no merely architectural considerations
                                       of static balance of forces could apply to the "most beautiful building in
                                       the world."

                                       has spent altogether ten years in jail with lesser terms for all his family
                                       as well as another of the martyrs who was present. Then we went by train to
                                       the Fatephur Sikri <a name="45"></a> [Note: Fatehpur Sikri] and after an hour's ride were
                                       able to explore in the moonlight and suddenly come upon the vast pyramid of
                                       steps leading to the mighty arch portal of the Jami Mashid behind which for
                                       miles extended the virtually intact palatial section of the completed Moghul
                                       Capital City of the Emperor Akbar in the 16th Century. Though the only
                                       inhabitants at that time of day were jackals whom we both heard and saw, we
                                       were soon followed in by two would-be guides from the Fatephur village lying
                                       in front of and below the city. We left before midnight because of their
                                       warnings that the jackals would thereafter be in packs, but the impression
                                       of splendor and vastness of the red sandstone city thus gained was only
                                       enhanced by the explorations during the whole of the following day through
                                       agoras, caravansaries, fortifications, waterworks, innumerable vaulted and
                                       elaborately decorated baths, stepped terraces, five storied pavilions,

                                       mosques, minarets, galleries, balconies, passageways, and the public and

                                       elaborately carved, inlaid and screened with delicately filigreed stone
                                       panels. Equally elaborate were enormous stables for their horses, and still
                                       more extensive the housing of camels and elephants, throughout with floors
                                       and roofs as well as walls of dressed red sandstone.

                                       - It would be quite impossible to keep minutes on my carbon pad of a
                                       fraction of the impressions I have gained thus far in India. They would be
                                       abstracted to the degree of platitudes. However I think most of them are
                                       deep enough to keep until I get home. Though my contacts are quite
                                       superficial and the difference of language sets up an effective barrier yet
                                       I believe I already feel more <u>at home with these people</u>
                                       than I was for many years in Australia, and the soldiers seem to be the only
                                       antipathetic ingredient.

            <p><a name="d0e1562"></a>We arrived here Monday morning after three days in Delhi of the same perfect
                                       conditions that have obtained throughout the trip, and were met by Mr.
                                       Alagappan at the station. This hotel which I hope to leave today for a more
                                       economical boarding house, is only less luxurious than the Swiss Hotel where
                                       we stopped one day or so at Delhi. The private rooms are arranged around U
                                       shaped garden court yards and consist of two stories of arcaded verandas
                                       with lounge bed room in front and dressing room and modern bath room at the
                                       back. In Delhi there were four rooms in each suite and the luggage was
                                       delivered into the dressing room at the back. The modern sections of all
                                       these cities are parklike areas of magnificent distances, tree-vaulted
                                       avenues, walled or balustraded gardens acres in area, with stepped
                                       balustraded flat roofs on massive plastered walls with rich arched and
                                       linteled decorative openings and grills usually tinted a delightful ecru
                                       with white trim.

                                       because of the intensive building activity of the late years at Delhi, and

                                       site of one of these rulers' palaces with some remnants preserved as
                                       historic monuments. Wide open and parklike spaces mark the sites of the old
                                       bazaars or commercial areas. The present city extends for miles to the
                                       southward and contains some recent ambitious but uninteresting buildings
                                       such as the Legislative Assembly, the Post Office and some Cinemas by our
                                       acquaintance of the visit to London, Mr. Lanchester. One of the large

                                       other buildings which are identical in character with Channing College as

                                       domes and minarets play the same part in the landscape around here that
                                       "eggs and darts" play in Renaissance buildings. I struck a couple of

                                       objections to the original site which are grounded on fear that the space
                                       will be needed for future extension of the Laboratories of the science
                                       buildings. I am installed with table in the Physics Building and quite
                                       probably may have to make a change in the design for our building since the
                                       first one is quite unsuitable for the alternative site. Walter

                                       interesting points. At least half the people there were unknown to me. Mrs.
                                       Walker said it was an inspiring evening. Mrs. Lightband, who is inclined to
                                       be antagonistic toward her husband's interest in Anthroposophy, was there
                                       and Miss Drummond told me she said she began to realize there was something
                                       she could learn there, etc. I am to give two more, next Wednesday and the

                                       being quite amazed that it could be so without booze. I supplied the

                                       a group of human beings and they went down under it like ninepins. And then
                                       a cry went up over the death of children as if that was more than could be

                                       hence brickwork in cement mortar is laid and reinforced in the same way as
                                       concrete even to two-way reinforcing of slabs. Brickwork in ordinary houses
                                       is laid in mud. Plastering of walls and roofs has been done for ages of

                                       cost 4 rupees per square foot or less, and this young architect's estimate
                                       for our Library was 7 rupees for both floors together! Bricks are 8 rupees
                                       per thousand delivered. Altogether building costs are not more than one
                                       third Australian costs for equivalent work. The Treasurer of Benares

                                       but whenever my thoughts are free they revert to little Charles. Where will
                                       he find again such a mother perfected in every way, also such playmates, and
                                       such guidance as yours? I can only think from the impression he has left
                                       with me that he may have been so far advanced that he needed only a brief
                                       experience for some purpose of karma. His parents still have another
                                       remarkable individuality in Ivor who will be the recompense for their
                                       sacrifice no doubt but to have to forego, all at once, the joy and
                                       association with Charles cannot but be terrible for them just now. It is
                                       grievous enough for those of us who had little more than the privilege of

                                       education of women. It is affiliated with the University which affords some
                                       of its laboratory facilities to Science students and confers the degrees.
                                       According to the annual report there are 172 students in residence in the
                                       palatial quadrangle which must enclose an area of 15 acres at least.

            <p><a name="d0e1750"></a>The most interesting feature of the program however was the presentation of
                                       Sophocles' Antigone from a platform of the arcaded quadrangle to an audience
                                       under a tent marque or pavilion. The chorus was clothed in robes of steel
                                       blue and white and the only Caucasian (American) was the leading female
                                       character Antigone. Compared with your production of the same play in the
                                       valley theatre the manipulation of the groups was clumsy but the stage
                                       afforded scant opportunity and there had been drastic curtailment of
                                       rehearsals, the original master mind and producer having left the college
                                       for a position elsewhere, and this was the first time anything of this sort
                                       had been attempted.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1753"></a>The choruses however chanted their lines to beautiful and appropriate music,
                                       written in America, but accompanied by a concealed piano which should have
                                       been a harp. The leading characters were successfully rendered though the
                                       young lady who was the King had taken the role in an emergency only eight
                                       days before. I thought the performance of Antigone extremely beautiful and
                                       the lines given to that character are certainly inspiring. Most of what I
                                       have told of the circumstances of this production I learned on the occasion
                                       of my visit to the college the following Tuesday when I talked on
                                       Anthroposophy for 45 minutes from 1 P.M. to a group studying comparative
                                       religions. I shall not soon forget the scene when I turned into the southern
                                       cloister with the girls passing to and fro from their class rooms in their
                                       fresh tinted saris in the morning sunlight, such a scene as could be
                                       imagined only of ancient Greece. One of the Science Doctors with whom I

            <p><a name="d0e1761"></a>each day in the tower of the Chemistry Building, when I enquired about Indian
                                       plays as you requested said that there are as yet none of the Indian plays
                                       done properly into English except Tagore of which (1) Sacrifice, (2)
                                       Waterfall and (3) The Dark Chamber are favorable examples. Probably these
                                       are already available in Sydney. Another of the Chemistry lecturers gave two
                                       public lectures on "Alchemy" this week the first of which dealt,
                                       superficially of course, with the ancient art in India and Europe. The
                                       second however was a very able and lucid exposition of the accomplishments
                                       in England, Germany, France, Italy and America through which, by electrical
                                       disintegration of the nucleus, 41 of the elements have now been transmuted
                                       and astonishingly (astonishing to those not familiar with Anthroposophy)
                                       radio-active forces produced with <u> far greater energy
                                              development than the millions of volts</u> required for the operation.
                                       A radio-active sodium has been achieved with properties equal to radium at
                                       comparatively insignificant cost by Lawrence of California. Thus are the
                                       Anthroposophic statements being confirmed.

                                       Willingdon's term is up. Thousands of pounds are invested in temporary
                                       street arches and illuminations by the politicians and the Raja landlords. I

                                       average yearly earning is one pound sterling per person! Still there does
                                       not seem to be sufficient social intelligence to find the way out any more
                                       than elsewhere in the benighted world. Dr. Steiner's Threefold Commonwealth
                                       idea might get a better hearing here than in the West as this community is
                                       as yet less mechanized.

                                       I am sorry to be missing Dr. Steiner's cycle on the Bhagavad Gita, the
                                       discussions and Miss Drummond's comments thereon. I greatly enjoyed the
                                       rendering you posted me. I like your reports of the activities of the St.
                                       John Group after the Sydney exodus. It may eventuate that that event was the
                                       first necessity. Forming a new group of the West Australians is another of
                                       Miss Drummond's master strokes. Give my felicitations and congratulations to
                                       Bim on his conquest of Roma. I have been rereading some of your newsy
                                       letters before I could part with them for Gene's benefit. It is hard to
                                       realize that so much of vital interest and importance can have happened in
                                       and about Castlecrag in so short a time. Wherever you are however that is
                                       the case.

            <p><a name="d0e1814"></a>We are still unsettled as to the site of the Library though I think the
                                       committee is gradually getting committed to my revised plan for the original
                                       site undoubtedly the better site and a much improved plan. There will be a
                                       grand rush with the working drawings and specifications for which I shall
                                       have the help of a draftsman for we are still planning to complete them and
                                       then travel to Benares, Calcutta, Madras and various points south before the
                                       Moldavia leaves Colombo.

            <p><a name="d0e1817"></a>I have made a new discovery solving the sightseeing problem of Lucknow. I can
                                       rent a bicycle for three pice - 5 cents - per hour. The site is level and
                                       the roads are hard and the exercise is less than that required to drive a
                                       motor car, so I get about whenever I find time by day or by moonlight. The
                                       only disagreeable feature is the dust which is less than by any other
                                       conveyance or even in staying home and that is about the same as in Illinois
                                       in Summer. It should be much worse considering that for nine months it never
                                       rains, but by some dispensation of Providence in this favored peninsula it
                                       is not. Sunday with the landlady's son and another boarder from Calcutta we
                                       did the North West corner of the City which from the point of view of the
                                       Jani Mahid (Mosque) is a perfect Arabian

            <p><a name="d0e1828"></a>This evening I saw the Martiniere College, the building erected by the French
                                       soldier who became a British General after the French had been defeated and
                                       who was offered $5,000,000 for this magnificent creation by the reigning
                                       Nawab at the beginning of the 19th Century. It is in no sense Indian but is
                                       a grander conception than the French palaces of those days of magnificence
                                       of Versailles and Fontainebleau. It is more impressive in composition and is
                                       rich with multitudinous exterior sculptured groups and figures. His
                                       endowment had provided the leading school for Europeans in India, in the
                                       institutions at Lucknow and Calcutta, also an institution of similar scale
                                       at his home town of Lyons. The other endowed schools or privately supported
                                       institutions I have come across are those of the Americans for the Indians
                                       themselves. The Isabella Thoburn College previously mentioned is one of the
                                       three institutions of higher learning that united to form Lucknow
                                       University, the remaining two being of Indian origin supported by
                                       Government.

                                       and quite unsuitable for combination with the suffused flickering glow which

                                       Mahony Griffin. Sorry to hear that Pynor is not fully recovered in health
                                       but surely Australia will be better for his trouble than Europe. As to my
                                       next incarnation I cannot think of anything better in this poor old world
                                       than the job I am now on though I fear the fixed star of my entelechy did
                                       not indicate that. My physical appearance does not suggest much of the
                                       Indian but I have a hunch that much of my architectural predilections must
                                       have come from Indian experience. This does not mean that the environment
                                       here provides satisfaction so much as that it provides stimulus and motifs
                                       for satisfactory imagination. Louis Sullivan found his stimulus in Saracenic
                                       architecture and may have reincarnated from a Moorish experience to give it
                                       adequate expression. His appearance would support such an hypothesis even if
                                       mine does not suggest the Indian.

            <p><a name="d0e1883"></a>could take a holiday from thinking for that length of time. The building
                                       plans do not correspond with the ground plan and the elevations are without
                                       doors or windows, or shades or shadows. With a few of the adjustments of the
                                       machines, that du Pont factory at Elizabeth, New Jersey, could do half the

                                       half. The pattern is pure Roman from Letarouilly ("Edifices de Rome
                                       Moderne"). This scientific architecture was applied to Lucknow without
                                       reference to the world or the sun or the air above nor the water beneath the
                                       earth, recking <a name="53"></a> [Note: i.e., taking into account] not of man nor his
                                       works, his knowledge, nor resources. Nothing but the "idees fixes" in his
                                       authoritative Ego were granted admission. He was here in the cold season
                                       which is why (I am told by Prof. McMahon) there is no consideration of the
                                       hot sun in summer and thus the buildings are squares mostly on the
                                       diagonals, inappropriate for this hot climate, or circuses such as we use
                                       for sunbathing because they both afford no shade in the middle of the day.

                                       established nor yet where the Academic Departments were in operation,
                                       several miles to the East, both in elaborate housing, nor yet where there

                                       North and South traffic and also astride the river withal destroying one
                                       bridge for one purpose and submitting another for only a University
                                       connection. He was here in the dry season so he chose a site of low level
                                       which was altogether under 21 feet of water at the next periodic flood of
                                       1923. The conditions in Lucknow are on all fours with Canberra. The river is
                                       dammed to a certain extent so that it can be used for boating, and
                                       especially for domestic laundry purposes in this country as in France. But
                                       it is not dammed sufficiently to provide an impounded area such as is
                                       required for a flood so there are large valley areas subject to occasional
                                       inundation and unsuitable for civic utilization. You may recall that most of

                                       design, was surmounted in a meeting, almost unanimous, yesterday afternoon
                                       after a satisfactory interview thereon with the Vice Chancellor who is the
                                       resident head, the Chancellor being the Governor of the Province, Sir Harry
                                       Haig. The next vital hurdle will be the engineer of the Province who is
                                       expected back from a trip Saturday next. He can approve or disapprove or
                                       order amendments under the delightful system of checks and balances of
                                       Parliamentary Governmental form. After him the Executive Council called by
                                       the Vice Chancellor for the 16th instant and then the Building Committee. It
                                       is hoped to be ready to lay a foundation stone in February and complete the
                                       building for one and a half lakhs in the course of a year thereafter. The
                                       Librarian expressed concern that I did not intend to supervise the erection.
                                       Possibly he may want me back sometime or other in the construction stage in
                                       connection with the ornamentation but when he counts the cost he is bound to

                                       concerned with architecture in terms of symmetry and ornament and will not
                                       readily subserve these features to mere dollars and cents. This works for a
                                       consistent vogue to be sure but, as is becoming apparent, that vogue is not
                                       necessarily reactionary. Particularly however it is not likely to become
                                       purely mechanical and in that is the possibility of creating a demand for
                                       our work if we were to establish a permanent office of European character
                                       for an Indian clientele. But that would mean living here on the part of one
                                       or the other of us. I shall not be in a position to judge better of this
                                       prospect until after some experience in Calcutta which is the center of
                                       modern India as well as the 2nd city of the British Empire if not as thickly
                                       populated with practicing architects as some others. Hold on to Father until
                                       I come. Merry Christmas when it comes and a successful play in the valley.

                                       lonesome place now and for a long time and will be the same tenfold for the
                                       little wife and child of Ronald Craig after what has happened today. Last
                                       night we were discussing my Sunday luncheon with the editor of "The Pioneer"
                                       which Mr. Craig had been deterred from attending, also our trivial matters
                                       of business and the happenings of the last three days that had passed since
                                       I was with him Thursday. This afternoon I helped lower his coffin into the
                                       grave in the beautiful

            <p><a name="d0e1955"></a>cemetery over the River to the North of the City. For me the blows were in
                                       rapid succession, first the news yesterday noon that he was ill at the King
                                       George Hospital, trouble undiagnosed, but an operation; second the sight of
                                       him in the private ward all livid red and with blood-shot eyes yet withal
                                       cheerful, thoughtful and practical in the waking periods from the morphine
                                       injections found necessary to make his excruciating agony sufferable. He
                                       said his trouble was an inflammation of liver and gall bladder, his nurse
                                       gave a somewhat more indefinite account and the house surgeon insisting on
                                       the need of immediate operation admitted to me that they would have to wait
                                       until they had cut into the abdomen to find out which organ needed the
                                       operation.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1958"></a>Not being able to reconcile the diagnosis with the remedy I went with Mr.
                                       Alagappan and the Craig's next door neighbor who is the University Treasurer
                                       to the house of the surgeon in charge to find out if nothing more could be
                                       done in the diagnosis, suggesting consulting physician, X-ray, in addition
                                       to blood and urine tests already made. He said that relief was so urgent all
                                       medicines having failed and the continuing with morphine being so
                                       undesirable, that it was not a case for a physician but for surgery and
                                       unless the pain was reduced by the time of the next consciousness at six, he
                                       would have to operate. Shortly after this we all went into the ward with the
                                       surgeon who asked Mr. Craig about a certain sore spot on his arm, which was
                                       a new development. He thereupon said it was no longer a question of
                                       immediate operation but of calling in a physician which he did and we left
                                       them in consultation in order to hunt for a private nurse for continuous
                                       attendance. Under the latter circumstances Mrs. Craig was finally induced to
                                       leave the patient with great reluctance. I only found thereafter that Mr.
                                       Alagappan's insistence was based on a suspicion of smallpox which the
                                       physician confirmed at 8 o'clock declaring the case to be homeroidal [sic]
                                       or suppressed smallpox which is said to be

            <p><a name="d0e1990"></a>I was the first to whom this news was transmitted when Mr. Alagappan called
                                       this morning to report that the death ensued at 12:15 this morning relieving
                                       terrible agony and a fit of delirium. Earlier he had cried out in total
                                       blindness for the lights to be turned on as how otherwise could he see his
                                       baby. Yet two electric lights were glaring over his bed. The little wife has
                                       been brave, almost stoical. Tomorrow the mother and child whom I had
                                       expected to know so well leave for her father's home in Madras. Her
                                       brilliant schoolmate, the History teacher in the Isabella Thoburn College,
                                       has offered to travel with her tomorrow afternoon away from the Lucknow of
                                       painful associations.

            <p><a name="d0e1993"></a>We have all lost a friend whose only fault was a great carelessness of his
                                       own life and who bore his troubles with such fortitude that even those
                                       around hardly suspected that there were any such things. He valued humanity
                                       so much that he may have underrated the constituent element, the individual
                                       Ego, and in his own case I feel sure that he carried this too far. Mr.
                                       Alagappan has said many times that his capacities would make him a wealthy
                                       man in two years if he would apply them to the contracting business which,
                                       however, did not sufficiently engage his interest. Seemingly there are many
                                       openings for imaginative enterprise here where new education is only
                                       starting new demands. My sympathy goes to you for your loss of a far
                                       longerstanding friendship. His last words were of his mother who he said
                                       would be here now if he had let her know of his previous illness but under
                                       the circumstances it was he thought perhaps as well that he had not let her
                                       know. You will have heard the terrible fact of his loss by the cable sent
                                       her today. Admittedly confluential smallpox baffles diagnosis. One of the
                                       Physics staff told us this morning of the only case he knew of, that of a
                                       young son of a Maharaja who brought the most eminent physicians of Bombay,
                                       Delhi and two from Calcutta, giving their names, all of whom acknowledged

                                           <a name="56"></a> [Note: Samuel Hahnemann?] who immediately named the disease and
                                       prescribed two doses which immediately brought the eruptions to the surface
                                       allowing the natural development to take place leading to recovery. It is
                                       this that is unrecognized by the Allopathic School. I am glad therefore that
                                       the Craigs exhausted the possibilities of Homeopathy available in the first
                                       instance though the individual physician was unable within the limited time
                                       to hit upon the real cause. As to what I might say to Ronald Craig's mother
                                       when in Sydney the little mother said, "Tell her to come sometime to see the
                                       child." His affection for his mother and solicitude for his family occupied
                                       his mind. For himself he said he was happy and finally he had ten minutes of
                                       peace and quiet after his violent delirium and died with a smile on his
                                       face. Sincerely, Walter Burley Griffin

                                       What a harvest this great reaper is gathering from the fields we are in.
                                       There must be something stirring on the other side just now, and these
                                       fields are productive. The death of Ronald Craig cuts to the quick. We had
                                       planned to live near each other adjoining the University under more flexible
                                       and economic as well as more social conditions than has been possible for
                                       either. There is always smallpox during the specific seasons of the
                                       different sections of India each year and in the north its season is the
                                       winter. For example there may be fifty cases in Lucknow now which are as a
                                       rule under segregation and are not regarded as anything more serious than
                                       most diseases.

            <p><a name="d0e2010"></a>Though Mr. Craig had not done much during the period of finding a home, he
                                       had previously started and undertaken to complete a considerable course of
                                       Steiner's works which might have graduated him from Krishnamurti (Vedanta)

                                       A still week has passed since the swift tragedy of Ronald Craig, and five
                                       days since I said goodbye to the sad-visaged widow and bright-faced infant
                                       in the train bound for South India. In anticipation of an excursion next
                                       week I have reloaded my camera. The excursion if it comes off is to a
                                       Mohammadan wedding to which Mr. Alagappan and I are invited at Peshawar of
                                       all places the most unlikely one for me to see in India;- beyond Baluchistan
                                       in the North West frontier Province, at the Khyber pass: The frontier is
                                       seven hundred miles away. The route traverses also Amritsar of the Golden
                                       Temple and Taxila the vast city of disinterred foundations in successive
                                       layers to 3,000 years ago and whose King Taxilles was Alexander's ally

            <p><a name="d0e2056"></a>Nothing has eventuated from my luncheon with the "Pioneer" editor, Mr. Young,
                                       but my Indian doctor at the University dispensary, who has been dressing a
                                       sore knuckle where I slid on it cycling, says that three wasteful social
                                       engagements on each side must precede any business undertaking in India as
                                       in Europe until the prevalence of rascality is reduced! This M.D. is a
                                       sterling type who says from his experience that 90% of the Christian
                                       Missionaries of which the Americans are the disinterested example have their
                                       individual welfare first at heart though the other one tenth are superb. But
                                       everyone has a missionary job with one person that is himself. The Bible
                                       contains certain precepts which applied would solve all the world's problems
                                       but to apply them is the only effective way to promulgate them and the
                                       examples are very, very wanting. This is only a rough paraphrase of his
                                       homely sentiment. Like the French in so many ways, these Hindus speak rapid
                                       fire even in English and are hard to keep up with. But unlike some of the
                                       students who buttonholed me to talk when photographing Harcourt Hotel this
                                       morning, the little old doctor speaks from long and hard experience. The
                                       students had with reason arrived at politics - Fascism, Communism and
                                       Non-co-operation severally but were not unreceptive of what I thought

                                       injustice I must say that they have provided the foundation for a large, if
                                       not the largest part, of the modern education of these parts which is the
                                       first need of India, wherever it may lead to. They make no requirement of
                                       conversion nor affiliation nor commitment of any sort but have afforded the
                                       facilities of splendid institutions to all alike without inquiry. Needless
                                       to say, the result of these good works may not be the Christianizing of the
                                       heathens for which the contributions were exacted in Boston and Chicago. As

                                       factors in the Lucknow University and affords all the facilities for the
                                       women, so is the Christian College named after its first master, whose name

                                       Griffin - What shocking, what dreadful word has come to us from India, the
                                       death of Ronald Craig. Truly December was, in our circle, the terrible month
                                       the astrologers have been telling us it would be. His letters to Mrs.
                                       Maddocks have been most fascinating, delightful, quaint and appreciative. It
                                       is hard indeed to accept these blows. As for the suggestion in your last of
                                       the possibility of establishing a permanent office in India, my advice would
                                       be to do it if there was a straw of a possibility of a practice there. You
                                       could be back here for a month or two each year and I am satisfied to remain
                                       here if it is necessary. This would remain your residence. Apparently your
                                       period which Mr. Meebold says is important for us to learn, suggests that,
                                       however little personal advantage there might be in it, and neither you nor
                                       I are interested in that side, you are due for a change:- 21 landscape

                                       very sweetly. The lawn border very gay. Miss Leeson makes it her Sunday task
                                       to behead the calliopsis, and the poker plant is out, and gladioli. Mr.

                                       entirely Anthro Audience with Miss Mitchell here. Evening, Miss Drummond, a
                                       wonderful talk on a Christmas thought, followed by general carol singing.
                                       Sunday Miss Birch showed great capacity for lecturing in a talk on Christ
                                       and the Ego. We are looking on these Festivals as a sort of normal school
                                       for training Anthro lecturers for Miss Drummond to use as she thinks fit.
                                       She gave a lecture a week ago at Kings Hall, the biggest audience they have
                                       had in some time. This Theosophical group is not under bondage to the Adyar

                                       Christ event so she was very pleased when two of their higher-ups came over
                                       to see her the following day to discuss what was the difference between them
                                       and us. She stated it as the emphasis on the nature of the Christ. They
                                       asked that we give further lectures and she suggested me for the Four
                                       Ethers, Warmth, Light, Sound, Magnetism and Mr. Herbert for Man and Animal
                                       and they are putting us on their announced program for the year, each of us
                                       for two. She had a wonderful letter from Mrs. Growcott stating in detail the
                                       marked increase in interest and activity in the Melbourne group, as if they
                                       had sort of come to life.

                                       and two Angels with wings. In each group an Angel set off a Roman candle.
                                       The topmost group on a rocky promontory was silhouetted against the sky, the
                                       star of Bethlehem above their heads shining through the branches of a great
                                       gum tree. Gradually during the play they moved down the hill taking
                                       formations as they came down till they all grouped on top of wall and then
                                       down the double flight of steps. The cherubs clustered around Mary. The
                                       speech chorus who had first spoken from the East Valley crest and then from
                                       top of wall, knelt in the low valley below the Madonna, Kings and shepherd
                                       group, each with a candle lighted by the five boys, the acolytes, who had
                                       previously set off the Roman candles for the Angel Gabriel.

            <p><a name="d0e2148"></a>The only real faux pas was the shepherds coming in the 2nd scene instead of
                                       the third. I had to let them practically come to a conclusion so as not to
                                       mess it and then had to creep down behind the bushes and make them come off,
                                       and had to hustle on the speech chorus and Mary and the cherubs in the
                                       Annunciation scene and then made the shepherds go on from another entrance
                                       and do their whole scene again as their lines gave all the cues for the
                                       Heavenly Hosts on the hill which included flute solo and violin. If it had
                                       been anywhere but that enchanted valley it would have made an unholy mess
                                       but as it was it was hardly noticed by the audience though one man's
                                       criticism was <u>a certain lack of co-ordination</u>!!! Hope the

                                       really dress rehearsal. The girls were all enchantingly lovely. Everyone
                                       spoke of Mrs. Walker's loveliness when as an Angel on the heights she played
                                       the flute. It was a brilliant scene for they were all in color except the 5
                                       cherubs who were in white as was Mary in the annunciation scene - Mrs.
                                       Prescott, Mary. Next time it will be Mrs. Nicholls who too has been lovely
                                       in rehearsals. There was a fine audience, Miss Leeson, the august librarian
                                       of Australia's History Library, taking the shilling entrance fees if that
                                       term can be used where there is no entrance.

                                       few Europeans here but the Indians have been most hospitable and pleasant to
                                       know and the environment is a great relief to live in because without being

                                       Australia and in America except where nature is free from man. In the

                                       or "chauks" which are crossed in crowded and often narrow and winding roads
                                       fed by narrower lanes where the bulk of the people live of course. On the
                                       other hand the bulk of the city is given over to residences that are
                                       "palatial" in character surrounded with luxurious gardens. The University
                                       occupies such a garden with some of the Arch Gates and sections of the old
                                       wall still standing. It was a garden famous for its mangos and the old
                                       stately trees are the main basis of the embellishment of the Campus and
                                       quadrangles. Marion tells me she is sending copies of my letters on to you.

            <p><a name="d0e2203"></a>I am comfortable here and find endless source of interest in the environment
                                       of an ancient civilization. More so too than one could have had said 20
                                       years ago when everything in the East was stationary. It is not so for the
                                       future and the prospect of fruitful activity is perhaps not less than in the
                                       new countries of America and Australia which used to be in such contrast
                                       with conservative European ways but which, unfortunately, have been coming
                                       to adopt them more and more. One of the difficulties here which makes for
                                       monopoly of opportunity now is that the standard of rascality set in the
                                       highest places has put all enterprise under suspicion and business goes by
                                       favor to those whose social position is established so well that they are
                                       willingly highly paid for safety from fraud. Interest is fabulously high for
                                       enterprise because of the insurance factor against being swindled
                                       altogether. The Indians have been so adept in applying the tricks they have
                                       seen worked so successfully by Europeans that it is particularly difficult
                                       for one of them to gain the confidence of his fellows as yet and so,
                                       professionally, the work goes to one or the other of the more conspicuous
                                       foreigners whose reputation for trustworthiness has not been forfeited and
                                       these are few indeed. My builder client, Mr. Alagappan who was for a long
                                       time the responsible officer of the British Construction Co. and whose
                                       wide-spreading work is the result of his known integrity says however that
                                       without the prestige of a foreign reputation he cannot carry conviction to
                                       his clients who are always expecting to be bluffed in technical matters.

                                       served. Take-down is the accepted principle with the servitor classes with

                                       amongst these. Yet a tonga walla (sulky car driver) in my experience with
                                       one or two exceptions returns my money tendered as the legal fare posted in

                                       for. Yet that does not make him in any way the less anxious to carry you the

                                       worst victims, and an acquaintance here once saw one pay a golden sovereign
                                       for a peacock tail fan, marked value then as now three cents, at the Lucknow

                                       Lucknow was the hottest point in India last summer and it is often the
                                       coldest. I sleep under two blankets and an eiderdown comfort at elevation

                                           <a name="66"></a> [Note: Jahangirabad?] I have been requested to make an appointment

                                       $100,000 building result according to Australian standards.

                                       - I gave up the trip to Peshawar because Mr. Alagappan is ill with a fever
                                       in Benares. Even here, where there is such a considerable English
                                       sprinkling, the servants of these Europeans cannot speak their employer's
                                       language and so Hindustani is the connecting link with them as well as
                                       between the various peoples of India generally. Between our Christmas
                                       holidays there occurred after Friday night the Mohammedan breaking of the
                                       annual month's fast concurrently with the National Congress Diamond Jubilee
                                       Day. The streets were filled with brilliant silks and satins and men and
                                       women and children who foregathered in a section, Aishbagh, which is their
                                       customary center for this particular festival. Evidently it is a picnic
                                       feast but, like all the goings on here in public, without any sign of
                                       organized amusement and without any hilarity or noise or confusion. I only
                                       skirted the throng taking the occasion to cycle through Old Lucknow, the
                                       Northwest section, where the picturesque narrow lanes were almost deserted.
                                       Evidently strong drink offers no temptation to the Indians for I have seen
                                       no sign of its sale or use or consequences anywhere as yet. Yesterday two
                                       gaily attired fellows were causing much congestion in the street by their
                                       conviviality with arms around each others necks and boisterousness but not
                                       rowdiness. From their feature characteristics, pointed out to me in examples
                                       previously by Mr. Craig, I recognized them as unmistakable Nepalese,
                                       predominantly Mongolian, from the adjoining inaccessible independent nation.

                                       of animals large and small, pack animals, asses and cattle and occasional
                                       camels, and strings of massive wagons and carts drawn by oxen or buffaloes
                                       wobbling from side to side with the drivers, more frequently than not, fast
                                       asleep. Cycling in and around the town on roads, which at this season, are
                                       everywhere adapted for the purpose, circumvents all these obstacles and, at
                                       the moderate speed imposed, employs a minimum effort. For me anyway, perhaps
                                       because of boyhood training of the muscles, the wheel is a magic carpet
                                       under which the earth just rolls away in the opposite direction. I have not
                                       priced wheels, which I notice are even sold on installments here, because
                                       their rental is so cheap, but a Japanese machine such as I often ride and
                                       which is good for two years at least costs in Calcutta from 15 to 18
                                       rupees!! This is perhaps the cause of the absence of tramways here.

            <p><a name="d0e2257"></a>I got real satisfaction out of the American light opera "Naughty Marietta" of

                                       understand they are planning to go into the production of Hindu drama for
                                       native consumption. Think what a magnificent field in religious mystery and
                                       mythology and music such conscientious production as theirs could open up!
                                       There are three talkies in Lucknow given up to presenting species of local
                                       production of successions of stilted and actionless dialogue.

                                       Germany, first under foreign yoke then under equally ferocious domestic
                                       tyranny. My new draftsman, <a name="69"></a> [Note: name erased] who has had only
                                       engineering drawing experience with a Railroad and has never used a Tee
                                       square, is making a conscientious start with admirable pains and promises
                                       better speed with the help of the parallel rule that Mr. Alagappan borrowed
                                       for him today. Deputizing some of the tracing has enabled me to clear up
                                       some of the lesser jobs that have been pending including some alterations
                                       for University buildings they have asked for. Servants are not a

                                       Europeans. It is customary for servants to pad prices, thus my landlady
                                       tells of a case where a nobleman made his cook a handsome monthly allowance
                                       on condition that he forego this practice. After a month's trial this
                                       servant handed back the allowance saying that he did better the old way! On
                                       two occasions I entrusted letters to be posted by Mr. Alagappan's "munshi"
                                       but as yet I do not know whether he did so or soaked off the stamps for
                                       himself. I found afterwards that Mr. Alagappan would not go so far as to
                                       trust him with stamped letters.

                                       tuberculosis and leprosy are rife amongst them attributed to their long
                                       continued exclusive intermarriage. This is the other side of the eugenistic
                                       case in which the Persian Sect constitutes the outstanding example of
                                       cultural advancement through selection.

                                       not have studied "The Threefold Commonwealth" at these places also and so
                                       have found their bearings for the new educational and political course on
                                       which they have just embarked. I am loath to part with your letters in a

                                       Griffin. Tuesday and Thursday evenings I went with Miss Drummond, who is
                                       working with the Australian broadcasters in the production of the operas,
                                       arranging connecting links where they have to be cut to fit the time
                                       requirements, to the broadcasting station where d'Abravanel, who it seems is
                                       a young Portuguese Jew, was conducting the opera Rosenkavalier of Strauss
                                       for the Radio. Miss Drummond heard the first production of the opera in
                                       Germany with Strauss himself conducting and, as she said, all the conductors
                                       in the world in the audience. Apart from the work itself which was I should
                                       say a remarkable and sustained play upon the emotions, I was immensely
                                       interested in how things are done in such a piece of broadcasting. The half
                                       hour preceding made you feel you understood the effectiveness of Chinese
                                       music. Most of the members of the orchestra were busy severally practicing
                                       for their lives the hard parts of their scores, no one paying the slightest
                                       attention to what anyone else was playing. It gave a feeling of intense
                                       excitement.

                                       of the Australian singers were going for their lives into the microphones
                                       against the noisiest orchestra you ever heard. It would have been
                                       interesting to be able to hear it at the same time over the air but
                                       doubtless it sounded quite usual there.

            <p><a name="d0e2349"></a>I think I have come to an understanding of this love business. We learn from
                                       Steiner that the soul longs for the spirit, our own soul longs for union
                                       with our own spirit. With no direct knowledge of this nor conscious contact
                                       with the spirit we interpret that as the urge for our human mate, and the
                                       search begins and disappointment comes for the unsatisfied longing
                                       continues, but finally when we are driven to the spiritual for refuge, if we
                                       have developed ourselves sufficiently, we find our spirit, our Ego, and the
                                       soul becomes united with the spirit. When we have done that we have indeed
                                       changed our temperament for that is the balancing of the four ethers and

                                       on the type of over-acidulate regimen that we share here though she has said
                                       that if I stayed long enough she would have to become a vegetarian. However
                                       she has been going some seventeen years longer than I have as it is. She is
                                       somewhat of the type but on the whole much hardier seeming than my

            <p><a name="d0e2371"></a>An article in one of the papers has put the case that Hollywood is doing more
                                       for the awakening of India than the British ever could. Certainly such an
                                       artistic presentation of all phases of human civilization cannot but arouse
                                       a growing interest in things outside themselves that these so subjectively
                                       disposed peoples need if they are ever to change at all. As it is the
                                       Brahmin head Vice Chancellor of the University is quoted in the paper
                                       advising all Indians to relegate their religion to the background as the
                                       only means of reconciling their differences and caste distinctions which he
                                       abhors but can fight only with contempt as we advocate for politics. Walter

            <p><a name="d0e2374"></a>23 January 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                                       One of the popular illusions about India is that it is vegetarian,
                                       apparently by failing to take into account the insignificant proportion of
                                       higher castes. In the North here the meat consumption must be equivalent
                                       with other places of similar economic state. Another illusion is that time
                                       doesn't matter much because the incidence of the matters concerned happens
                                       to be different from some other places. The Puja of the Brahmins, the
                                       exacting schedule of the Pardes and the five daily devotions of the Muslims
                                       must keep a live consciousness of time as good as that of the American
                                       hustler. So far in my affairs I have found as little leniency in this as in
                                       Sydney at any rate. Possibly the reduction in proportion of alien exploiters
                                       is changing the condition. Though my draftsmen's hours are 10 to 4, there is
                                       no stopping for lunch nor is there any reduction Saturday nor Sunday. In
                                       fact, though Civil Station shops are closed and the church bells ring, there
                                       is little difference between Sunday and the other days amongst the populace.
                                       The hawkers start calling before daybreak and continue well into the dark.
                                       Just the same also with building operations with women as well as men
                                       carrying on construction with lanterns to eke out more wages at the 8 hour
                                       day time rate. The real difference of course is in the repeat of the wheel
                                       of time as against the spiral concept of evolution of the West.

                                       while to start my work. My first view of the site was last Saturday
                                       afternoon when the arrangement of the floor plan was discussed at length,
                                       the dimensions being a question of inches almost because he is removing
                                       parts of other buildings to make a courtyard frontage available. Naturally
                                       some of these arrangements have had to be upset as the result of further
                                       study here of stairways, etc. and the whole question of exterior is being
                                       settled, I hope, without consultation with the owner, pending our breakfast

            <p><a name="d0e2409"></a>Jahangirabad lies some thirty miles north of Lucknow and it was a fresh
                                       sensation when we were taken out there by the car sent for us Saturday. As
                                       with the Moguls themselves the chief sport of this landlord is pulling down,
                                       rebuilding and extending his palace buildings and gardens. The proprietor
                                       showed us through his main house in addition to the section we are
                                       immediately concerned with. The rooms were vast as he inherited them but he
                                       has been throwing them together to make them vaster still in his time. The
                                       only architectural feature of special interest however was a Paridari or
                                       garden pavilion which I was much taken with when we were escorted through
                                       the gardens by his overseer and his gardener. This fact made a hit with the
                                       chief when we got back to tea and found that it was all his work unassisted
                                       and I told him that architects were superfluous in his case. Because he is
                                       unable to draw he must have had some real assistance in modeling the
                                       exquisite plaques, all different, on the interior walls but that he has a
                                       developed aesthetic sense is evident from his garden as well as from some
                                       chance observations on the state of architecture in America.

            <p><a name="d0e2450"></a>Friday afternoon was the occasion of the lawn reception at the Ghulan Hasan
                                       home in Lucknow the Begam Hasan's brother and his bride from Peshawar. The
                                       catering was European style but there was no governor there nor any
                                       considerable proportion of Europeans but it was an occasion to see the elite
                                       of Lucknow, cloth of gold in rich embroidery was characteristic of many of
                                       the men's costumes including turban, and of course of the groom's. The saris
                                       of many of the women were the most attractive feature, in fine fabrics and
                                       rich coloring, one with bands of black and red and gold being especially
                                       striking. The bride was precisely the living Persian painting that we have
                                       seen reproduced in books of Eastern art. She was petite with finely modeled
                                       features, almost fair complexion, with a richly embroidered lace
                                       architectural head-dress and salmon and Naples yellow tinted gown. I took
                                       special note of this much for the purpose of this correspondence but my
                                       ignorance of the technical terms prevents my transmitting further details.
                                       The effect however was exquisite altogether and suited to the demure
                                       attitude such as one would expect from a lifetime of purdah.

                                       and was a Major in the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917 in France. He
                                       is now teaching physical education in one of the colleges in Lucknow
                                       supported by American missions where he is handicapped by his poor knowledge
                                       of Hindustani. It seems that he went to America at the age of six with his
                                       parents who were completing their education there. When they returned to
                                       India he was fourteen and elected to stay in U.S.A. earning his own way. He
                                       found no difficulty there due to race or color and succeeded and only came
                                       back to India because the British queried his citizenship qualifications for
                                       the American army and, for reasons I did not quite follow, induced him to
                                       leave. He attributes any color disability that people such as the Indians
                                       find, or before the war found, in America to their own inferiority complex
                                       or diffidence. However it has taken him so long to accustom himself to India
                                       that he would not advise others to gain their education abroad until they
                                       had become thoroughly grounded at home.

            <p><a name="d0e2464"></a>An Anglo-Indian engineer of the Irrigation Department came in yesterday to
                                       get advice on the completion of his extensive home opposite Government
                                       House. He also left particulars of another house for sketches and broached a
                                       large business block which he had already planned for the business center of
                                       Lucknow. I shall go into these matters with him later. This week I was
                                       pressed to prepare a grounds plan for the University Library which I did
                                       including the plantings, some fifty species of the brightest things in the
                                       way of trees especially that I have seen in India so far. The phenology may
                                       be all off as I have not studied the cultural conditions or special soil
                                       requirements but most of my observed specimens were old and thoroughly
                                       established beyond cultural stages and mixed together in the Gardens at
                                       Perydenia and Lucknow or in the wild. The language difficulty which is a
                                       handicap with the draftsman is also evident with the typist to whom I am
                                       dictating the specifications which are a test for most anybody. Walter

            <p><a name="d0e2472"></a>30 January, 1936, - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin
                                       - Last Saturday I was transplanted back into the time of the real journeyman
                                       architect. On Friday the Raja called here to see that everything was in
                                       readiness, which was far from the fact, and to take me around to see an
                                       attractive arch at the Medical College for consideration in connection with
                                       the new entrance to this Zenana Court and to point out turrets on different
                                       palaces as alternatives to the minarets I had contrived for him which looked
                                       too much like a mosque. When I had completed in pencil the plans, elevations
                                       and section by Saturday morning Mr. Alagappan immediately pointed out that
                                       they did not look like any other palace and set about suggesting
                                       alternatives to propose in meeting that objection. But when we reached
                                       Jahangirabad the Raja said "How beautiful; this is something entirely new,"
                                       and to Mr. Alagappan only "Can you build it?" So that was all the argument
                                       there was on his part and he called in all his retinue one after the other
                                       to admire - which they did, of course, enthusiastically though the outlines
                                       on tracing cloth were indistinct and rather indefinite.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2475"></a>So I completed the foundation plan then and there encountering the first
                                       distinctly Indian difficulty in the fact that the dimensions of the rooms
                                       arrived at according to my module were not all in even feet. I had not
                                       realized that this was important though previously all the witness line
                                       figures had been taken off the University Library plans and the room sizes
                                       indicated somewhat arbitrarily. Mr. Alagappan was upset when the veranda
                                       proved to be 13 feet instead of 12 feet and the drawing room 29 instead 30
                                       feet! It seems the odd numbers would bring bad luck. The Raja said he would
                                       leave this matter to me when I pointed out that the stairs and outlook would
                                       be adversely affected by changing but under the circumstance that the
                                       building interpenetrated two others I was able to switch the wall with a
                                       clear conscience and relieve the misgivings of both parties. Naturally
                                       future occasions may not be so simple but I think a little subterfuge may be
                                       justified.

            <p><a name="d0e2496"></a>However I was able to supply the mistri (overseer) that we had taken with us
                                       with a figured foundation plan before lunch after which I was astonished to
                                       find all the trenches for every room accurately set out with lime lines
                                       checked by cross diagonal measurements to the nearest half inch awaiting our
                                       approval. Then 50 men were set to incising all these lines and embedding
                                       brickwork corner and bench marks and soon after all the trenches were under
                                       way full blast with another 50 on-lookers when the cocoanut sweets were
                                       distributed to all as is the custom in starting works. Meantime the Ruler
                                       had set up his huge red umbrellas, with tables and chairs for us around him,
                                       in various positions of vantage, to discuss the next problem, of the
                                       motor-car entrance-way. After discussing, with Mr. Alagappan in Urdu, my
                                       suggestions for the locating of the stairs and the successive arches and
                                       screens, he exclaimed, "Mr. Griffin is a real architect; this arrangement
                                       will create a perspective effect!" And so what I say goes with him and I am
                                       his white haired boy up to the present.

                                       already, during Sunday, the trenching had been completed and the concreting
                                       started! While we were there he suddenly decided to have us do a European
                                       kitchen for which a space was created by demolishing further ancient
                                       buildings forthwith. Aristocracy has much to commend it not the least of
                                       which is the will and the power to make decisions. How different from the
                                       fear of criticism, the subservience, the rationalization and inhibitions and
                                       paralysis that characterizes the sordid modern world and which are invading
                                       India even, as exemplified in the protracted discussions of the University
                                       Library (a government institution). However though the dependence on reason
                                       has already arrived here the reason at least is relatively unprejudiced
                                       still, and in my little experience I have yet to encounter the determination
                                       not to be convinced.

                                       gave me several similar publications of the Wild-Life Preservation Society
                                       of India on which he indorsed his name as President. His predilection for
                                       his library building at Mamudhabad is ancient Grecian with wide colonnaded
                                       entrance front and an open court with peristyle complete. Hence he showed
                                       particular appreciation of my Melbourne Palais de Dance photographs amongst
                                       those I showed him and also of the setting for Iphigeneia in Tauris with
                                       which he is very familiar though he is only in his early twenties. For that
                                       age a leaning toward Greece should be a good sign I should say. Though we
                                       set no appointment for a visit to his palace I have heard, through my
                                       introducer since, that he was favorably impressed with our work though at
                                       this time the University Library plans were not at hand to show him
                                       unfortunately. Mr. Young says that a word from the Raja of Jahangirabad will
                                       have much influence with him for though he is of insignificant income as
                                       compared with Mamudhabad the former has an influential standing as a man of
                                       shrewdness as well as of taste. Incidentally he is chairman of the Pioneer
                                       newspaper, President of the British India Society, etc. etc. To me he is the
                                       Yankee Sultan or the Oriental Yankee as I told him with reason. I also
                                       advised him that if his chef wanted a job I could recommend him to the

                                       Burley Griffin<br> Dear Mr. Griffin, I met your father. I like him very
                                       much. He was so gay and gallant. He took me to task for placing a chair for
                                       him and later handing him his cane. "Treating me as an old man," he
                                       exclaimed with much indignation covering a merry twinkle. Mrs. Griffin told
                                       him about my wanting the Craig boy. His comment wittily and flatteringly
                                       suggested that there were other ways of solving the problem of an only child
                                       than by bringing up another woman's. We spoke of you. He said that if you
                                       had stayed on in the U.S.A. you would have been the first architect in New

                                       dear Walter Burley, Thank you for an air-mail letter written in the midst of
                                       strenuous work. I had further particulars from Mrs. Griffin of work you are
                                       undertaking in India. Of course I am delighted, but - there is no mention of
                                       your home-coming. You've been away ages! I have a hunch that Ernest Wood may
                                       know of wealthy Indians who would be eager to have you when they know of
                                       your presence in India. Did you post him a card to Adyar? I had a letter
                                       from Komalam too last week. One sentence I'll quote. "I should very much
                                       like to go to Australia for three months and return. If Anna (Mr. Craig's
                                       mother) can look after Baby I can go to London and finish my training so as
                                       to be employed permanently somewhere. I am afraid of the future." She has
                                       her degree of B.S. in Economics from Madras University but feels that a M.A.
                                       from outside would make all the difference in getting an appointment. (She
                                       later took that degree in the Sydney University.) I have replied with the
                                       offer to mind him (Arjuna) for as long as she needs to finish her course.

                                       them my own baby is thoroughly healthy and is as happy as the day is long.
                                       While I am at home and occupied with one I could so easily deal with two.
                                       Edgar is a generous darling. He is quite willing that I should do as I feel
                                       inclined in these matters. Arjuna is one year old today and Deirdre is two.
                                       A year is a convenient interval between babies. They each have the benefit
                                       of the companionship. It is almost impossible to make up for this in the
                                       case of an only child. Last Sunday was Ross Duncan's three year old party

                                       coy and begins with shy advances to brown bread slices with hundreds and
                                       thousands, but with accelerating speed she deals with popcorns and jellies
                                       and after an orange drink or two is at the stage of mounting her chair in
                                       order to get a better view of what is to be had from the table. When it is
                                       time to go home she is tearing about with not an inhibition left and has to
                                       be caught and carried off. After dark she was found in pyjamas and slippers
                                       wandering about the Duncan lawn (next door) like a ghost haunting the scene
                                       of the afternoon festivities.

                                       After supper I got involved in a profound discussion with Tom Godfrey with
                                       the result that I tip-toed home at 2 A.M. He is never rude to me as I have

                                       fairies. But in spite of fairies we are quite good friends. Pearl Bault and
                                       Sheila are with me. She says "It is good to be at Castlecrag when you are in
                                       trouble. There is healing in this patch of earth." Harold Morton said of

                                       action once she has made up her mind. The swiftness of Ron's illness and
                                       death is so like other critical events in his life (his marriage, his

                                       You can be content that you have not been on this trip heretofore because
                                       there would be no escape for you from going back to drafting. Nor have I
                                       found any effective alternative for either of us for that seems to be the
                                       thing that needs doing here now, and it is somewhat hard to account for
                                       where there is such a superfluity of qualified labor in almost every field.
                                       If the Ahmedabad project comes to anything it will be worthy of the
                                       architectural traditions of boldness, taste and skill that constituted basis
                                       of that town (then larger than London) "the most beautiful city in the
                                       world" five centuries ago.

                                       March-Laughton interpretation that I missed in Sydney, a much more forceful
                                       and telling one than possible on the silent screen. What is astounding about
                                       such plays with a purpose is that they can be so popular without apparently
                                       affecting men's thoughts or behavior. Perhaps the appearances are a little
                                       deceptive, but the adventure of giving is hardly given credence anywhere in
                                       Christendom since the case of Huge's <a name="74"></a> [Note: Victor Hugo's?] bishop.

                                       French. Our Mogul client No. 1 always addresses him as Mr. Alla Gappa and
                                       says that with such a name he can go anywhere.

                                       excellently and cheaply - and generally - here in Lucknow. I exhausted all
                                       my arguments for the sake of the elaborate ornament I was recommending until
                                       yesterday when he explained that he wanted it carved in stone! I find that
                                       the Indian workman, who "cannot read plans" and is "so stupid that he cannot
                                       be told anything" and is therefore "incapable of innovation" as interpreted
                                       by the European misunderstanding, is one who is capable of carrying out <u>anything</u>, as soon as he knows what is wanted, and is not
                                       satisfied with mere abstractions nor formulas which are all the usual
                                       architect can generally supply and which must therefore result in mechanism.

            <p><a name="d0e2642"></a>I have just learned one Indian word - "verandha" <a name="75"></a> [Note: i.e., veranda]
                                       through Mr. Alagappan's correction of my draft of his letter to Ahmedabad of
                                       the word that every draftsman since America has changed from veranda by
                                       adding the "h." Of the six ways in Sanskrit of rendering broad "a" the
                                       distinctly aspirated one with the accent is correct. This long lack of
                                       distinction of refinements of language on the part of both peoples makes
                                       mutual understanding difficult and curtails intercourse after three
                                       centuries of living together; "nabob" for "nawab" is as close as they
                                       generally get to the mark but the fact that the masters have had to learn
                                       the language of their life-long servants, even if after a fashion, seems to
                                       show that the Indians' difficulties are even greater than theirs.

            <p><a name="d0e2669"></a>were so unprotected against the sun and air that the wonder is where they
                                       found any privacy anywhere and my present conclusion is that they were on
                                       the right track at least so far as the climate of September, October,
                                       November, December, January, February have so far been, and I find that
                                       March, April and a part of May are also likely to be uncomfortable from <u>cold</u> if they could be said to be anything but perfect
                                       which they are out of doors. The Rajah when pressed by me finally said that
                                       of the three seasons in India the cool season was about seven months and the
                                       hot season and wet season halved the remainder between them including May
                                       and June in the former and July and August in the latter. Mrs. Palmer is
                                       habitually on the verandha <a name="76"></a> [Note: i.e., veranda] to get the sun during
                                       the day. The salvation of my cottage is the open doors to the East in the
                                       forenoon and the sunlight windows on the West side in the afternoon and I
                                       would not trade it for any respectable bungalow I have visited. One of the
                                       paradoxes of the European bungalow life is that after shivering around grate
                                       fires in gloom two thirds of the year, the occupants habitually spend the
                                       remaining four months in "the Hills" to escape the heat their homes were
                                       fictitiously designed to preclude. The Englishman who superintends the
                                       buildings and grounds of the University here and who has lived in India most
                                       of his life says to me that he scarcely remembers what the hot season is
                                       like since he has taken good care never to be here that season! The whole of
                                       New Delhi is as I have said before duplicated at Simla and presumably on the
                                       basis of such experience and judgment as of this Mr. Smith.

            <p><a name="d0e2724"></a>19 February, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin
                                       - At present I am checking and winding up as far as possible the Library
                                       details including the furniture lacking any item of which the Librarian says
                                       he will not bring the matter to a finality. His is the characteristic
                                       temperament of the new "Democracy" that believes in unanimity of opinion.
                                       Hence he is forever trotting out objections that have been raised after
                                       exhaustive canvass by all parties concerned. However he has sent to me the
                                       Authority <u>from Aligarth University for I am to prepare the
                                              designs for their Medical College and Hospital</u>. One thing about
                                       this predominance of the intellect in India is that though it can subvert
                                       through intellectual pride it means <u>impersonality</u> and
                                       does not subvert decision through <u>sympathy</u> and <u>antipathy</u>, the feelings, that have so often thwarted my
                                       efforts. On such terms I am reconciled to having no personal relationships
                                       for a while anyway.

            <p><a name="d0e2739"></a>My landlady who was born in India and has lived here 75 years is not Indian
                                       in this sense yet and I have failed to outwit her in the game I have been
                                       playing with her afternoon tea. My Bengal draftsman has chosen Calcutta
                                       working hours - 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. without intermission, for five and a half
                                       days which is much better than the 10 to 4 period seven days in the week of

                                       employment. When the bearer brought out my pot of tea and cakes at 4 P.M. I
                                       sent him back for an extra cup which he brought with frowns and grumbling
                                       and for which Mrs. P. at dinner lectured me on sharing with an Indian and
                                       one whose caste I didn't know. I cannot argue with her because she is so
                                       deaf, so on the next occasion I turned the whole tray over to my lunchless
                                       assistant because I am already dopey in the afternoon from over-hearty
                                       lunches. Though I warned him not to let the Bearer see him the jig was up

                                       Butler when Governor, out of recognition of the financial and cultural

                                       was not left with me to make the initial move which I shall do next with
                                       three other buildings whilst getting on with working drawings through my new
                                       experimental draftsman meantime. It sounds almost like organization of the
                                       work, but that is too good a name for this one-horse show yet.

                                       Spring and Autumn. Though there have been no rains, annual plants are
                                       springing up out of the ground magically and straightway blooming. On the
                                       erstwhile barren areas of my back door-yard are beautiful thistle-like weeds
                                       a foot and a half high bearing many yellow prickly poppies. The deadly
                                       nightshade datura, which is a perennial probably, is bearing white
                                       cornucopias 5 inches long but I am most

            <p><a name="d0e2828"></a>interested in a "ground carpet" of which one tiny-leaved dark mat is showing
                                       brightness in the sun and most attractive of all a miniature pinkish white
                                       convolvulus in crowns one inch high by a foot or two in diameter is
                                       sparkling with flowers in the mornings. This plant I find in the dooryard of
                                       the hottest part at the base of a south fronting brick wall, amongst loose
                                       rocks under a tree and even in the trodden areas of the motor turn where the
                                       only other living thing is an occasional tuft of couch grass. Nobody in the
                                       household or amongst the guests has ever stopped to notice such a plant if
                                       any plant at all and so I only surmise that it is an evergreen perennial
                                       from my four months experience during which it has bloomed off and on. The
                                       crown looks old and if I dig one up I expect to find it deep-rooted because
                                       it seems utterly indifferent to drought. Hence on the surface it seems to
                                       have the qualities I have been looking for to make a substitute for grass in
                                       many places where the care, watering, trimming and holding in check of grass
                                       are objectionable.

                                       wonderful garden schemes required constant flo oding and moving to keep them
                                       bright, and the more democratic and poverty stricken inheritors of these
                                       glories have had to let them fade. The University is an example and I am
                                       still battling for the preservation only of the arch-bridged stone-rimmed
                                       canal-like tank there because Dr. Walli Mohammed and others "cannot see"
                                       when it will be possible ever again to fill this with water. It is designed
                                       for irrigation purposes, higher than the surrounding gardens and would cost
                                       nothing for water on this account but requires only that the steam pump be
                                       removed to the river a third of a mile away and connected with such a pipe
                                       as I laid down to the Haven Estate and which still supplies the Kanevsky's
                                       and your house amongst others. This tank, by the way, must have cost as much
                                       as the new library itself and is a thing of beauty without any water to all

                                       the native trees on the streets and elsewhere shed their leaves most
                                       unexpectedly if gradually and for no apparent seasonal reason. There is no
                                       grand display of color, merely browning yellowing of the leaves and I am
                                       told the new ones will be back in a fortnight. Since the trees do not shed
                                       simultaneously the evergreen character of the landscape is not materially

                                       In India you never say "This is a fine day" because that is taken for
                                       granted, but one does not need to leave the weather out of consideration in

                                       Chowdhury?] I did attend a benefit presentation or exhibition rather
                                       of the rather worn film of "Chand Dass" which is the best known of the
                                       Indian talkies and which enjoyed a run of a year and a quarter in Calcutta
                                       some time ago. The theme and its presentation were somewhat obvious and
                                       lacking in action, for Westerners, but without affectation and the singing
                                       of the leading parts was especially delightful. The interior settings were
                                       rich but not aesthetically idealized as they would have been in Hollywood.
                                       Such a piece would therefore be unsuited for foreign screenings such as have
                                       been successful for German and French spoken films, but peculiarly adapted
                                       to the realist Hindu.

            <p><a name="d0e2933"></a>In a set of plans for the bank at Jhansi, I had demarked the square banking
                                       chamber with an intersecting arc dome and had even studied out the methods
                                       of calculating the single rowlock brick vaulting that would serve for both
                                       shells which, erected without centering and with relatively little
                                       reinforcing, makes a specially appropriate covering in this climate for
                                       important rooms. I shall be using this expedient in houses maybe. For some
                                       time I could not find out why my arguments of economy, insulation,
                                       appearance, etc. had no effect with Mr. Alagappan until he was obliged to
                                       say that Hindus do not use domes which are the prerogative of the
                                       Mohammedans! Of course, all the ancient Hindu domes are corbelled, and on
                                       the other hand the Muslim predilection for domes came from Christian
                                       Byzantium. But in some Hindu University work Mr. Alagappan had been forced
                                       to employ huge steel beams because the practical expedient of the arch was
                                       tabu.

                                       with good grace. And yet there are Buddhists of the Stupa tradition and
                                       Islamites to turn to for domes for variety, but Christians, Hindus,

                                       Still going like a scalded cat I have felt that I was coming to a hiatus
                                       this week with two clients off to distant parts before seeing their
                                       sketches, and others with work to be done and who are seemingly impatient
                                       who have failed to follow up with the requisite data for me to go on. The
                                       alternative bank plans went to Agra but there has been no time to hear which
                                       if either has found favor. The Raja however calls twice daily at least to
                                       see that there is no letting up of the pace.

                                       not a possible satisfactory alternative to the system of design and
                                       construction that makes all the houses in India uninhabitable practically

                                       the principle of the refrigerator which is open only at the top seems to be
                                       borne out here. If it were not so I can conceive of the Indians as baked in
                                       the ovens that their clustered congested houses, with few if any outside
                                       windows or cross drafts, would be. The cheerlessness of the cramped quarters
                                       with no view and little light, where even the roofs are high parapeted for
                                       privacy was not, in this case, compensated for by any charm such as might
                                       obtain with all the picturesque possibilities of interiors of varying
                                       levels, and the impression was of confusion and squalor.

            <p><a name="d0e2993"></a>In chatting with the Civil Servant who does my blue-printing I discovered
                                       that the Public Works Department have been busy with the plans for the
                                       Exposition which is an All-India and International affair. And what do you
                                       think the materials they are providing for are? Light steel framing and
                                       corrugated galvanized iron! And this in a region where they can be
                                       guaranteed to have no rain during the whole season of the fair and so there
                                       is here available the cheapest form of temporary construction that is used
                                       everywhere in the village - Bamboo frame work with woven cane lathing and
                                       mud and cow dung plastering both sides, all whitewashed in tints. Evidently
                                       the engineers are working on the unfortunate precedent of the Chicago Fair
                                       hoping that standardized materials will have a full salvage value. I shall
                                       give this policy short shrift when the matter comes into my hands. If there
                                       would be one thing better adapted than anything else to discourage patronage
                                       it would be such housing.

                                       is plenty here as he himself said when he showed me the cable, saying he put

                                       of your fees. I only hope you recognize it as a bit of Nichollism and that I

                                       Librarian. There were no objections on the part of the building authorities
                                       to anything.

            <p><a name="d0e3088"></a>One continually meets with difficulty in getting details or instructions
                                       carried out. Col. Haig of the I.W.B. says that he can never get any
                                       instructions carried out by the craftsmen no matter how reasonable or
                                       expedient they may be. As soon as his back is turned the worker proceeds as
                                       he was doing before, in his accustomed way, because he considers himself a
                                       qualified tradesman which the architect is not.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3091"></a>Unless the Mistri (foreman) can be convinced that the instructions are
                                       reasonable, which is likely only after long experience with the particular
                                       architect, the workers will not be moved from their customary ways. From the
                                       Mistry <a name="91"></a> [Note: foreman, overseer], provided the latter has been
                                       persuaded, they will take and carry out instructions because he is their
                                       equal, being a qualified tradesman in their craft. This system has preserved
                                       a standard of workmanship from the degradation that has superseded in
                                       Western countries. At the same time it exacts qualifications of the
                                       architect as masters in the respective crafts which they have not kept up
                                       and the craftsmanship has become fixed and stationary in consequence. This
                                       was borne home to me last night at the first comprehensive Village
                                       Industries exhibition of all India which was opened by Mahatma Gandhi here

                                       300,000 villages whose products are exhibited, also the processes themselves
                                       of deft handiwork in all materials which bring such a miserable pittance to
                                       the producers, perhaps one meal a day. Certainly the prices were tempting
                                       and highly competitive with the machine products in all lines.

                                       and the organization he leads for the purpose of popularizing these home
                                       products and giving continuous employment in the village and moreover a
                                       decent living for the Indians. But, as he said in his speech, the ordinary
                                       bazaars would be much more crowded during the evening than this exhibition.
                                       Amongst the thousands who were there I failed to notice a single person of
                                       European extraction. The exhibits are simply housed in shelters mostly of
                                       wicker mats and the whole has been done through voluntary labor by devotees
                                       who have in some cases been months finding their way afoot.

                                       you for your report, also the handbook. I agree as to everything done or
                                       proposed. Mr. Young has decided to take his six month's leave from the
                                       Pioneer, in England, at Doctor's orders, on account of his wife's illness
                                       and is flying off on the 18th May. He has offered me the use of his house
                                       rent free if I elect to stay in Lucknow but of course this involves the
                                       retention of cook and perhaps the other servants, also car and chauffeur if
                                       I wish. This would work out at least as economically as The Carlton Hotel
                                       and be eminently desirable. Of course if the Exposition eventuates it will
                                       be the solution of my problem here. Mr. Young advises strongly against
                                       plunging Marion into the Lucknow summer and I am waiting to see what it may
                                       be like. This I am writing on the verandha <a name="92"></a> [Note: i.e., veranda] of the
                                       Cawnpore West post office which is closed for some reason. It is the Chamber
                                       of Commerce Building where Shrivastova, whom I came to see, and Mr. Young
                                       who drove me over are both attending a meeting. Cawnpore reminds me of an
                                       American inland town in many ways. The largest textile mills are much in
                                       evidence and the interesting town is a park to all intents and purposes with
                                       large home places and tree enveloped meandering roadway drives. The bricks
                                       of the buildings are more in evidence than in the predominantly plastered

                                       black hair looked lovely in a pale blue dress with white shoes and gloves
                                       one of the ladies had given her, and Lute Drummond looked perfectly
                                       beautiful and like an angel, in a long drapey, silver (not grey, silver)
                                       gown and golden hair a halo, and played superbly, the most perfect
                                       accompanist I ever heard except perhaps the leader of the Boston symphony
                                       orchestra, Nikish <a name="93"></a> [Note: Arthur Nikisch?], who used to play
                                       accompaniments for the soloists in the concerts. She and Joan were as one.
                                       It is all like a wonderful fairy story.

                                       said it was wonderful to see how everyone loved me. It was a nice tell for
                                       her to pass on wasn't it? The series of concerts of Joan's have brought in
                                       &pound;1250 with which she sets sail for Europe on Saturday. If you had been at
                                       that concert you would have realized what a power Lute is in Sydney. (She
                                       was the founder of Opera in Australia. Was the only one who had an opera

                                       afternoon making costumes, at six o'clock we went down to the valley. We all
                                       felt it helped tremendously and eliminated worries for the coming
                                       performances. It was a full-moon night so we all enjoyed being down there.
                                       We have been most favored in the midst of very frequent rains in having good
                                       Sundays for our rehearsals. The fairies appreciate our recognition of them

            <p><a name="d0e3228"></a>6 April, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin -
                                       The warm weather here is much like Sydney's 96 degrees with considerable
                                       breeze and comfortable nights so far. At Cawnpore to which Mr. Young took me
                                       to visit Sir Jwala Prasid Shivastova, Minister of Education. etc. etc. I had
                                       a delightful outing. Here is a self-made man who controls large woolen mills
                                       who was educated at Manchester University and has been building himself a
                                       huge mansion, costly and ostentatious, without professional advice except
                                       from the 60 visitors such as I who have been invited to criticise. As the
                                       building was long beyond the stage where it might be cured, I confined my
                                       criticism to commendation of the unusual amount of light and air provided.
                                       However he was starting work on his 17 acre garden and I revised his
                                       drive-way arrangement presuming that no later critic has interfered. Even
                                       with such a type, the Knighthood is carried as a pocket weapon and no one
                                       addresses him as "Sir," and in seeking his address I found he is known as
                                       "J.P." to distinguish him from his two brothers.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3231"></a>While I was there he rang up the bungalow of the Director of Industries on
                                       whom I called in style with the Young's car and chauffeur. My competitors
                                       for the Exposition I was told are the firm of Ford and MacDonald,

            <p><a name="d0e3239"></a>is also the Chairman of the "Cawnpore Improvement Trust." However I quoted a
                                       price for a general plan which seemed to interest the Director and, as he
                                       requested, sent the next day an estimate of the cost of a unit of quadrangle
                                       frontage according to my own notion of plastic construction, not galvanized
                                       iron which they have in mind. This housing to the extent of a room 10'X12'
                                       comes to about Rs.40 net for the structure and an additional Rs.35 for
                                       embellishments, arcade lanterns, pinnacles, signs, banners, etc. and the
                                       whole takes the form of Pyramids, domes, arcades, etc. After my visit the
                                       Lucknow assistant called and showed me over the site and said he would be
                                       seeing me again with the survey feature plan of the whole of Victoria Park
                                       which has been allocated to them. If this comes off I shall accept Mr.
                                       Young's proposal. My servitors would consist of cook (Kahnsami) Rs.35,
                                       Sweeper Rs.16, Dhobi (laundry) Rs.10, Chouk (watchman), 1/2 Bearers' wage
                                       Rs.15, Electricity Rs.25, Household books, Rs.60.

            <p><a name="d0e3242"></a>The above would provide for entertainment to some extent and as much comfort

                                       occasionally stops here, reports meeting American missionaries in almost
                                       every town he visits. It is astounding to see the extent to which education
                                       in India, in the European sense, has depended on the Americans. The
                                       institutions named for the British such as "Canning College," "Hewitt

                                       being. And this is true of the Churches which are the established Church
                                       whose clergy are paid out of the Indian taxes as part of the cost of the

            <p><a name="d0e3275"></a>I have been interrupted by a visit of two officials of the Exposition who are
                                       anxious to get their ideas formulated, and a scheme to publish and circulate
                                       amongst the prospective visitors especially exhibitors. It seems that the
                                       Director of Industries (and of the Exposition) is still off on a trip with
                                       "J.P.", the Minister. At each visit I have thrown out some further hints of
                                       what I have in mind and evidently these officers are attracted by them.
                                       Anyway they are sending a preliminary survey plan tomorrow for me to operate
                                       upon in anticipation of a meeting of the Authorities on the 22nd. Mr. Young
                                       will be getting in touch with Shrivastova on his return hoping to get my
                                       authorization in order.

                                       on the diagnosis of all diseases and their allocation to special organs by
                                       means of investigating the crystals of the blood. The Hectors were here for

            <p><a name="d0e3313"></a>My piano has been at the Deans' for some six months. Little Kaaren tried for
                                       some time to work out the problem of why it was there and finally came to me
                                       with such a knowing tilt of her little head and such a look of understanding
                                       and said - "I know, you used to let Clarmyra (my niece in Chicago) use the
                                       piano and now you are letting me use it." Irven has her baby dancing class
                                       there these days with Cappy (Kaaren's mother) at the piano.

                                       given there, and that wee mite Kaaren sat the whole program through in her
                                       nighty gown and scarcely took her eyes off Lute in her simple flowing pale
                                       blue gown and her constant graceful gestures. Any suggestion that Kaaren
                                       should go to bed was met with a shrug of her shoulders and not even a
                                       turning of her eyes. I saw Lute's aura for the first time, a lovely golden
                                       radiance encircling her head. The creative art forces have risen and taken
                                       the place of the normal intellectual forces there. Lute said if she had
                                       known the baby was going to be there she would have made her talk for her
                                       but there was no need for doing that. It was a marvelous evening. What a

                                       cold. Fortunately I had set aside a chapter I had recently translated to
                                       meet possible needs, one labeled - An Easter Meditation - a chapter on
                                       chance showing that there is no such thing but that all this realm falls
                                       under spiritual law. It shows that what appears to be chance gives us a
                                       tie-over to the spiritual realms in this mechanical age of natural law, and
                                       enables us to <u>resurrect</u> the spirit in ourselves. It makes
                                       us realize that we have experience in other realms than those under natural

                                       close to her mouth, as she, a golden haired angel, reads a Steiner lecture
                                       to the group. If you-all didn't keep me so busy I'd paint that picture and

                                       now to give the attention necessary to authorize completion of plans and
                                       specifications. He likes the plans and elevations and queries only the size
                                       of guest rooms in the service wing which is a matter "neither here nor

            <p><a name="d0e3435"></a>I have been puzzled by the apparently general expectation that professional
                                       assistance is an honorary undertaking. Probably it arises from the
                                       aristocratic antecedents whereby the nobles could command any service and
                                       pay or not pay as the whim happened. The local Representatives of the
                                       Director of Industries, deploring the efforts of one of the committee men to
                                       take onto himself the duties belonging to the architect, says that the
                                       custom arises from the fact that 95% of the persons interested in such
                                       matters as buildings for instance are Civil Servants whose time consequently
                                       is of no value, on the basis that their income is patronage. Do you follow?

                                       in getting the whole scheme started and the publicity going, and the end is
                                       not yet. Lucknow is the center of popular interest for a few days because of
                                       the 51st Indian National Congress where the organized political thought of
                                       India gives itself free expression for which there is no scope in the
                                       Government institutions. Mahatma Gandhi has been, until recently his health
                                       has precluded, the leader of the movement but he is deemed too conservative
                                       by the present President Nehru who espouses Communism as the only road to
                                       independence. His socialist views are not yet shared by the majority which
                                       still looks to Gandhi, but he hopes for conversion among the younger element
                                       of the Congress, and quite possibly not in vain, in the future. What one
                                       could look for in Socialism in a country evidently 90% socialist already as
                                       indicated above - that industries are run by the Government - is only the
                                       threadbare hope that the majority could control things better than the
                                       experienced minority who may be mostly inferior to the majority but then
                                       again may prove to be only of the same low level.

            <p><a name="d0e3449"></a>Political wonders have been accomplished along Mr. Gandhi's lines, so much so
                                       that his thunder has already been stolen, but the step that will create
                                       wealth sufficient for better living conditions rather than the shift of the
                                       small quotum existing from one set of privileged beneficiaries to another
                                       set of privileged beneficiaries has yet to be taken, that is the building up
                                       of a complete National Economic Organization completely separated from the
                                       Political Organization. The huge and increasing taxation that is going to
                                       these special beneficiaries certainly operated to frustrate individual and

                                       find it very uncomfortable with the electric fan going for which my landlady
                                       charges me 5 rupees a month. When esoteric judgment counters reason I cannot
                                       be satisfied of its authenticity. That of Dr. Steiner seldom or never passes
                                       understanding, unprejudiced understanding, but that of his followers is
                                       sometimes less comprehensible. I think your letter to New Zealand was

                                       - So glad to get your letters today. They make everything so perfectly
                                       clear. We do hope Mr. Alagappan soon recovers. He shouldn't pile things up
                                       too high all at once. We think Colin Day's coming over will relieve both of
                                       you and hope it can be arranged before both of you work yourselves to death.
                                       Yes you buy the book "God Is My Adventure" there and send it on to Clarmyra.
                                       You'll probably not want to read it all but one gets such a thrill out of
                                       such a splendid ad for Steiner. The two pictures of him and of Krishnamurti
                                       are a striking comparison, the one - Krishnamurti - a perfect example of a
                                       most wonderful civilization giving us a bond with the past (and no wonder he
                                       can't read our modern dead philosophies),

            <p><a name="d0e3507"></a>Wouldn't it be a thrill to have a gold watch given you by the lady of the
                                       palace you had built. Do accept it if she really offers it to you. Have had
                                       a nice note from New Zealand from father. I had a good laugh over it. Am
                                       sending it to you by regular mail. We had a quarrel while he was over here
                                       because he was calling people niggers, dagoes, etc. He really behaved
                                       wonderfully over it but when he got to a safe distance away he had a good
                                       fling back at me as you will see in his letter. He's like little Mary who
                                       after a week of bread and water, said her prayer right when she thought she
                                       was going to be left out of the camping outing, and as soon as she got there
                                       said it wrong again. Mr. Pratten gave such an interesting report to his wife
                                       of Father's visit to their house that Mrs. Pratten told Mr. Nicholls she was
                                       very disappointed not to have been at home to meet him.

            <p><a name="d0e3510"></a>The other day I ran across in Steiner that creative accomplishment is not in
                                       vain because it has not manifested in material form but that it persists in
                                       the etheric realms where it is accessible to creative thinkers and continues
                                       to serve human progress. This can be a real comfort to architects whose work
                                       differs from that of other artists in being dependent on others for its
                                       material fruition.

                                       Steffen?] says "the Ego can become an organ of perception only if it
                                       becomes disinterested like an eye. In its gradual ascent to knowledge it
                                       becomes independent of the body..... The artist does not eliminate as does
                                       the scientist but uses the perceptible as a garment for the essential. The
                                       scientist produces a vacuum in his consciousness in order to grasp the
                                       creative essence. The artist strives after fullness of experience in order
                                       to give shape to a perfect work of art." Poincare, the scientist, says no
                                       creative idea ever came from reason.

                                       Our whole news this week is the production of the play - Everyman. A clear
                                       still night Sunday and a good audience sitting on their stone and backless
                                       seats in breathless stillness, gripped in the magic of that matchless
                                       valley, your gift. All the reports back were that they were deeply
                                       impressed. You wouldn't expect an old Church mystery play to be exactly
                                       popular but that's the position it seems to hold. Some liked it better than

                                       his rich bass voice was very appropriate. His mantel was the two Persian
                                       couch covers, black embroidered with gold, sewed end to end carried by four

                                       beginning and the close of the play and from where God (Mr. Herbert

                                       colored flares on the various groups, made a magnificent spectacle which
                                       never for a moment lost its simplicity and its lofty appeal.

                                       Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin. Wednesday - An hour after I mailed my air
                                       letter your cable came and I got much satisfaction out of its comprehensive
                                       word "Thankful." It was a wild scramble to get off but that seems to be my
                                       destiny or the one I bring down on myself. Before I forget I'll give you
                                       Nicholls' message which was that this week Mr. Eric Pratten's stairway has
                                       been settled. As he expressed it - he wore him down, so evidently he has
                                       been having the same kind of dance you had with the fireplaces. Yesterday
                                       was a mill pond, today white-caps but I am taking it all right. We had a
                                       bigger audience at the 2nd Everyman performance than at the first and
                                       everyone most enthusiastic. They let me off from back stage, or rather over
                                       the hill, duties to see the whole play. It was entrancing. Quite a number
                                       gathered afterward for a cup of tea. Pakie <a name="112"></a> [Note: Augusta Macdougall]
                                       who had brought half a dozen the first evening brought a dozen the 2nd time.
                                       The evening ended with complimentary speeches to me. Lute and Mr. Herbert
                                       were lovely, Lute saying I was a true human, no class, no distinctions.

                                       passport and visa business take such a time. I had cabled I was coming in
                                       all innocence having completely forgotten the fact and the jokes cracked
                                       about the fact that I should be a prisoner in Australia because you in your
                                       usual rush had gone off on my passport, the one about which the British
                                       Consul in Chicago had said "The American Government does do the most
                                       extraordinary things!" because you were going as my husband instead of my
                                       going as your wife. For they can't issue two passports to one person.
                                       However the young woman there in the Consul's office was very ingenious and
                                       wangled it for me saying the one you went on had expired in March though

                                       hands so we still have to thank the angels for Mrs. Maddocks. I did not get
                                       home till 4:30 and within a quarter of an hour Mrs. Evers dropped in. She
                                       was feeling bitter about something and I had to get the bitterness out of
                                       her (No good in one over 80 years of age) so we talked till seven and still
                                       no packing done. Monday Mrs. Maddocks and I had spent a few hours in town
                                       shopping, my need being summer things most of which she supplied me with out
                                       of her own wardrobe. You wouldn't believe it but all of her things fit me
                                       perfectly, dresses, hats, coat. After Mrs. Evers left I sorted out things
                                       for a while and then Mr. Junge was sent up for me from down below to bring
                                       me down in his car to a goodbye party of Castlecraggers. A good turn-up. Mr.

                                       with me. I didn't wake up till 6:30 in the morning and packed steadily till
                                       Mr. Deans came for me in his car at about 10. So trunk and valise were
                                       strapped on and heaven only knows what I am bringing and what I am leaving

                                       - There have been swift changes since I last wrote you. Castlecrag gathered
                                       to farewell Mrs. Griffin on Tuesday evening and waved her farewell on
                                       Wednesday. Mr. Nicholls made the suggestion that we should live in your
                                       house and that he would take over ours for the time being. I was very well
                                       pleased with the proposal he made. First it will be a real help financially
                                       but principally because I know of nothing I'd rather expend my energies on
                                       than Castlecrag and no one for whom I'd rather work than you. We're going to
                                       enjoy this house. I've always liked it and the magic still lingers though I
                                       admit I was appalled and amused at the contents of the garage as seen in the
                                       glare of the headlights. I can see that my mental dimensions for the
                                       duration of your absence will be understanding this filing system of yours.
                                       I look at CDCCCBB and am reminded of Tennyson's poem:- "Flower in the
                                       crannied wall, If I knew what you are Stem and all and all in all, I would
                                       know what God and man are." 21 May - Mr. Nicholls has been exceptionally
                                       nice and helpful to me. He solves all the problems that arise with a free
                                       and easy confidence and without fuss, and at the same time with a sense of
                                       responsibility

                                       somewhat aloof and formal (Probably because he is shy) is being quietly
                                       helpful. He prepared a set of sales plans, price lists and general
                                       information all neatly assembled in a folder for me and spent an afternoon
                                       driving me around to locate the blocks. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley

                                       for excitement.....My second attempt - Well Annette's letter is safely put
                                       away in her own writing desk, after I read it to her. Wally was also called
                                       upon to read it to her. She astounds with her sayings and what happened
                                       yesterday was so unusual that I can't help passing it on to you as I know
                                       you'll appreciate it fully. She had been ..... Well a third attempt - My

                                       - Marion is due in Calcutta where Mr. Alagappan will meet her and see her
                                       safely off in the Lucknow carriage of the Punjab Mail of the East Indian
                                       Rail Road which is broad gauge and well equipped. The train leaves Hourah
                                       (Calcutta) in the evening and reaches here about noon tomorrow. I could not
                                       make the journey myself because of my clamorous clients and moreover I would
                                       be as much lost in that direction as she. Marion can let down a peg her
                                       activities here, in fact the heat will enforce that if she is not otherwise
                                       relieved by the fact. I think she might find it a relief, but a whole month
                                       on the Pacific and Orient is a big dose to start with. Another six months
                                       alone on my part though would be too much. The two of us together will make
                                       it quite different.

                                       the to me seemingly great waste of effort this process destroys the

                                       ideals of the simple life. The hot season is on and it is delightful.
                                       Haven't yet experienced the extreme temperatures, only around 98&ordm;. So far,
                                       thanks to Mrs. Maddocks, I am properly equipped for clothes. In that little
                                       flame colored frock you made, Mrs. Maddocks, even my husband thought I was a
                                       "pretty goil" and took me out for a journey through a magic land of wonders.
                                       The evening before we had had a good two hours' walk about this district of
                                       palatial homes and gardens so I suspected nothing when after our dinner
                                       (always served at about half past eight) we went out into the brilliant
                                       moonlight and wandered across open fields and past low-lying, flat-roofed
                                       charming residences making one feel that he was walking through Castlecrag
                                       some 30 years hence only not the wide outlooks; and suddenly, without
                                       warning, came upon "la Martiniere" a palace for a king of kings, compared
                                       with which the palaces of Europe look like thirty cents. A magic scene, an
                                       astounding imaginative combination of the Grand Prix of the Beaux Arts and
                                       Indian splendour, an enormous building and fascinating from every angle. I
                                       shall try to get some photographs of it but photos can tell nothing. (I just
                                       now went into another room and found one of the bearers sewing a button on
                                       Mr. Griffin's pants.)

                                       see us at our meals being served by two butlers. At breakfast for instance,
                                       the one brings in 2 plates and sets them before us then stands at attention
                                       in the door of the butler's pantry while the other brings in two eggs on
                                       toast. No.1 majestically pours lime juice in our two glasses or brings
                                       coffee, the other brings a tiny stand with two pieces of toast. No.1
                                       presently follows with melons or mangoes or such. (And by Jove they know how
                                       to raise melons, no neighboring pumpkins to spoil their flavor as in
                                       Australia.) How's that for a woman who has always refused to have a servant
                                       in the house. Tonight we walked to town to a 6:30 movie, planning to have
                                       our dinner at nine, but no escape for Walt. A messenger came for him to the
                                       movie and when it was over he had to go to the United Provinces Office. They
                                       sent me home in a car and Heaven only knows when we'll get our dinner. But
                                       never mind, we'll have two butlers when it does come. We marvel at the most
                                       satisfactory achievements of your husband. What a record! Marion Mahony

                                       them. The last seems to be my case covering my journeys around and across
                                       the continents of North America (Where Griffin's practice was in 14 States),
                                       Australia, Europe and now Asia. In most ways it would have been more
                                       advantageous to have stayed at home for I could doubtless have accomplished
                                       more than I have to show for forty year's work but my compensation must be
                                       in having started things possibly in wide areas. Alexander had to conquer
                                       peoples to spread his culture. The British have already at one time or
                                       another conquered the countries in advance of us, for other purposes no
                                       doubt.

            <p><a name="d0e4400"></a>I do not know yet whether it will be effective on my part but I have found
                                       out that <u>there is a vast field for enterprise</u> amongst
                                       this 400,000,000 who are dissatisfied with their economic paucity and are
                                       finding political amelioration slow and painful. (We have to realize that
                                       here the British deliberately destroyed a highly developed industrial
                                       system, though not a mechanical one, ruthlessly in order to create a market
                                       for her own industrial products. The case was very different in other
                                       regions where she found quite primitive civilizations.) Private local
                                       capitalism is practically confined to the thrifty Parses who seem to be the
                                       small nucleus about which a prosperous India will have to grow. Through
                                       these some modern industries such as steel works and banks are already
                                       supplying employment for skill and talent at rates consistent with a
                                       suitable standard of living. The British also destroyed the unity of India
                                       by making separate States where there were Moslem majorities. <a name="117"></a> [Note: This

            <p><a name="d0e4422"></a>4 June 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric Nicholls. - The sun
                                       rises and sets a pure white these days. Today was full of incidents. In the
                                       morning, the contractor, a fine intelligent looking man, like an Arab, came
                                       in to make sure he understood the blueprint we sent him yesterday for the
                                       second story of a city building in a conspicuous position, the first story
                                       being already constructed. It is a strategic position to attract much
                                       attention. Later the general electric man (Indian) concerned with the
                                       electric fountain and Electric Tower building of the Exposition noticed the
                                       drawing of the interior of the picture theatre in the above building which I
                                       had just finished penciling, and was much interested in the lighting scheme,
                                       a series of diminishing bands from floor to ceiling concealing the lamps,
                                       each band a different color and he began to realize that Walt knew his
                                       business in that line. He wanted to know if Walt was doing the pylons in the
                                       exposition that way which he was.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4425"></a>After lunch the boys began making five blue prints of the Exposition plan and
                                       Walt who had been working on it since 6 A.M. had time to shave. I in the
                                       meantime had gone out to the show grounds with a very attractive man
                                       (English) who has charge of all the public plantings of Lucknow, is
                                       apparently energetic and has charge of the gardening of the show, and is now
                                       hard at work on it since he has a blue print of Walt's design for
                                       plantations. It was my first daylight tour of the city proper, we living in
                                       the South East and the show being to the North West of the City.

                                       beware and not use it with the point downward as in the emblem of the Soviet
                                       Republic which signifies materialization, but with the

                                       warmth, air, water, solidity - into the spiritual realms by means of the
                                       etheric forces which create the material realm - heat, light, sound and
                                       life. (Curiously enough the smashing of the atom has proved there is no
                                       matter, only form held in place by forces. Thus are the West and the East

            <p><a name="d0e4521"></a>I finished the working drawings for Dr. Batia's house adjacent to the
                                       University buildings, and construction is started though he hasn't got his
                                       complete specifications yet. I am sending you a copy, Mr. Nicholls. Thought
                                       you might show it to Mr. Pollard as the type of thing that would be nice on
                                       his Castlecrag lot. We think he ought to place his house on the edge of the
                                       second precipice, as that is the strategic position and it will always be
                                       easier to make the climb in connection with an outing on the Harbor than
                                       when pressed for time when going to town. Off to a movie.

                                       very pleasant young man and proving to be a valuable draftsmen and
                                       assistant, watchful and helpful in all sorts of ways and knowing the Hindi
                                       language as well as his own and the English, so a valuable interpreter -
                                       told us early this week that on Friday many thousands of people would be
                                       traveling to the Ganges to pray and bathe on Friday the 19th because of the
                                       eclipse of the Sun and 3 conjunctions and two squares - because, as I told
                                       him, with Walt's squares to the Sun in the Zenith, etc. it was no wonder he
                                       was having a rumpus with those in governmental positions. We could only hope
                                       that he had made some headway in conquering his planets as is the task of
                                       present-day humanity. Well two days later Mr. Shivdasanni, in charge of the
                                       exposition, came over with a hashed revision of the plan by the bad man of
                                       the story, Hosain <a name="122"></a> [Note: Hussain?], to put it up to Walt to accept all
                                       the ridiculous changes. In the mean time however Walt had seen the Chairman
                                       of the Exhibit, Mr. Carnegie, and had a good talk with him putting the case
                                       right. We think he must have

                                       Walt. That was Wednesday. From then till this noon (when the eclipse was
                                       over) we have been on a drafting drive from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. tracing the
                                       plan over, complying where possible with the silly suggestions, but
                                       introducing them in such a way as not to mess up the plan and really taking
                                       advantage of the retracing to add some lovely touches. I'll have to describe
                                       them to you some day. The plan, we think, is truly Anthroposophic, organic,
                                       the fertilizing of the lotus flower - the square penetrating the circle.

            <p><a name="d0e4551"></a>Well today at 5 P.M. was a committee meeting at which Mr. Shivdasanni said
                                       that Walt was in entire charge of the construction, and he repeated the
                                       statement at the formal meeting. So it looks as if the chief thing needed
                                       was won, the battle over and the victory Walt's which does not mean we are
                                       expecting an easy time but that apparently the way has been made possible
                                       for carrying on.

                                       faces. The Mozart and Faust evenings were charming. Lute used it as a sort
                                       of dress rehearsal for a performance she and her students were putting on at
                                       Hopewood House. Besides these musical evenings we had three lectures taken
                                       by Mr. Lightband, Mr. Herbert and myself. The social atmosphere was a little
                                       divided by the fact that several with a little group of friends got so
                                       involved in domesticity and a high sense of office respectively that they
                                       had no time to attend the lectures. It was a happy time and the weather was

                                       am taking the lead at the Nicholls'? So far there has been very lively
                                       interest and Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls are both very keen to have a group
                                       meeting at Castlecrag. Glyn produces his books the moment he sees me. It has
                                       become the order of the day that he and I shall engage in story telling the
                                       moment I arrive. At table he asked for a helping of crocodile referring to
                                       sardines on a wee dish. The word has only just appeared in his vocabulary.
                                       He told me yesterday in a whisper that when he is a big, big boy he is going
                                       to have a baby sister. Whether there is any truth in this statement or not I
                                       do not know. I did not repeat so great a confidence to his Mother. The
                                       little Cragites have lost temporarily a marvelous friend in you. Mrs.
                                       Nicholls told me that when she knew that you were not to be in Castlecrag on
                                       her return from Melbourne she didn't want to come back at all even. You have
                                       heard perhaps of Mrs. Trinick's achievement - twins! A heart's desire
                                       apparently amazing though this sounds. As a result of being X-rayed to
                                       ascertain some weeks before the findings were for one child, so the twins
                                       caused considerable astonishment. When I stopped to ask Ida (Leeson) for a
                                       message for you she grumpily said, "Tell her it's time they came home
                                       again." Affectionately, Florence Birch to Marion Mahony Griffin

                                       glad Rachel (brother Jerome's wife) is with you. She should not go back to
                                       Mexico but I know the appeal of the tropics. She ought to be able to teach
                                       Miss Reynolds the tricks of how to live comfortably in a hot country. The
                                       chief thing we have found is kerosene which seems to be the essence of all
                                       the curative qualities of the vegetable kingdom. It takes the itch and sting
                                       out of all bites; on the floor - mop the floor with any of the kerosene
                                       preparations - and no fleas, etc. will come or stay in the house; kerosene
                                       put on a tick on your skin and he will promptly withdraw. It cures bull ant
                                       bites, etc., etc. Am sending some of the letters that come to make you

                                       story of Canberra and my efforts there through local jealousy has been
                                       repeated in miniature with this Exposition. Again my coming into the
                                       undertaking has interfered with ambitions for knighthood, etc. and for two
                                       months the Director was bamboozled into making four successive starts until
                                       he realized that the precious time was slipping by without getting any
                                       "forrader" and on the 19th June announced that thenceforth I was in full
                                       charge of the construction. After that I was able to get the surveys and
                                       assistance all along the line needed to enable me to design the 57 varieties
                                       of buildings and fix their locations and levels together with the quarter
                                       mile of terracing, three acre fountain basin, 25,000 seat stadium, quarter
                                       mile track, etc., etc., and last week a contract was let to a Cawnpore firm
                                       to carry out the whole.

            <p><a name="d0e4611"></a>The buildings, aside from the amusement section, will cover half a million
                                       square feet. They will be rich with sculpture and ornament all flood-lighted
                                       in colors from sources concealed within themselves and form a consistent
                                       white city with roofs as well as walls consisting of clay with tinted
                                       whitewash. All building materials are of local origin in the strictest
                                       sense, and the framework will be chiefly of bamboo.

                                       was used at the last Indian exposition at Allahabad in 1910. Almost to the
                                       finish there was keen competition amongst the contractors at an even lower
                                       price. The buildings will cost less (8 annas) than one shilling and two
                                       pence sterling per square foot with the outer work of stadium, fountain
                                       basin (Concrete) and enclosure walls and fencing over a mile long thrown in.

                                       completion in October. We have really enjoyed the wet weather in Lucknow.
                                       The heat has been no longer oppressive as it was in April and May but for
                                       the most part very comfortable. I am sure you would have enjoyed it. Marion

                                       cannot imagine going to all the inconvenience and suffering all the
                                       disabilities in carrying on their work except that it is Government work and
                                       does not count anyway. My trip up there to meet with a committee was a
                                       complete fiasco so far as the work went but it was an experience. Marion has
                                       not been on any of these trips which are hurried and on business. She has
                                       not even begun to see Lucknow yet. Nor was she on the hot trip to Agra a few
                                       weeks ago where I was the guest of the family of a Brahmin in the heart of
                                       the old city along side the fort. Those city houses are merely ovens and the
                                       Indians are realizing it only after several thousand years of trying to
                                       become inured to them. My client was Mr. Mathur who has done a remarkable
                                       thing in organizing the Agra Co-operative Housing Co. which is building up
                                       its suburban estates with bungalows. I am to plan their most recently

                                       (Walt's sister) to Walter Burley Griffin - Dear Walter and Marion, Since
                                       Marion has followed we have lost you both. I'm not the one to talk. I've not
                                       been expressing our appreciation of your long letters - but I have been
                                       missing them. You seem ages away. I'll be as bad as Dad - and he finds it
                                       hard to take - How he does think he hates India! You seem absolutely lost to
                                       him - and he finds it hard to take. Roy <a name="128"></a> [Note: Lippincott, Genevieve's
                                           husband] is now British. His naturalization papers are a fact. The
                                       American Consulate now invites him to say he has no further use for the
                                       U.S.A., off with the old love, on with the new! When I read the document I
                                       was most amazed at the attitude. Roy explained that Mr. Boyle says nobody
                                       ever signs it. He sends it out - his duty is done - finis.

                                       conditions do not appeal to my fancy - but from the point of view of your
                                       work it must be fascinating though I should think that all Indians to work
                                       with would be most trying (Which was quite contrary to the fact M.M.G.). Am

                                       are trying to come to an understanding of what Steiner's Threefold
                                       Commonwealth intends. We have started to read the notes on it now. We are
                                       studying his "The Gospel of St. John" now in the afternoon class with Mrs.
                                       Coe. She is a remarkable teacher. Do send father frequent notes, just so he
                                       can feel in touch. The copies Marion used to send I would read to him - once
                                       or twice even and then he'd take them off and study them by himself. If you
                                       had seen him this time you would realize that quick and keen as he is, he is

                                       Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin - Deirdre is at the Deans' this morning.
                                       Irven Herbert has a group for rhythm and Deirdre loves it. Turning
                                       somersaults is her latest thrill. The blue dragon in the center of your
                                       Chinese rug known as "Griffin's lizard" is the taking off ground. With her
                                       head placed on this and a good aim she ends up with feet on the twin lizards
                                       in each corner in turn. She hung about me while I poured tea for a visitor,
                                       grumbling about something. When I turned my attention to her and found out
                                       what it was, she said- "That big thing is sitting on Griffin's lizard!"
                                       Obviously there was no doubt in her mind as to the relative importance of
                                       the woman and the lizard. I found an excuse to move her chair and Deirdre
                                       ran outside quite happy again. I'll send your clothes and Mr. Griffin's
                                       garters which I have found. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion

                                       anticipated all my life. I set out desperately to be economical, no hot

                                       vegetables, saving electric current by leaving only one light on in the
                                       evening and retiring early, daylight saving by rising at 5:30 a.m. power
                                       saving by turning off the electric refrigerator at night and by allowing

                                       spending on vegetables and fruit before. I transferred the latter purchase
                                       to one of the Bearers. Inspection of the rendered accounts for bakery,
                                       dairy, grocery for which I have insisted that only orders signed by me
                                       should be acknowledged show that last month Marion and I consumed 30 quarts
                                       of milk, 33 loaves of bread and 40 pounds of sugar. We are both in good
                                       health but Marion is no fatter than usual and I find my weight for the first
                                       time down to what it was when I left this hemisphere 23 years ago, i.e. 137
                                       pounds. In all our household supplies for June amounted just under Rs. 200
                                       in addition to the part of the wages of the staff that I pay - Rs 135. Such
                                       is life in India, the cheapest place in the world to live and where the <u>average</u> income of the 350,000,000 people is Rs. 3 per
                                       month! Gandhi lives on Annas 3 per day. I think I know where the main
                                       difficulty lies, in the kitchen, but under the circumstances I have not
                                       taken the drastic action that I should if these were my own staff and the
                                       house were on different terms. One has to be set against the other to a

            <p><a name="d0e4783"></a>13 July 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls - Although
                                       there are still perhaps a dozen or so of the 60 odd different types of
                                       buildings of the Exposition for which elevations have not been sketched,
                                       they are mostly the insignificant service buildings. The contract has been
                                       let to a Cawnpore firm for 7 and one half annas per foot. This is less than
                                       my original estimate but the largest Lucknow contractor and the wealthiest
                                       and most liked by all was willing to take it for one half anna less so his
                                       manager told me. Doubtless there was some political reason for not accepting
                                       his bid. In their present mood both the proprietors and the contractors are
                                       disposed to let me work out the most economical way of getting the result.
                                       The present unpopularity of my enemy, Hosain <a name="131"></a> [Note: Hussain?], is
                                       evidenced by the visit this morning of his wealthy client, Bhargava, who has
                                       asked me to redesign the large house for Bhargava's brother and to take
                                       charge of the construction hereafter. The house I am building for Dr. Batia,
                                       half way up now is six feet under water! What it is like after its bath

                                       was central when Lucknow had a million inhabitants, and it is the focus of
                                       the main roads today as well as of historical interest.

                                       with the people of this wonderful civilization that Mr. Griffin had
                                       expressed. This in spite of the fact that their social system and their ways
                                       of thinking are as utterly different from ours as their language which is
                                       almost impossible for a European to learn. You simply can't understand the
                                       simplest sentence even knowing the words and having memorized the sentence
                                       and knowing the meaning. It simply doesn't make sense. The whole matter is
                                       so reversed and so

                                       the atmosphere is one of a people completely alive, with all capacities
                                       functioning, deep interests and great enthusiasms and confidence, no vestige
                                       of the fears which dominate the life of the European peoples and shatter
                                       their soul forces. There is a great interest in modernism but no tendency to
                                       limit enterprise to the material to the elimination of soul and spiritual
                                       qualities and output. In material ways it looks as if India would be
                                       accomplishing in fifty years what it has taken America a hundred and fifty
                                       years to accomplish.

            <p><a name="d0e4817"></a>The menace lies in the possibility of its becoming a centralized movement
                                       whereas the urgent need throughout modern countries is for decentralization,
                                       especially functionally - three types of organization - each independent of
                                       the others - to meet the needs of the body, of the soul and of the spirit of
                                       human beings in a society, each organization as different in form and scope
                                       as these three entities of the human being are. It would be a pity if India
                                       had to go the circuitous way in the solving of her problems that Europe has
                                       taken.

                                       thinking or customs) in that she has highly developed intellectual
                                       capacities which belong to the Post-Atlantean stream of evolution whose
                                       function down through the immediately past millenniums has been to develop
                                       man's thinking powers whereas the American-Indian peoples dropped out of the
                                       stream in going to the West from Atlantis instead of East, and retained the
                                       picture consciousness universal in those long past times.

                                       thinking from her nearest neighbor - the United States - to enable her and
                                       the United States to develop together the double form of
                                       picture-plus-rational thinking which is the essence of 20th Century thinking
                                       now overdue. Perhaps that change is now coming about.

            <p><a name="d0e4831"></a>The consequence in India is that when the European tries to match his
                                       intellect against that of the Indian or Moslem, he finds he hasn't a chance.
                                       We were interested in the unanimity of advice from Europeans here never to
                                       go to law, that one would have no chance against the subtleties of the
                                       thinking powers of these men.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4834"></a>I arrived in Lucknow just as Griffin was completing the General Plan for the
                                       Exposition. Within a week the plans were completed and the specifications
                                       for what terracing of the grounds was required, with location and
                                       embankments for the great reflecting pool, and the specifications
                                       determining the type of construction for the buildings, some of them brick
                                       plastered as is universal in Lucknow, others a type he had noticed with
                                       interest which is being used in some of the rural districts, a bamboo frame
                                       covered with a woven basket work covered with a concrete-like mud so
                                       generally used, which would make it possible to get a great variety of form
                                       at a very low cost. He could also count on the use of considerable ornament
                                       and filigree tracery which is used very extensively here and done at an
                                       amazingly low cost.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4837"></a>The next weeks were devoted to driving out certain type designs which made it
                                       possible to get a fairly close estimate of the total cost from the
                                       contractor on the basis of area. The next six months were a terrific drive
                                       for both architect and contractor to get ready for the announced opening
                                       date in December. One can glimpse the difficulties when one realizes that
                                       there were no drafting boards nor tee-squares in Lucknow. Finally one big
                                       board was found in the Technical School, another in a Government office and
                                       carpenters were set to work to make others. A couple of tee-squares turned
                                       up from somewhere and we sent to Bombay for others. Neither were draftsmen
                                       to be found. So finally the Government allowed some eight or ten of the
                                       senior Technical school boys to get credits from their work in our office
                                       which filled two big rooms of the house.

            <p><a name="d0e4840"></a>So these young fellows in their teens came into what might be called a
                                       kindergarten of architecture. None had ever used a tee-square.

                                       driving and scolding them, they called me "Mother" and had a real affection
                                       for me as I had for them. But with a design a day to be turned out, sketches
                                       completed and rendered for exhibition and publication to be sent all over
                                       India, and working drawings during the whole six months and endless details
                                       for the structures, and forms all new, it was a task one wouldn't care to
                                       undertake more than once in a lifetime.

            <p><a name="d0e4851"></a>At the same time there was a continuous succession of private clients whose
                                       needs had to be met. Though the draftsmen had the routine European hours,
                                       since that was established in Government Offices though by no means
                                       elsewhere in India, neither Mr. Griffin nor myself nor our clients were
                                       bound by them for from seven o'clock in the morning till ten at night anyone
                                       was likely to drop in and, as one of our most continual visitors said, he
                                       had never come in, at no matter what time, that he did not find me at the
                                       drafting board.

            <p><a name="d0e4854"></a>Things were complicated here again by the fact that we were working for the
                                       government and up against all the delays and inefficiencies and enmities
                                       that are inevitable when an outsider is brought into officialdom though in
                                       this case it was the head of the Industrial Department who came to Griffin
                                       and asked him to take on the work. He himself often found himself helpless
                                       in the coils of the machine. The chief source of delay and difficulty was an
                                       illegitimate child of half European blood with consequently an inferiority
                                       complex and great motive force in obstruction.

                                       physically, charming and appreciative in manner, earnest, devoted and
                                       hardworking, and eager and enthusiastic at the opportunity of having the new
                                       experience and the training that Mr. Griffin was offering them. They were in
                                       fact fine, sometimes exquisite, draftsmen, or what would be more technically
                                       known as tracers. One, an older man, who was with us for a while, was an
                                       incredibly exquisite draftsman. Never have I seen such marvelous drawings as
                                       he got out when he was given an ornamental detail to carry out for
                                       publication. Rarely would a draftsman be called upon in any office today for
                                       such a range and variety as was required for this exposition for, although
                                       the construction was simple, the drawings were far from being simple.
                                       Parabolic domes were things that solved themselves in actual construction
                                       with bending bamboos, but were by no means simple problems for a draftsman
                                       to solve for either elevations or sections or perspectives - sketches, plans
                                       and details driven through in a few months, a greater variety than would go
                                       through any architect's or a dozen architects' offices ordinarily in the
                                       course of their whole experience.

                                       instead of doing it personally arose not only from the fact that, though a
                                       number of these young people spoke English apparently fluently, they, even
                                       the best of them, rarely really understood an instruction which lack of
                                       understanding could become apparent only after they had made the drawing.
                                       But there was also the greater difficulty in that they were in fact too much
                                       inclined to think things out themselves. It was extremely difficult for them
                                       to take an instruction. In their own work they were in the habit of doing
                                       what really came out from within themselves, carrying on one might say in
                                       the blood stream the results of millenniums of experience in their own

            <p><a name="d0e4900"></a>We had in the office two more experienced men, Mr. Halder, a Hindu, who was
                                       our head draftsman, and Mr. Mohsin, a Mohammedan, who was our
                                       Superintendent, the out-door man and much older than Mr. Halder. They were
                                       wonderful assistants in every way, absolutely trustworthy and most
                                       painstaking and watchful of our interests in every direction. It was
                                       interesting to see what a close friendship grew up between these two men,
                                       one Hindu and the other Mohammedan. I had interesting discussions with Mr.
                                       Halder especially when I found that he belonged to a comparatively new
                                       group, the Vishnavarites, for in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
                                       Vishnu though spoken of was for the Indians the unknown God, the one who had
                                       not yet manifested. Mr. Halder was very devoted and conscientious in giving
                                       the required time - long hours daily - to his mediations, and I as an
                                       Anthroposophist could speak to him on even terms as to why Christianity,
                                       resting today on faith, could not hold its own with the Indians whose
                                       religion was based on knowledge, supersensible knowledge. I called his
                                       attention to the fact that if he was entirely unprejudiced - that is without
                                       pre-judging - (in which case he would see true in the supersensible realms)
                                       his supersensible experiences would reveal to him that Vishnu was the Indian
                                       name of the God who incarnated in Palestine whose name to the Europeans was
                                       Christ. It would be interesting indeed if, having taken a definite stand
                                       against any Christianizing in India as they have done, as is confirmed by
                                       all the missionaries I had an opportunity to talk with, the Indian should
                                       come, through the work of this group, in its own way, to a knowledge of
                                       Christianity, of the incarnated Ego.

                                       ones because of his absolute integrity which over and over again foiled the

                                       have any idea how much I appreciated that wonderful letter of yours. It was
                                       so very kind of you to spend so much time on me when you are so desperately
                                       busy, and you will be pleased to hear that it did me a world of good when
                                       you told me how you laughed, well I laughed too, and the very fact of
                                       laughing put an entirely different perspective on the matter, and I really
                                       think that from now on there will always be an aspect that I shall find
                                       humorous. Mack has been very good with the Anthro meetings, I do not think
                                       he has missed one of them but I have missed several. You know that I find
                                       that my greatest joy was the talks with you after the meeting, how's that
                                       for an heartfelt compliment? Have just sent on your second community letter.
                                       What a wonderful time you must be having. It has always been one of the
                                       dreams of my life to visit India. I really intend to one of these days when
                                       the children are on their feet and I can be free. I would not mind hiking
                                       through India with a begging bowl if there were no other way to see it. You
                                       will remember how Mack and I hiked across from San Francisco to Chicago
                                       dragging the babies in a cart. The parts I want most to see are the Northern
                                       parts, the Kashmir valley and the mountains up from the valley toward Leh.
                                       Perhaps I'll get that trip yet. Dorothy Searby to Marion Mahony Griffin

                                       been under construction for some three or four weeks but there have been

                                       higher than in last month's flood and some 4,000 buildings in Lucknow
                                       collapsed. The powers and potentates come in day by day and jobs outside the
                                       show are piling up. The latest is the modernizing of a hundred of the 500
                                       rooms of a former Raja's 500 wives, by a descendant whose quota is about one
                                       fifth, for the renovation of which Walt will be making sketches shortly. He
                                       has quoted him Rs. 2,500 for plans. The publisher of the Wild Life Magazine
                                       brought him this job. He is greatly interested in Walt's architecture, says
                                       it is original. The plans for the Agra subdivision go tomorrow, charge Rs.
                                       400. These figures are for Mr. Nicholls' benefit.

            <p><a name="d0e4941"></a>Mr. Searby, (a chiropractor) you will be interested in the following
                                       quotation from Dr. Steiner:- "The etheric streams follow the path of the
                                       nerves." As you know the etheric forces are the life forces. I sent you a
                                       clipping about the cobra. It is wonderful to have wild peacocks light in
                                       your yard and wander around, and to see monkeys around who can take care of
                                       themselves. And every night we hear the lions roar (only that is because the
                                       Zoo is so near). What a pity it is to be honest. It spoils so many good
                                       stories.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4944"></a>The other night we were walking to a movie when we encountered a stream
                                       across the road. I didn't want to wade across it in my new cream shoes (you
                                       know Mrs. Maddocks) so Walt carried me across pick-a-back. Just then with a
                                       footman running ahead to make sure the crossing was safe, along came a
                                       resplendent coach and four in all its panoply and some 8 or more people in
                                       this commodious sort of charabank <a name="132"></a> [Note: large open carriage?] in full
                                       view with the Rajah of Jahangirabad in the rear seat so he got a full view
                                       down the retreating road. Among his guests was the Governor. All that is not
                                       completely true in this story is that Walt insisted on our waiting standing
                                       by till this magnificence had passed before he would carry me across
                                       dangling on his neck, so the Rajah missed a sight I am sure he would have
                                       enjoyed.

                                       majestic one I spoke of, died so suddenly one night that it was thought at
                                       first he must have been bitten by a snake. We all went out to their
                                       quarters, a group of buildings on the border of the compound - and his
                                       little wife sobbed in my arms for an hour and more crying "Mon Raja, mon
                                       Raja est mouri" - My king, my king is dead - (see the resemblance to
                                       French). She stopped only when one of the gardeners, a Brahmin (of the
                                       highest caste but working as a day-laborer with the others - in the
                                       gardening - you see how we misunderstand the caste business) said "you must
                                       stop crying, Memsahib (myself) tells you to stop crying." There are seven
                                       children. Das had been bearer to the Editors of the Pioneer for 25 years and

                                       the exposition have by no means all been smoothed out and because of the
                                       deep-seated motives and persistence of our few opponents we have to make
                                       continual fresh starts and sidetrack efforts in the face of time limits
                                       which do not provide for that sort of thing. The official Director is a weak

                                       to fears which are pumped into him incessantly, and makes important
                                       decisions without consulting me. If not reversed, sooner or later these

                                       Another battle royal fought and won. Day before yesterday Walt sent in his
                                       resignation to the Exposition Director. Yesterday, in the presence of the
                                       Minister, the Director agreed to Walt's requirements, and today at 7 a.m.
                                       everybody is over at the grounds welcoming the Governor who is here to see
                                       how things are getting on. The enemy who has a Hitleresque power with the
                                       Director fought tirelessly for his various destructive points but lost on
                                       all of them. Walter's three requirements were First:- that his plan should
                                       be considered as final and no changes to be made except omissions if the
                                       Governor found they couldn't afford them, leaving the way open to build if
                                       means were found later. Second:- Control of all money expended thus control
                                       of contractor who was inclined to take the enemy's advice and cut out
                                       everything except raw construction since he is being paid per square foot of
                                       area of foundations. Now he will be paid only on Walter's certificate.
                                       Third:- That decisions on all matters, final ones, could be made by the
                                       Director's brother who lives here so is constantly available and who is
                                       sympathetic to making the show beautiful instead of a shanty town. This
                                       meant that some work already done over Walt's head in the wrong place will
                                       be torn down, etc., etc.

            <p><a name="d0e4996"></a>The package you sent arrived much to our satisfaction. Walt's eyes stuck out
                                       when he saw the box of chewing gum. He immediately took one of his kind and
                                       I one of my kind. The next day when he saw me chewing he asked me if it was
                                       the same piece I had taken the day before. As a result of long training and

                                       I refused to tell him. The next time

                                       oftener than monthly though probably the boats don't get them over oftener.
                                       We enjoy our association with the Indian people very much though in our wild
                                       rush at present we contact only those connected with our work but an
                                       architect's work brings him in touch with all sorts of people. I have been
                                       thrilled from the beginning with how many handsome men there are. One sees
                                       every European type only instead of being homely <a name="134"></a> [Note: "ugly" has been
                                           crossed out] as our menfolk are (father excepted) these are
                                       perfectly beautiful. We rarely see the women though I have glimpsed several
                                       lovely ones. Occasionally a man brings his wife along to see the strange
                                       Mrs. Griffin, architect and draftsman, working at her drafting board twelve
                                       hours a day. They always have the satisfaction of finding me there. When
                                       here one realizes that India can never be unified nor have a feeling for
                                       humanity as a whole until the seclusion of women ends. There is no way of
                                       their knowing each other. There is no social life, only family life except
                                       in the small villages where there is some neighborliness. This is a general
                                       statement. There is a very considerable number of individual women who are
                                       getting a thorough education and are functioning in community affairs,
                                       including exhibiting and lecturing at the Exposition.

            <p><a name="d0e5016"></a>Lillian <a name="135"></a> [Note: Lillian Hamilton Moore?], you remember the darling
                                       contraption you gave me some years ago, the necklace of sewing equipment. I
                                       let Walt bring it over with him. It is one of our constant companions and
                                       reminder of you. Was sorry not to have been able to send you the pointers re
                                       the Haven Theatre shows for publication but the pressure hasn't given us a
                                       moment. And Dorothy <a name="136"></a> [Note: Searby], you can rest easy re the Teddy bear
                                       mascot you gave me. The little Koala is being well cared for. Our Siamese
                                       cats Minnie and Monster had a family of four kittens and as they get older
                                       and scamper off on their own, much to the anxiety of their mother, she takes
                                       much satisfaction in taking Koala off my dressing table, walking off with
                                       him

                                       him. These Siamese cats are more like dogs than cats, demand attention, want
                                       to be talked to. If I don't pay attention to Monster he gets up on his hind
                                       legs with his front paws on my legs and gazes into my face. If I don't pet
                                       and talk to him he jumps upon me as if he were climbing a tree, not at all
                                       pleasant with my thin clothes, now I pay attention to him when he demands
                                       it. At times it is quite a problem to keep him from settling under my chin
                                       on my drawings or letters to lie for hours. Our Indian draftsmen watch to
                                       see how I treat Monster. I'm sure I'm being judged thereby.

                                       drawings is here, so I must to breakfast and then to my task. I have a
                                       regular kindergarten of architecture here, ten draftsmen who are having to
                                       do tasks quite beyond them so I have to teach them projection, etc. and keep
                                       my eyes peeled for mistakes all the time.

                                       Just received Miss Birch's letter with the great news about Stella Miles
                                       Franklin's prize for her new book - "All That Swagger" and the promise of
                                       its publication. (It is a great story. All Americans should read it - a true
                                       story of pioneer life in Australia.) Love and congratulations to her.
                                       Received Lute Drummond's lovely letters. Am so glad she kept the
                                       Anthroposophic Fairy Tales. No time for reading them here these days. When
                                       her class has translated them she could have each one write out one
                                       translation and then Miss Shead could make five copies of each for the
                                       Castlecrag children's library. I have a Steiner book with a number of
                                       Children's and Mother's prayers. Will send some on when I get a chance to
                                       translate them. Marion Mahony Griffin

                                       when the Youngs may return. However we are first going to shop around for a
                                       lot on which to do the same thing in a different way and not lose all the
                                       principal in 4 months, little though that amount may be. It does not look as
                                       if our Monsoon were over for when it does not rain we drip and only when it
                                       does rain is it cool. Either way is a relief however since the construction

                                       Marion is working like a slave and she is the only effective help I have had
                                       for this exhibition. (Mr. Molder worked only on the private jobs.) We should
                                       be further ahead if we had not experimented with a dozen scratch draftsmen
                                       whom she spends much time teaching and then doing their work over again.
                                       However things are moving somewhat out on the grounds so that in the face of
                                       the floods during July and August which covered and may again cover half the
                                       site the showing was quite a surprise for the Governor whom the Public Works
                                       Department had led to believe that the task was impossible.

            <p><a name="d0e5077"></a>Our boy contractor who is living with us comes home entirely discouraged at
                                       each constructional problem, where his foreman talks and where detractors
                                       decry. But a way seems to open immediately afterwards. Lately it was that
                                       the poles sagged so that nobody would risk erecting the first 50 foot peak
                                       but they did it and it was raised. Yesterday after a day's struggle the
                                       bamboo ribs of domes and vaults would not bend and that because of the snake
                                       season and the floods no green ones could be obtained for two months! Then a
                                       good fairy came along who told us what to do and the dry bamboos are being
                                       stored in the Hussainabad Tank under water for three days to make them
                                       pliable.

                                       difficulty of it lies in the limited time. There is no leisure to apply the

            <p><a name="d0e5091"></a>After a lapse of some months, heard from our bank job at Jhansi this week
                                       when the supervisor got into deep water through having substituted
                                       inadequate steel beams for the reinforced concrete roof girders I had
                                       designed for the <a name="138"></a> [Note: Jwala] bank. So I paid my first visit to this
                                       town about 190 miles South West spending a day there redesigning a Manager's
                                       residence, redesigning the interior of the bank to provide for the
                                       structural change, and detailing the exterior modeled ornament of columns,
                                       cornices, etc. Here I had my first experience of modeling full size in damp
                                       clay and with three or four assistants a perfect model resulted only to be
                                       destroyed, before it could be copied in mortar, by urchins who ran over it.
                                       So this had to be done again from scratch in position in two variations. The
                                       horizontal members and ornament were modeled in lime mortar in the first
                                       instance, a slower but more reliable process.

                                       city. This veritable castle is the most impressive I have seen yet though
                                       its situation is not as spectacular as that of Gwalior. It has towering
                                       bastions, barbettes, bassillions <a name="139"></a> [Note: "Basilians" in Section I, No. 5, p.
                                           112], barbicans, bartizans, merlons, battlements, parapets,
                                       posterns, sorti-ports, citadels and redoubts galore and in stone too. I
                                       surmounted one of those rocky buttes that are characteristic of the
                                       district, and the walled city lies at its base. (No wonder he was never

                                       and untidy. It is predominately Hindu and abounds in beautiful cylindrical
                                       temples which are far more imaginistic though less comprehensive than the
                                       studied Mohammedan buildings of the United Provinces.

                                       different in appearance, on the whole, lighter and not so hardboiled as the
                                       natives of this Province. I was surprised in all this because I had known of
                                       Jhansi only as a military center, and a Railway town of the Great India
                                       Peninsular System. The stone is evidently intractable and is in irregular
                                       chunks laid with considerable range in sizes and plenty of mortar sometimes
                                       interspersed with the oriental bricks about one inch thick - which were
                                       universal before the European influx - and which give a beautiful texture. I
                                       also found some really beautiful brown brick of this shale-field texture
                                       never intended for plastering as in the case of the United Provinces.

                                       of so busy a life. The gold hair band and bag pleased me immensely. I have a
                                       black evening frock with which I wear a gold coat so you see your gifts
                                       provide the perfect accessories. You know peacocks are anathema to the
                                       superstitious. Is this a challenge to me to rule my stars and ignore timid
                                       inhibitions and safety policy? I've already broken two mirrors and I'm dying
                                       to flaunt this golden peacock abroad. But they are incredibly lovely birds.
                                       Sometimes the things that have become banal in literature, as roses and

            <p><a name="d0e5152"></a>Mr. Nicholls has just telephoned me he has a letter from you today but he's
                                       working like a Trojan and will be late again tonight so I'll not see it
                                       until morning. I told Deirdre what you said about the battle between the
                                       light and the dark making all the colors. She loves it. At sunset time in
                                       the excitement of so much color she waves her arms vigorously saying "plash,
                                       plash" and does twice around the lawn to give bodily expression to the
                                       thrill. I was too amused to be annoyed today when Deirdre came and announced
                                       that - "I swallowed an egg down the sink." I investigated and found a broken
                                       shell on the drain board and realized that the contents had disappeared down
                                       the plug hole of the sink. "Swallowed" was an apt term for the pause and
                                       then the disappearance in one gulp of a good fresh egg down the sink pipe.
                                       You have stressed this early period for the training of all the senses
                                       giving wide experience to all of them. I have been lightly directing her
                                       attention to scents and she has responded readily, our own scented gum, the
                                       leaves of the scented angophora by the Johnston's gate, the big leaved
                                       wattle on the lawn, a verbena and just now jasmine. All these she knows and
                                       others too like freshly out paw-paw, pineapples and lately we had
                                       strawberries. I said, "We'll wait till Edgar comes before eating them." She
                                       said, "But may I smell them till Edgar comes?" which meant I hadn't the
                                       heart to refuse and if a few did disappear it was hardly by conscious
                                       decision on her part but a nose-hand-mouth reaction that went off on its own
                                       accord. One can't wallop a kid for that.

            <p><a name="d0e5187"></a>A fire broke out near the golf links on Sunday - a hot day and a breeze
                                       blowing. Deans and Nicholls worked like Trojans at it and put it out. They
                                       really were tireless. They packed me back when I arrived in overalls with a
                                       rake on my shoulder. Nicholls said I'd be more nuisance falling over
                                       precipices and such and that this wasn't the Spanish war. So they drank the
                                       tea I'd brought and scrambled back to finish their difficult task. There's
                                       not so much destroyed so do not be apprehensive. Your garden here is looking
                                       very well. The mesembrianthemums at the gate are a blaze of color and the
                                       gate painted green adds to the picture. The bottlebrush above the bamboos
                                       are blooming, a very fine leaved small orange one is particularly lovely.
                                       The lawn does not get much chance - there is such a traffic of children over
                                       it. Many honey-eaters come to the callistemons. The children have just come
                                       for crumbs to throw to them and at the moment all are quiet and pensive
                                       sitting on the lawn watching them. I would like to send you a living picture
                                       of them. We are on the track of another house to be built at Roseville. The
                                       woman is meeting Mr. Nicholls tomorrow and seeing the Pratten houses. The
                                       second Pratten house is now finished and is very lovely - that warm stone
                                       and settled down on the earth (battered walls) as if it was connected with
                                       the Earth's live center - not an accretion like all the houses around. I
                                       would like to show it to you - like a bulb that has flowered in your
                                       absence. But then - you created the bulb! How do you do it? To quote Ron

            <p><a name="d0e5198"></a>book by Cecil Grey called "Predicaments, on Music and the Future."
                                           <a name="141"></a> [Note: "Predicaments; or, Music and the Future" (1936)] It is very
                                       interesting indeed especially when dealing with architecture - the arts
                                       dominating in repeating sequences - "the first to awaken from its slumber
                                       was unquestionably architecture (the spacial <a name="142"></a> [Note: spatial?] art using
                                       the forces of Saturn, the space creator). Then sculpture, painting,
                                       literature, and, in the 19th century, music. Here we have a definite
                                       sequence starting from the 11th century. We are now due for another cycle
                                       starting with architecture."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5207"></a>Today in conformity with Prof. Petrie's theory and with observable fact we
                                       are living in an age dominated by anti-artistic activities such as
                                       mechanics, science, wealth, but already we see emerging from it a new phase
                                       of more purely artistic activity in which Architecture, as in the 11th and
                                       12th centuries, is once more the dominant factor. It follows that in the
                                       immediate future all the arts will aspire toward the conditions of
                                       architecture. Consequently the values which will most probably characterize
                                       the music of the future will be architectural values." And speaking of music
                                       of the future he adds "and the kind of form most likely to characterize this
                                       art is architectural form for architecture as we have seen seems destined to
                                       be the archetype of the immediate future. Architecture, of all the arts, is
                                       the one which is best reconciled into a unity the eternal antithetic duality
                                       of classicism and romanticism. Architecture has been well expressed in the
                                       well known dictum - that architecture is frozen music. The corollary that
                                       music is molten architecture provides the best possible index to the nature
                                       of the musical art which is to come. Its leading place during the coming
                                       period is further strengthened by the fact that of all the arts architecture
                                       is the least nationalistic and this may well be one of the reasons to
                                       account for its almost complete eclipse during the whole of the 19th
                                       century. In the second place it is the most impersonal of all the arts. The
                                       art we are led to visualize then is the one neither classic nor romantic but
                                       partaking of the attributes of both, monumental in style, cosmopolitan

            <p><a name="d0e5335"></a>My solitary journey to Mahmudabad was another novel episode of India. The
                                       roads being impossible for this fifty mile journey, I went by rail
                                       accompanied by the young Rajah's younger brother, the only first class
                                       passengers in the only first class compartment of the train or trams for we
                                       had one change. The trip out took only the afternoon, but the return trip
                                       lasted from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. the delays being at the junction occasioned
                                       by the precarious condition of the mile-long bridge across the Golga, the
                                       most unreliable of Indian rivers in its most erratic season. The altered
                                       channel had been cutting down at one pier from fifteen to seventy five feet
                                       below water level, i.e., to but fifteen feet from the foundation ninety feet
                                       deep. Hence all the passengers on that section of the Bengal North-Western
                                       had to disembark and walk across this part of the bridge to another train.
                                       There is a picturesque sailboat-ferry for other kinds of vehicles. The
                                       Mahmudabad railway station is one of the four villages aggregating 8,000
                                       population which surround the palace separated only by the wide moat on
                                       three sides and by the park into which the moat has been converted on the
                                       entrance front. It has been too recently extended to be altogether charming
                                       and is of the Lucknow version of Mogul architecture with Italian flavoring.

                                       just outside the moat and overlooking a long reach of it. Previously in the
                                       evening I had been taken out a mile or two to a spot alongside a tank where
                                       I am to build a modest cottage for the two brothers converting the pond into
                                       a "paka" swimming pool at the same time. This is so that the Rajah may have
                                       a place he "can call his own" escaping from an existence for all the world
                                       like that of Henry VIII as characterized in the film where Charles Laughton

            <p><a name="d0e5379"></a>The next afternoon we had popcorn for afternoon tea because I had asked about
                                       that kind of Indian corn, and with the help of a compass and a globe we
                                       worked out the bearing of Mecca from Mahmudabad and found that its angle
                                       with the axis of the palace was about 30&deg;. Hence for the Mosque for the
                                       family which I am asked to build, I selected an angle in the wall between
                                       the main compound and the Zenana Court yard for a hexagonal "bastion" mosque
                                       which with its mihrab properly pointed toward Mecca will not clash in its
                                       grouping with the surroundings as does practically every Mosque I have seen
                                       including those adjoining the Exposition I am building and that with which I
                                       have planned the Pioneer building to parallel. It is intended that this

            <p><a name="d0e5403"></a>I agreed to remain a second day for an inspection of the Belahra Palace, 11
                                       miles distant, founded by one of the Rajah's ancestors who was sent by the
                                       Mogul Emperor to subdue this unruly outpost and who did so. His final heirs
                                       are the two sisters to whom the Mohammedan brothers are now married and the
                                       estates henceforth are merged. The original brothers agreed so well on most
                                       everything that they had the same architect for their forts and chose almost
                                       identical furnishings, bric-a-brac, paintings, etc., but Belahra has been
                                       much less added to and has an elevated site and is on that account more
                                       picturesque especially on the side of its ramp approaches. It took half a
                                       day to traverse the various rooms and courts and to appraise the repairs and
                                       alterations necessary to convert this into a Durban <a name="148"></a> [Note: durbar?, i.e., a

                                       at the same time giving to it something more of oldtime character of
                                       fortress than it now has. Can you imagine anything more congenial to me?

                                       brought word that the road was possible for car which proved to be precisely
                                       right. Possibly to preclude any disappointment on my part an elephant
                                       followed on in the afternoon and we set out in a shikar into the surrounding
                                       meadows and marshes, seven of us on the elephant's back with an ox-cart load
                                       of "monskere" - jesters - four footmen and four horsemen - and one

                                       of India is also the President of the United Province Association for the

                                       bagged only a snake, a pigeon and two other birds suitable for the kulis

                                       of range and we did not find anything else, but on viewing the sunset from
                                       the castle on our return, all voted it the end of a perfect day.

                                       sent me. Several people want mine and I won't give it up but they want it so
                                       badly that I fear me they'll pinch it if I let it get out of my hands. Here

                                       tea with Eunice Cameron. Her garden is flourishing with many lovely rock
                                       plants most of which you suggested to her. She offered me cuttings and
                                       roots. I am to go another day because with Halloween on my hands I'd not

                                       our Barbette house is a great success. There were many doubts expressed
                                       about those troughs (carried around the rooms at door and window head height
                                       to conceal lamps completely, lighting the rooms indirectly) but as we
                                       switched the light on for the first time there was great excitement and Mrs.
                                       Guyatt said, "There, don't ever tell me that Walter Burley isn't a genius!"

                                       for a little theatre in Castlecrag to supplement the Valley Theatre. On
                                       Sunday night on this roof Captain Fisk started the ball rolling with slides
                                       of India and Burma - quite delightful. And Helen Morton and Mrs. Evers took
                                       &pound;2-13-0 by way of the nest-egg. On the 24th Professor Brose is giving us a
                                       lecture on Beethoven illustrated (development and form, etc.) by the
                                       Waldstein Sonata. We shall think out other things, not hurriedly - we don't
                                       want to surfeit the people - but whenever anything of special interest
                                       arises then the roof will always be here as a free basis.

                                       article from the pen of Walter Burley Griffin who has achieved such world
                                       wide distinction as an architect, landscape architect and Town Planner; and
                                       to whom we, as wild life conservationists, owe so much for his noble vision
                                       in setting out the original plans of the Federal Capital City of Australia

                                       article. Mr. Griffin and his colleagues are at present setting a great

                                       our use and administration of the land. Each successive stage has been
                                       missing its mark because of the deficient consciousness of a larger organic
                                       element of which it has sooner or later found itself to be but a part.
                                       Comprehensive planning will have to learn from Mother Nature the secret of
                                       growth and equilibrium, and that conservation which contrasts so strikingly
                                       with the devastation, even to desert conditions, that the greatest of man's
                                       civilizations have always left in their wake, and which is proceeding at
                                       accelerating pace in spite of recent pricks of our consciences, and of all

            <p><a name="d0e5515"></a>Castlecrag is an effort toward Land Planning in the fundamental sense of
                                       arranging for that use to which the terrain is most suitable. Land in this
                                       sense is accorded the respect due to a highly developed and perfected living
                                       organism not to be exterminated nor treated as dead material, nor as a mere
                                       section of the map. That part of the Metropolitan Unity which comprises the
                                       natural setting of Sydney has now gone through a metamorphosis throughout
                                       its whole extent, from Botany Bay almost to Broken Bay, so complete that
                                       without the latter's fortunate survival one would scarcely be able to
                                       picture the Sydney of the last century with its then justly famous Harbour.

            <p><a name="d0e5518"></a>In the eighteen-eighties upper Middle Harbour was chosen in advance of the
                                       farther Eastern suburbs, by a far-seeing group, for residential development;
                                       and the monumental Suspension Bridge was built to give access. For this,
                                       however, the Government so positively denied either tramway facilities or
                                       franchise that the bulk of the territory was precluded from occupation until

                                       interest, no control that is not localized in the strictest sense possible,
                                       i.e. personal, has ever yet availed to prevent the disappearance of our wild
                                       life before the advancing population. In the present incipient stage of
                                       general understanding of nature even the best of our organized communities,
                                       authorities and municipalities suffer their reserves to be "improved" or
                                       despoliated, gradually obliterating the natural character. It is only
                                       necessary to stand on some lookout such as Covecrag to be able to
                                       distinguish, from all the rest, primitive spots that are under the care of
                                       considerate owners and are not indiscriminately accessible to the public.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5532"></a>Unfortunately the cases of personal protective interests are exceptional; and
                                       even for these the hazards of bush fires, vandalism, rubbish dumping and
                                       reckless depredation for flowers, plants, firewood, poles, bee-trees,
                                       timber, soil, sand and stones are uninsurable. Notwithstanding these
                                       difficulties and the unsympathetic obstacles of the public authorities, the
                                       restoration to the natural state has already been noticeable in Castlecrag
                                       with a resident community of about two dozen families only, and during the
                                       period of surveys and construction work of many miles of roads and sewers,
                                       as well as playing areas, baths, tennis courts and golf courses besides the
                                       quarrying and housing. These operations have not so appreciably silted up
                                       the coves as in other sections because of the general contour alignment of
                                       the narrow roads, their early sealing and the drainage precautions taken
                                       wherever possible. The placing of the roads and the allocation of the home
                                       sites thus required complete topographical surveys followed by detailed
                                       personal feature-studies in order to determine and to conserve the
                                       distinctive formations and flora.

                                       separate and screen the lots at the garden fronts. In the same way the
                                       roadside and junction groves and thickets screen and make private their
                                       street fronts. Thus in addition to the site individually occupied by a
                                       self-selected nature lover, there is a reserve on two sides over which, as a
                                       contiguous owner, he has an interest through the local Parks Committee of
                                       each neighborhood in which the control of these areas will all ultimately be
                                       vested. At present one Committee administers the Castlecrag reserves -
                                       collecting the ten shillings per year provided for by covenant from each
                                       abutting lot for the expense of upkeep and improvement. Nearly 2,000 native
                                       trees and shrubs have been planted by this means. As the Castlecrag plans
                                       provided for general segregation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic, these
                                       connected reserves will eventually be provided with woodland short-cut paths
                                       and steps with lighting in contradistinction to the circuitous driveways as
                                       required by the gradients, where the land rises in ledges to 330 feet above
                                       the tidewater that washes the shores of these promontories.

                                       country communities. The Castlecrag social will arises from the
                                       consciousness of a unified plan and purpose and provides persuasion and

                                       afford evidence of the personal will or assertiveness that seeks to express

                                       and enclosures. The vernacular practice in this respect is all to the
                                       contrary, in forms that are unnecessarily bulky as well as uncouth, in
                                       colors that are harsh and hot, and in construction that is intolerant of the
                                       proximity of trees or shrubs as with palings <a name="153"></a> [Note: wooden fencing?],
                                       and through the susceptibility of the roofs to fire, climbers or falling
                                       branches and the encouragement afforded by the elevated timber flooring to
                                       roots, white ants and vermin. The typical houses so far exhibit
                                       indestructible construction of stone and concrete with flat impregnable
                                       terrace roofs and natural stone textures which, wherever they are visible at
                                       all, merge with the primitive features and leave the land 100% that rock

                                       Gang meaning the Sultans' district. Interestingly enough, in the original
                                       Town Plan of Lucknow, Couper Road where we have been living is where the
                                       Architects were allocated. Though we can glimpse the surrounding houses from
                                       the street, from the house one sees none of the other buildings. The lawyer
                                       who effected our lease lives next door (an Indian) and is going to give us
                                       lessons in Hindi. Though we have been studying it a bit when a moment
                                       offered we can't say we have made any perceptible progress. Our landlord
                                       lives about two doors away. Am so glad Clarmyra does not find teaching too

                                       is what Miss Drummond says about Mr. Nicholls:- "Mr. Nicholls is a tower of
                                       strength to me and is growing rapidly into Anthroposophy. We often talk over
                                       things at the German restaurant in this building. He does things for me,
                                       quickly and without any ado." - Marion Mahony Griffin to Georgine Mahony

                                       We are not going from bad to worse but from good to better. Our compound
                                       (yard in the Yankee language) is 220 feet by 360 feet with the palace (you
                                       should see it by moonlight) set about half way back. One (not we) drives in
                                       one gate, through the porte-cochere, and out the other gate. Fine trees and
                                       big ones, especially around the border, thickets and hedges, the drive lined
                                       with an informal hedge of "Our Lady of the Night" which fills the air with
                                       perfume as soon as the sun sets though its flower is but a tiny greenish

                                       filling up with people for the Exposition months. One suggestion to move
                                       into a hospital building, empty now, that is to be used as an hostel, so as
                                       to be on the spot for convenience in superintending the Show - a bluff,

                                       advanced a month's rent and then had our check returned as it had already
                                       been rented by another agent, etc.

                                       them were perfectly lovely and insisted there was no urgency about our
                                       getting out. So we set out to hunt something down. We found the boarding
                                       houses filled up for the whole winter, but one told us of an empty house
                                       near by. We went but were told that it was not available so left but as we
                                       were going we saw a young couple drive up in their tonga <a name="155"></a> [Note: "two-wheeled
                                           covered horse cart" from I.2.37] so we went back to see if they
                                       might be willing to go 50,50 on the house. They were not the tenants but
                                       were searching like ourselves and would be glad to have half a house
                                       (credentials exchanged Walt the architect of the Exposition and Mr. Stephens
                                       a Government official). So our tongas <a name="156"></a> [Note: "covered horse cart[s]" from
                                           I.2.37] trailed around together till finally a stray man said he
                                       knew a house that was available and we were led to a different suburb where
                                       all the buildings are palaces in beautiful extensive gardens, the suburb of
                                       the Indian nahwabs <a name="157"></a> [Note: nawabs?] - Sultan Gang.

            <p><a name="d0e5638"></a>The last tenant, a Rajah, had paid Rs. 250 a month rent but they offered it
                                       to us for about half that (The Stevens were at home in the Indian language,
                                       Mrs. Stephens an Anglo-Indian) and it divides perfectly into quarters for
                                       three families, so we took it and have already had an application for the
                                       third apartment but he had too many servants. At present the Stevens are to
                                       occupy the East half, their preference, on the ground floor. We shall use
                                       the great middle entrance and the center room, almost like a court, in
                                       common as a reception room and Walt will use the South-West corner room as
                                       his private office. Our intention is to use the spiral tower stairway and
                                       the suite on the roof for ourselves subletting the other half of the lower
                                       floor. Upstairs is lovely all facing south and opening out to a big roof
                                       terrace. We would be living among the treetops and no house visible anywhere
                                       except the turrets of Butler Palace, our neighbor across the street (for we
                                       are on the corner) a full block away, in its great gardens some two blocks
                                       square. It is one of the notable palaces of Lucknow. Our exterior is spick

            <p><a name="d0e5649"></a>Miss Drummond gave us a vivid picture of the plays but no one has told us who
                                       took the role of Merlin. She was thrilled with Mr. Nicholls' architectural
                                       effects. What a living thing Miss Drummond has made of the Anthro society -
                                       Anthroposophy, that new world conception comparable to that of Copernicus
                                       which succeeded that of the Greek conception of a flat world with the sun
                                       and stars swinging around it - and how wonderfully everyone is taking his
                                       part. Tell her that Walt will write her for this Air Mail the technicalities
                                       for getting possession of one or the other locations for the Little Theatre.
                                       The wording of the function of those reserves gives the Council no rights of
                                       ownership at all. That wording was another of Walt's inspirations for when
                                       that plan was laid down he had no idea of the difficulties there would be in
                                       establishing proper open spaces for community development. For the location
                                       where he had planned the circular building for the kindergarten, which is a
                                       reserve, there would probably have to be a permanent right of entrance. The
                                       building would be one which would qualify as one appropriate to place there.
                                       In the location adjacent to the shops there could be a full title to the
                                       property.

                                       interestingly enough, is the fighting sense. It rouses man to a knowledge of
                                       his battle with the external world. It warns him of danger and awakens his
                                       consciousness to the things that he can enjoy without fear. It is the first
                                       of the five senses which acquaint us with the manifested world, the Solar
                                       system, the world in which the polarities are Life and Death in which world
                                       only could the human being be created, a Being with the power of Free Will.
                                       Through these five senses which arise from the contact or conflict of the
                                       astral with the etheric (smell, taste, seeing, warmth, hearing) the brain
                                       mind - the moon mind - is developed. You see how wisely you are laying the
                                       foundation of her intellect, her reasoning faculty, which is founded on
                                       these five sense perceptions. Afterward if these senses have been well
                                       developed including the hearing which is a transition sense giving us a
                                       knowledge of the inner nature of things, of their soul, then we can, through
                                       the power of our free will, develop in full consciousness other senses - the
                                       Imaginational, the Inspirational and the Intuitional senses - by which we
                                       can perceive things in the supersensible world.

                                       architecture, as I do, to be the clearest index of the undercurrents of
                                       human consciousness, past or present, we can discern two portents.

            <p><a name="d0e5708"></a>2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the

                                       profound statement of Dr. <a name="158"></a> [Note: James H.?] Cousins, omitting his
                                       particular qualifications, "all art is the extroversion of what in religion
                                       is introversion." Here in India materialistic modernism would be unnatural
                                       and the occasional intrusion of it even into the architecture of the
                                       industrial centers are hardly happy.

            <p><a name="d0e5725"></a>As things are, the forces that gave rise to architecture in India are no
                                       longer expressed therein, since it has long been static, and the meticulous
                                       rules that superseded them for ages are breaking down as natural science
                                       subtly undermines religious authority, notwithstanding that the process has
                                       been retarded longest here in the East. The hereditary artistic crafts,
                                       which have kept the oriental more attractive than the occidental scene, are
                                       already becoming dependent upon governmental or other artificial agencies
                                       for their stimulus and cannot be expected to remain affective much longer.
                                       In the case of buildings and groups simple principles, such as symmetry with
                                       axis defined, retain here an authoritative standing which one does not
                                       observe so generally elsewhere. But even so the general run of construction
                                       in the towns is evidently the worst that has ever afflicted them. There has,
                                       indeed, been only the repetition of Saracenic, European and the occasionally
                                       attempted adaptation and revival of historic Hindu forms to contrast with
                                       the vast mass of buildings wherein the disdain for "ideal" has eliminated
                                       the practical architect's craft so that in practice the lion's share of
                                       building is carried on wholly through engineers and the mistris
                                           <a name="159"></a> [Note: foremen, overseers] who are legion. Against both these
                                       currents is set the course for a renaissance which depends upon the
                                       individualized fresh longings and imagination of the people in whom the
                                       impulse has for a long time been dormant.

                                       vitiated thereby. No one need expect a personal inventiveness of individuals
                                       to solve the problems of aesthetics which the academies of traditional art
                                       have failed to work out on a basis of precedence and laws, science and
                                       "orders," for hundreds of years. Yet individuals, in the absence of guilds
                                       and castes, will have to evoke the forms for future buildings in the same

                                       as, in the nineteenth century, devoted composers brought our greatest epoch

                                       But amongst the confusion and visual discord following upon a century of
                                       intensive industrialism the way has not been smooth nor has much progress
                                       been made though interest in the architect's work is growing all over the

                                       that embraced colors. But India appears to have the facilities to develop
                                       such products with the addition of chemical technology to village potteries,
                                       and of producing decorative values at a cost competitive with the ephemeral
                                       Japanese mass-production, which is confined to minor pieces only. It is not
                                       necessary that the status of the handicrafts should be as humble as most
                                       people imagine it to be. So far as artistic products are concerned, Mr.

            <p><a name="d0e5756"></a>With emphasis on the advantages that are unique to handicraft the competition
                                       of the factories can be reduced to a borderland of the less clearly
                                       selective fields of operation. It is not difficult to realize how each
                                       village or district could be brought to take pride in some distinctive
                                       output and how better organization and co-operation could be effected on the
                                       basis of a <u>world-wide economy</u>, not on just that of a
                                       local supply and demand. The results that can be achieved by a little more
                                       individual self-reliance, which educative methods of training could bring
                                       out in the craftsman, are evidenced by the astonishing response of the
                                       indigenous painting art to the new stress on individuality, as shown in the
                                       Art Gallery of the Lucknow Exposition. It is notable, too, that in the local
                                       market certain printed cotton pieces of greater merit than the general run
                                       bring a 100 per cent advance in price. It is of no slight moment to artistic
                                       salvation that fabric designs can be carried out to order without undue
                                       delay or cost. Abroad this possibility has been for many years, and may
                                       still be, limited to carpets from Austria or, with limitations, from China.
                                       Here are gaps wide open for artistic craftsmen and a chance for distinctive
                                       interiors consistent with the character of each owner and his comprehensive
                                       scheme of architecture and decoration.

            <p><a name="d0e5762"></a>Much is being said now and, especially in America, done in educating human
                                       feelings toward a standard of effectiveness and control comparable with that
                                       of our intellects and physiques as developed through modern training. And
                                       far-reaching consequences to the art of living and especially of living
                                       together form the outlet into some form of creative effort of otherwise
                                       futile, or, at their worst, wasteful and destructive emotions. Where
                                       habitual criminals of the deepest dye have been reformed at San Quentin,
                                       California, through the simple expedient of a year of choral singing in the
                                       penitentiary, there is fair prospect for remedial measures with the larger
                                       number of those uncondemned at large. It is probably too much to anticipate
                                       that the progress of our feelings will come

                                       was introduced to and developed by people in all fields, arousing an
                                       intellectual soul and an understanding of the feelings. How natural that the

            <p><a name="d0e5974"></a>The coming scientific approach to architecture is less concerned with the
                                       auspices of the moon's phases or the "aspect" of planets than with the
                                       aspects of the Sun, that medicinal heating and lighting agency whose service
                                       is of so vast importance. It takes note of such unusual phenomena as
                                       earthquakes and requires a knowledge of the character and direction of the
                                       prevailing winds each month of the year. It subordinates even dimensions of
                                       rooms to the matter of repetitional modules for the arrangement and
                                       organization of the building horizontally and vertically, in an inclusive
                                       unit; and the standardization of all the parts therein and the
                                       simplification of construction. It utilizes the local facilities of the
                                       market for economically solving the problems of effective structure and
                                       protective covering.

            <p><a name="d0e5977"></a>But this sort of approach does not overlook those factors of internal
                                       planning that contribute to orderliness, spaciousness and impressiveness, as
                                       well as to convenience and comfort. Nor does it ignore the character and
                                       value of the environment with which the building must not clash if it is not
                                       to lose its permanent value. In many commercial buildings the greatest value
                                       may be that of publicity; in domestic housing the evidence of culture. In
                                       the long run, buildings cannot be arbitrarily dissected and culled from the
                                       surroundings but must stand or fall with them. No great proportion of
                                       buildings at present start from these simplest fundamentals of practice.
                                       When they do, much of the present customs and habits will be sloughed off.
                                       The seasons must be considered and the orientation as well as the type of
                                       construction appropriate to the climate, the fenestration, and in India,
                                       worshippers of the moon, the fear of the Sun must be eliminated.

            <p><a name="d0e5988"></a>In Lucknow, except in the case of preponderant need for working light from
                                       the North, preference might well be given to a north and south major
                                       alignment to minimize the southern aspect of the building, and consideration
                                       of the desirable and undesirable aspects for the winds for cooling and
                                       ventilation or for bearing disagreeable storms, corroborates this
                                       assumption. For the hot season the easterly breezes will be conserved for
                                       the east side and for the cold weather the same side will be sheltered from
                                       the westerly winds, whilst during the monsoon the through currents will most
                                       effectively afford necessary ventilation.

                                       have many advantages in themselves as compared with galleries and they do
                                       permit the light of heaven to reach the rooms. Where this light at times
                                       carries the radiant heat of the sun, the adjustable Venetian blind, outside
                                       the glass, always affords the means of averting this heat without losing the
                                       light or ventilation. Likewise it affords positive rain protection in the
                                       extreme as compared with gallery protection for windows and it has the
                                       advantage of adaptability to all the seasons. Khustatis are rather a
                                       disagreeable expedient for they require incessant attention and shut off the
                                       light and withhold much of the draft. An alternative proposal for the
                                       Lucknow University Library is a modern gauze curtain, Rui Tati, rolled along
                                       water pipes perforated to give an adjustable drip on the windward side when
                                       the curtain is rolled down and a valve opened. This is a special case where
                                       the greatest difficulty will be in the hot dry season and where the bands of
                                       the roof windows offer a ready receptacle.

                                       for which fibrous magnesium oxychloride composition affords most effective,
                                       and at the same time permanent, insulation, an advantage which the more
                                       expensive cork surpasses only by 10 per cent. As India is a source of all
                                       the ingredients for such composition for the world outside, these
                                       insulations may well become a field for mass production. Incorporated in
                                       cellular roof slab construction, it is doubtful if the extra cost would be
                                       an appreciable factor in the cost of the house. It may be possible
                                       ultimately to come to insulated houses entirely of this material in a
                                       tessellated form of masonry such as the writer has been employing for 20
                                       years in Australia where Portland cement is the sufficiently protective
                                       building material. The mass of structural material is thereby reduced to a
                                       trifling fraction of the accepted type of masonry construction so that the
                                       volume of the materials amounted to one fifth of the entire bulk of the
                                       houses themselves and the two simple structural units lend themselves to an
                                       infinitude of combination for architectural effect. The walls, assembled
                                       rather than laid, had the advantage of producing precision, and the
                                       sincerity of their cut-stone-like structural finish, which needed no film
                                       nor plastic coating inside or out, gave them a solidity and permanence not
                                       obtainable with bricks and mortar or plaster.

                                       Marion Mahony Griffin - This morning there was a meeting to discuss
                                       kindergarten for the children, objections to a regular kindergarten teacher
                                       - too formal; to joining one near by - too many children and don't like
                                       Willoughby environment after Castlecrag; the mothers to divide the days
                                       among themselves - too haphazard, no continuity of place or person in
                                       charge. We talked for an hour and then Mrs. Trinick, in my absence from the
                                       room, suggested that I take it on they paying me enough to free me a bit
                                       from household chores. So that is on for trial. I do hope you approve. Edgar
                                       was somewhat staggered when I met him at the gate with the news. But it's
                                       really not much more than we have already, for Deirdre usually collects for
                                       the day four or five children before breakfast and as I tuck her in at night
                                       she gets quite pathetic and says, "I've got no children to play with." A
                                       fire broke out in Castlecrag last week. It was put out but we had to watch
                                       it for two days to prevent fresh outbreaks from smoldering logs, etc.
                                       Nicholls and Deans are fine chaps. At first our hearts sank into our boots
                                       but I think now most of it will be recovered before you get back. With love

                                       anniversary so please accept our affectionate greetings and felicitations
                                       and wishes for many happy returns of the day. On the 24th we will plant a

                                       dawn. Deirdre, ever anxious for a celebration, will doubtless greet the news
                                       that - "Today is Mr. Griffin's birthday" with "Shall we have a party?" We'd
                                       like to include a wish for a speedy return but then, after all, it's your
                                       birthday and it's for you that we should be invoking the Gods,

                                       they have landed us all on the earth at the same time. (Nothing less than
                                       the earth is your home. It is not the case of the "homeless wanderer" for
                                       you are everywhere at home.) Really the gods are such capable managers of
                                       human affairs that it is sad that they should be resigning in our favor,
                                       leaving us to run our own shows consciously. We're pretty sure to make a

                                       Your birthday - a most auspicious day. Now you both are celebrating by going
                                       to a cinema am I right? Yesterday began the new kindergarten nursery group
                                       here. A particularly happy and successful beginning it was too. Nine
                                       children were brought by their parents punctually at 9:30 all freshly washed
                                       and brushed and each with a packet of play lunch. I had a fine collection of
                                       new toys and each child as he came in immediately pounced on one or the
                                       other of these and the parents' last minute instructions to "be good and
                                       remember to wipe your nose" were lost in a rising babel of hammering and
                                       shunting and bouncing intermingled with squeals as to who got what first.
                                       They are a particularly fine lot of children and I am enjoying them
                                       immensely.

                                       and Julius free play on the lawn with a big 16" diameter ball and
                                       wheel-barrows, scooters, etc., things that call into play the big muscles,
                                       while the older ones work inside at tables. Then we sit around cross-legged
                                       in a circle and eat play lunch all together and with considerable ceremony.
                                       Then a game of follow the leader. Annette took them down the slippery slide,
                                       she did not spring up quickly enough on reaching the bottom and the
                                       following two or three banked up on top of her and there was a wild scramble
                                       of legs and arms. Deirdre left her

                                       children, they are helpful and encouraging. One needs an endless fund of

                                       round and the tragic truth had to be faced, Kaaren gathered up the limp
                                       cicada and with flashing eyes and firm step she marched off with "I will
                                       take it home and put new life in it." Deirdre and Kaaren are the best of
                                       friends but temperamentally they are poles apart. Deirdre tumbles about the
                                       lawn doing all kinds of physical contortions in sheer sensuous enjoyment and
                                       chuckling with laughter. Kaaren joins saying, "Oh yes Deirdre, we must be
                                       having some fun on the lawn." Then seeing me watching them she says to me -
                                       "This is the time when we must be doing our exercises" as though to dispel
                                       any idea of her indulging in any emotional abandon. I wanted to tell you of

                                       the King's marrying an American ask Father Griffin. We talked over the
                                       possibility several years ago when he and Mother Griffin were with us in
                                       Melbourne at dinner at the Lippincotts - the easiest way for Britain to get
                                       the U.S. back into the "empire." It made him so mad he couldn't eat his
                                       desert. However I don't think this marriage has been made according to the
                                       plan laid down. Theodore Roosevelt's daughter was the one under discussion.
                                       Only the Gods removed that threat when he was the Wilson opponent.

                                       It happened this way. Saturday I was lunching at the Deans' when two chaps
                                       knocked at the door, having been sent there by the Castlecrag grocer in
                                       whose shop they were having a drink as a refresher after spending the
                                       morning walking the foreshores from suspension bridge to us, a continuation
                                       of their intermittent search for a waterfront lot. One of the two remembered
                                       me as a fellow student at the Victoria Art Gallery some 20 years ago. The
                                       brother had met Edgar Deans' brother so no introductions were needed. I
                                       remembered well a shy lad commencing art to whom I magnanimously gave
                                       Ruskin's "Elements of Drawing," and this same chap had always harbored an
                                       appreciative spot for me as a consequence. Now a commercial artist he has
                                       his own business here and owns a launch, and one look at the above lot and I
                                       could see that he was satisfied. We went the rounds but came back to this
                                       lot. The next Saturday the deposit was paid and they are going to begin
                                       forthwith to build a house. He already had a flat roofed house in mind and
                                       wanted a native garden so all is simple so far. Both he and his sister are
                                       interested in Anthroposophy and have considerable knowledge of the
                                       Aboriginals and their occult knowledge, so are fair prospects for
                                       Anthroposophy. He had quite a chat at my house on Sunday when Miss Drummond
                                       and the others popped in on their return from the Nativity play rehearsal
                                       down at the theatre.

                                       but none where the proprietor has got so much real value for his money.
                                       Eric's garden is all in an advanced state and the sunken garden which
                                       continues the long axis of the house is stocked with some couple of hundred

            <p><a name="d0e6290"></a>Spirit is that which creates. All efficiency derives from free spirit. Man is
                                       spirit. His capacity to do, to conceive, to create has no limits. Putting
                                       spirit in bondage brings illness and death to his body and soul. The
                                       inspired slogan of the French Revolution was Liberty, Equity, Fraternity.
                                       The 18th century established in the United States a political organization,
                                       based on the control by the majority, to establish and maintain <u>EQUITY</u>. By what means can we attain Liberty in addition
                                       to Equity? Obviously by establishing a social organization whose function

            <p><a name="d0e6301"></a>is to maintain <u>Liberty</u>. Such an organization would have to
                                       include all the citizenry as the Equity organization does. But could it
                                       function through the decisions of a majority? Obviously not, but only
                                       through an instrument which makes it possible for each individual to
                                       determine and use his own abilities in his own way. This organ, to attain
                                       its end, must be able to place the means, for ability to function, in this
                                       realm and not in the political realm whose natural interest is not in
                                       ability but in equity. Men cannot be equal in their abilities - no two men's
                                       abilities are alike. So the nature of this organization will be the polar
                                       opposite of that of the Political organ. It cannot function by means of a
                                       majority vote. So to attain democracy we must free our Political organ from
                                       the task of concerning itself with questions of Liberty, watching out only
                                       for equity (like the traffic officer). Land rentals which belong to the
                                       community (if we can say land "belongs" to humans in any true sense) as a
                                       whole could well meet the needs of this organization. Imagination and
                                       inspiration can flourish and become effective only through an <u>Abilities Organ</u> which would assure its free play and see to it
                                       that every individual has full opportunity to develop his abilities
                                       throughout his life.

                                           <a name="170"></a> [Note: Harold J. Laski?], a self-confident young Britisher, in
                                       Yale. When questions were being put by the audience, I asked if it would not
                                       be a great step toward solving world problems he was discussing if the form
                                       of the British Empire were so altered. He said that you could never bring
                                       that about, and then seeing the Irish in my face he flung back - "Ireland
                                       would never stand for that." But interestingly enough within these last few
                                       years Ireland has done that very thing and has accomplished the step in that
                                       direction for the Empire. It would be no more difficult for each of the
                                       others to do the same.

            <p><a name="d0e6339"></a>Because of the threat of Ireland's being used as a take-off for an attack on
                                       England, de Valera was able to establish the complete freeing of Irish
                                       affairs from interference from England; and Ireland accepts no titles (the
                                       cheapest form of bribery). Then later, after a new king was crowned, Ireland
                                       of her own free will as an act of Parliament accepted this king as the king
                                       of Ireland to function so in matters that were of common concern to all the
                                       British units. So there already exists a federation of Britain and Eire and
                                       it has so functioned during the present war though much misunderstood by the
                                       general public. Ireland is now in a position to attain what she first
                                       desired - a congressional form of government.

                                       accomplished the menace of Britain would be gone - the British federation
                                       could carry out its natural function of breaking down boundaries and Germany
                                       and the rest of the world would no longer need to resort to violence in

                                       Maddocks - Walt says if I'm to get in on those January sales I'd better
                                       reply to your letter immediately so it's on his head if more curses fall on
                                       him for lack of finished drawings. There's one thing I would like to have
                                       though I've got my nerve to suggest it but if you will put temptation before
                                       me, a pyjama gown cut on the pattern of Mrs. Nicholls' red one. When
                                       mosquito season is on the only costume that makes life endurable is the
                                       pyjama with long wide legs and wide flowing sleeves and light colored ones
                                       are no good here. That red smock you sent me is perfect. Those we bought,
                                       the linen colored ones, are dirtier in two hours than they would be in two
                                       months in Castlecrag. My goodness, you folks should appreciate dustless
                                       Castlecrag. Within three days of the Monsoon, everything is covered with a
                                       fine red or black dust which at this season one doesn't notice in the
                                       atmosphere but you couldn't drop a handkerchief and use it after picking it
                                       up. It would be spotted with patches of stain which won't shake off,
                                       wherever it touched anything. So gaudy rich colors are the thing. They call
                                       the Indians dirty but it takes more than any ordinary washing to get these
                                       stains out and no wonder the poorer one's clothes usually look very rusty.
                                       One day I watched with interest (as I was sitting in a car waiting for Walt
                                       to come out of the Exposition office) an Indian come to a well a hundred or
                                       so feet away, dip his pail and take a full bath with the utmost modesty and
                                       greater cleverness than any movie film actor, never exposing his body at
                                       all, screened always by his sari like scarf over which he finally threw a
                                       clean one dropping the one he had been wearing to the ground and then
                                       proceeding to wash it. It was very interesting. The fact that it was right
                                       out in a public highway didn't concern him at all. Naturally the clothes he
                                       was wearing got well soaked as he poured a pailful of water down his back.

            <p><a name="d0e6388"></a>of the mischief Walt has been in. The day before he had to go to Cawnpore for
                                       a miserable committee meeting of the Exposition for finalizing the accounts
                                       of the contractor, all perfectly useless as it was all hanky-panky. The
                                       meeting was closed just five minutes after a train had left so he had three
                                       hours on his hands which he spent walking. Perhaps this was the last straw
                                       which ruptured the walls of the gall bladder so we can lay that up against
                                       the miserable Exposition coterie though that doesn't wash with
                                       Anthroposophists who know that nothing happens by chance but all in
                                       accordance with one's own decisions so one can really feel no bitterness
                                       about anything that happens. It is really amazing to be able to see things
                                       that way. However one is tempted to quote a favorite saying of Roy
                                       Lippincott's "I wish them no harm but I hope they choke."

                                       most important things at present is for Europeans and Indians to learn to
                                       understand each other. In carrying out the plan you suggest we both think
                                       you would certainly be doing your bit in that great work.

                                       along too. For years Walt always went to sleep at the readings. Mrs.
                                       Williams wouldn't let anybody make fun of him and said he learned more while
                                       asleep than most of the ones who kept awake. And there is almost no one who
                                       can remember and quote anything that has been read during the evening. The
                                       matter really doesn't belong in the memory realm but it gradually soaks in
                                       and becomes a part of yourself. Mrs. Cummings should go too. I got a lovely
                                       letter from her and am delighted at the possibility of her coming to India.
                                       Mrs. Prescott, tell your husband to be sure to go to see some of the
                                       Eurythmy performances given in London. I have a notion he would think it a

                                       school work and we concentrated on the work of our private clients. From the
                                       domestic point of view we were revolutionaries as except for the Child of
                                       Heaven Harijan, who disposed of our sewage, and the gardener who was part of
                                       the estate, the Mrs. did her own house work. With breakfast over, a four
                                       story double boiler was filled with the next meal and taken into the
                                       drafting room where it could be stoked with coke when needed.

                                       Mohsin (Mohammedan) superintendent, and Marion Mahony Griffin with an
                                       occasional experiment in a draftsman, drove out the private work which was
                                       coming in from all sides even to that last day of his life when a Raja
                                       appeared who had just acquired 10,000 acres at the foot of the Himalayas and
                                       who wanted him to develop it. It was a happy and busy office and we learned
                                       how completely false is the usual American conception of India. Oh! they'll
                                       outwit you if they can in the matter of paying their bills but that's a part
                                       of their clever way of getting rid of Britishers, in addition to having
                                       almost completely manned the bureaucracy with Indians when they found how
                                       easy it is to bribe officials. Only by pulling off this last war in which
                                       Chamberlain was an implement were the consequences of that postponed. There
                                       was complete friendliness between the members of the two great religions. It

                                       we realized the difference in dress nothing in their relationships was
                                       evident to reveal any distinction in the young students' feelings toward
                                       each other, and they called me their "little mother," I suspect because I
                                       scolded them. Now Halder and Mohsin eat their lunches together on the

                                       inclined to join me we would have carried on but when he decided not to come
                                       over I realized that it was probably for the best since he did not have a
                                       University degree and that was the first question asked by those whom I
                                       talked with concerning his coming over. One Architectural firm offered me a
                                       partnership and the Technical school wanted me as a teacher. But nobody
                                       could really have stepped into Mr. Griffin's boots so I did what I could to
                                       meet the urgent needs of the clients and prepared to return to Sydney.

                                       stepped indirect light standards cut diagonally across the square of the
                                       canopy with flower boxes at their bases giving mystery and color to the
                                       whole. The upper half of the pyramid forms the protecting roof for the
                                       statue which is heroic in dimensions. The statue itself is a fine piece of
                                       work and is illuminated by indirect lighting from the molded shelves from
                                       which the interior vaults spring. Broad flights of stairs lead to the
                                       entrances on the four sides. It is a very radical, a truly revolutionary
                                       design.

                                       the approval of the design by the chairman in charge. So we planned together
                                       what we should say. We took it to his office. Mr. Chowdray said:- "We have
                                       come to present the sketch design for acceptance." There was a statue of

                                       "I accept it." Mr. Chowdray and I looked at each other. There was evidently
                                       nothing more to be said. So to break the silence Mr. Chowdray asked if he
                                       would like to have a model made and he said "Yes." So that was that.

                                       Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - I'm afraid my last letter sounded rather
                                       flippant what with the "Hope they choke" etc. coming just after you had
                                       received the cable, but it was written on that fourth day when everything
                                       seemed to be going so well. Saturday after the operation I sat by Walt's bed
                                       through the night. What a pity you couldn't have been here to help nurse
                                       him. He waked at about five quietly with no sign of pain. At about seven I
                                       started home. I expected to pick up a tonga <a name="180"></a> [Note: "covered horse cart" from
                                           I.2.37] along the way but at that time in the morning there were
                                       none so I walked the five miles home. It was a pleasant walk in the early
                                       morning quite a bit of it along the river bank, and I didn't mind it a bit.
                                       A few days before, Walter had taken pencil sketches of the Mahmudabad
                                       Library over to show the Rajah who was delighted with the scheme. He
                                       promised a rendered perspective for the Monday morning following. So on my
                                       arrival home I put in a long day on that and then had a good night's sleep,
                                       was up early Monday morning and worked on the drawing (the men in the office
                                       had gone over to see Walt Sunday afternoon) till one o'clock and was just
                                       putting on the last wash when they came - two men and the Rajah. It was the
                                       first time I had seen them though he had invited me to come over with Walt
                                       but I had put my time on the drawing instead. He is a very charming young
                                       man, very unassuming, reminded very much of Glanville Smith which will mean
                                       something to Florence Birch and Miss Leeson. He took off the drawing and I
                                       bustled around over a few things and then went over to the hospital. The
                                       first thing Walt asked me was if I had written to you. I had to say I hadn't

                                       work, calculations, demanding answers and when I gave him figures he heard
                                       me for he took them up and went on from there. And then quiet again. As the
                                       end drew near I talked to him telling him what a wonderful life I had had
                                       with him, how he was beloved by everybody, and suddenly he turned as if with
                                       a great effort and looked straight in my eyes, his own wide, round, startled
                                       as if it had never once occurred to him that he could die. His eyes never
                                       left mine till he drew his last breath and I closed them.

            <p><a name="d0e6532"></a>A few months ago after I had several times said we must take time to go over
                                       to the bank together and get my name on the account, I finally said to him
                                       that we must go, that his Mars was in the 8th house which meant death
                                       through accident and that if something happened to him the very fact of my
                                       not having access to money might cause his death. He said but you never told
                                       me that, well naturally one wouldn't. Anyway, he said, that won't happen, my
                                       Mars is well aspected. I replied that had nothing to do with the case,
                                       whatever the aspects, Mars in 8 meant just that. The next day we went to the
                                       bank. After the decision for the operation he turned to me and said, "A pity
                                       that Mars is in the 8th House isn't it." I brushed it aside and said,
                                       "That's a long way off," and we both brushed the idea out of our minds. He
                                       didn't want to go. Things were pouring in here and he was very happy. There
                                       was a beautiful notice in the Pioneer about him which I'll send when I get a

                                       that Mr. Griffin and he met on the road on the bank of the River Gumti, that
                                       Mr. Griffin was very joyous, very joyous, and had said many things to him
                                       but that mostly he could not remember them,

                                       message to me saying to Mr. Mohsin "Be sure to remember." In Mr. Mohsin's
                                       words to me - "You must lead an active life." One might think I had earned a
                                       holiday but that answer to my call to him is more convincing than a dream of
                                       my own could be and seems also that perhaps I should stay here. I am
                                       awaiting what Mr. Nicholls says about coming over as I can't see how my work
                                       here could be useful unless he was here too.

            <p><a name="d0e6549"></a>I have had many loving cables and two very lovely ones from the Australian
                                       Government. I can see Dr. Maloney's hand in them with his great power of

                                       have a chance to write to him. He did send a booklet of the Exposition to
                                       Mr. James Alexander Smith but I have not yet written to him of Walter's

            <p><a name="d0e6552"></a>Tell Mr. Nicholls that the blue prints of the Paper Mill sent by ordinary
                                       mail arrived today. It was under Mr. Mohsin's clever instructions and
                                       watchful eye that I was able to collect our fees for that job. Also with our
                                       Judge client. Mr. Mohsin insisted on taking over the bill himself and had me
                                       put at the bottom of it - Mr. Mohsin sign here. He presented the bill to the
                                       Judge who said the equivalent of our "right oh" and started to retire. But
                                       Mr. Mohsin said, "But I must have the money or Mrs. Griffin will think I
                                       have stolen it." "Oh," said the judge and gave him the money which he signed
                                       for. Really I think a large part of the decline in the number of Englishmen
                                       who are coming to India these days is because the Indians have decided to
                                       pay none of their bills, as well as by the fact that with judicious bribery
                                       Indians have replaced almost all of the British in the Civil Service.

            <p><a name="d0e6576"></a>Mr. Griffin's influence on urban architecture took place not only from his
                                       general practice but also from a unique incident. When the competition was
                                       called for the Tribune Building in Chicago <a name="181"></a> [Note: Tribune Tower, 1922],
                                       the eight members of the Melbourne office worked jointly and sent a set of
                                       drawings which like those of Mr. Saarinen of Finland arrived too late for
                                       adjudication. Even if they had been there we think the job would still have
                                       gone as it did to a charming set of drawings and a harmonious adaptation of
                                       Gothic motives to this Tower building, but the erection of this building
                                       marked, as if time had been cut with a knife, the close of a copy book
                                       architecture in the U.S. and the establishment of creative design in city
                                       buildings.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6582"></a>Interestingly enough it was Mr. Saarinen who won the second prize in the
                                       Australian Federal Capital competition with a set also of exquisite drawings
                                       and a plan full of soul but not so rich in the solution of problems - not
                                       dominated by the <u>Spirits of Mathematics</u> (utterly
                                       different from mechanical).

            <p><a name="d0e6588"></a>A book of all designs submitted was published and probably every architect in
                                       Chicago has it. With Walter's was sent a statement that in city buildings
                                       the structure should not be handled as an individual thing striving to hold
                                       its own by its individuality of character but that the fact should be
                                       recognized that the essential character of a city building was that it was
                                       necessarily a parallelepipedon and that it should be handled simply as a
                                       detail in the whole of the city. The two town planners recognized this and
                                       in the minor motives took up this form and played with it. In the other
                                       designs you felt either the effort to adapt old forms or to be original the
                                       latter being mostly grotesque. When a problem is solved it is inescapable.
                                       Walter, the more conscious of the two of underlying principles, stated the
                                       nature of the solution of the problem in both drawing and words. The Tribune
                                       building was scarcely built when along the Wacker Drive, within sight of it,
                                       a whole series of buildings with the sure touch of the creative designer,
                                       very beautiful, were erected, different architects but all harmonious, each

                                       the Tribune building, not because of its size but because of its character,
                                       look like a plaything. As you stand there you see the close of the past era
                                       in architecture and the opening of the new. New York swiftly followed. I saw

                                       husband, your love sending happy thoughts, that I cried over. It came as I
                                       was getting up in the morning and I had a good self-pitying cry, filled also
                                       with the thought that after a lifetime of self sacrifice Walter seemed to be
                                       just on the point of gathering the fruits. It did me good I think but it
                                       lasted only a short time when your happy thoughts poured in and took
                                       possession.

            <p><a name="d0e6614"></a>In India I was talking over with Mr. Mohsin, who is a Mohammedan, an
                                       unfortunate incident which happened in connection with the celebration of a
                                       Hindu festival....The young folk came to the office with their clothes
                                       bespattered with red stains, symbolic of blood. To the Mohammedans this was
                                       contamination and a boy had been killed. I told him that if one part of a
                                       community felt like that the other part ought not to indulge in this game
                                       for it was in the nature of our Halloween frolics for all its religious
                                       significance. Each should be able to cross the boundaries of his own way of

            <p><a name="d0e6635"></a>One afternoon I invited Mr. Mohsin's wife and daughter to afternoon tea. They
                                       came in true Indian fashion in tonga <a name="184"></a> [Note: "covered horse cart" from
                                       I.2.37] with curtains drawn, themselves completely veiled in their
                                       formal cylindrical garment dropping from a disc on their heads and only two
                                       holes for their eyes. They took off these outer garments when they came but
                                       when I suggested walking across the veranda to the spiral stairs to the
                                       upper quarters on the roof, on went the veils again. When we sat down in our
                                       little kitchen-dining room (which from the Indian point of view were a bath
                                       and dressing room) for simplifying my own work, I was surprised to learn
                                       that Mr. Halder was not to be permitted to eat with us so I took tea,
                                       scones, cakes and various goodies in to the drafting room for him. Afterward
                                       he went with us as planned to a picture show which is helping to break down
                                       the custom of the veil since our two gentlemen taking their place back of
                                       us, the ladies sat in the audience room unveiled.

            <p><a name="d0e6641"></a>When I came to arrange for leaving India, I asked Mr. Mohsin if his daughter
                                       would use my bicycle if I gave it to her, for Lucknow has no trams nor
                                       buses, nor motor cars on hire. I chatted with him about the importance of
                                       giving girls an opportunity to earn their own living in case of emergencies,
                                       suggesting laughingly that he should make modern women of them. He talked
                                       the matter over with his family and the next morning said his daughter would
                                       love to have the bicycle so he took it over to her. I shouldn't be surprised
                                       at all if she rode it still in her flowing robes and veil. I have seen a
                                       number of Hindu girls on bicycles but never a veiled Mohammedan.

            <p><a name="d0e6644"></a>In those last weeks one afternoon I slipped into my living quarters and slept
                                       for an hour. When I came back Mr. Mohsin looked at me with anxious eyes and
                                       asked me if I was not feeling well. I told him I was just tired and had
                                       taken a nap. He said, "This is the first time you have ever done that." Of
                                       course the siesta is very common practice in India. In those last days he
                                       said - "You are so lovely. You have such a lovely

                                       Perkins] had ever known.) And he told me that never before had he seen
                                       such benevolence, not even in their religious leaders. He did not mean
                                       charity for that did not enter our lives there. He meant "Well wishing" and
                                       I understood him. In his really elegant English he used words carefully.
                                       Through well wishing we can cross all boundaries. We can free all people
                                       from their bondage to material things if to well-wishing we add correct
                                       concepts. A friend once told me I had the saddest eyes she had ever seen
                                       except those of one man, one who had spent his life solving the problems
                                       necessary to save humanity of our time by correct concepts and definite
                                       action. That sadness which comes from what we see does not indicate a
                                       sadness of spirit when one has contacted those clear concepts and so can see
                                       the way out of the morass we are in.

                                       time this reaches you a whole eternity will have passed or been lived
                                       through since your overwhelming experience of parting with your great
                                       companion. Yet I must tell you how deeply grieved we were and how we were
                                       filled with sorrow at every remembrance of the sudden and almost
                                       unbelievable news. The fact that life had held so many difficulties for him
                                       added to the pain. I hated to think too of the great slogging heavy,
                                       workingman's jobs he had tackled here in connection with the theatre and its
                                       plays; and how he had not been recognized here; and of the loss to the
                                       world. Sorrow on sorrow mounted up involuntarily - Then there was the
                                       painful thought of your utter desolation and agony in those first hours. We
                                       went from one friend to another in our dismay to find that the same distress
                                       prevailed and anxiety for you. So long it seemed before your first air mail
                                       letter came to Mrs. Maddocks and to Mr. Nicholls from which to hear any word
                                       from you. But since then there has been the great comfort of knowing that
                                       you would not have us think of you as grieving.

            <p><a name="d0e6685"></a>Dear Mrs. Griffin, Just this morning after receiving your cable, did Packie
                                       ring me and we together were overwhelmed by the appalling loss the world,
                                       yes the world, we here and you in particular have suffered in Walter's
                                       death. His last letter to me, written between what he thought were stomach
                                       attacks, had in a way worried me, but the suddenness of the final news
                                       leaves me virtually expressionless and stunned. How can it be so? The
                                       question goes round and round in my mind. I will eventually realize it is
                                       the sad truth, but from our human point I cannot comprehend he is gone from
                                       us, just vanished from our mundane lives. As you well know, both you and he
                                       have supplied the aim and direction of my life and have become so much a
                                       part of it that I cannot yet visualize the future without Mr. Griffin. I
                                       seem to have counted on him for the next thirty years or so. And you - the
                                       isolation and utter loneliness - a lump comes in my throat every time I
                                       think of you. I trust you can find some solace in the thought that you were
                                       favored for so long, to know him so well. He was the most unique person I
                                       ever had the privilege to know, and one out of whom creative forces flowed
                                       so abundantly. I could fill pages with questions of the future. You know I
                                       am ever at your service. Please let me know what needs you have or help you
                                       want and their fulfillment will be a privilege. I will write Molly and I am
                                       sure she will write you directly. She is in Melbourne awaiting the arrival
                                       in about a week's time of another soul to this earth. Our written sympathies
                                       are poor props I feel but I send them fully and freely. I am daily thankful
                                       that fate so favored me as to have brought me under your joint influence
                                       which has been the dominant impulse of my life.

                                       Association, of whom Mr. Griffin had said to me that he was the ideal

            <p><a name="d0e6699"></a>He was always patient, calm, courteous - even to those who wronged him.
                                       Unlike most men he never looked back nor was he ever daunted in his
                                       objectives by the severest obstacles and difficulties. It was only those who
                                       did not know him that said hard things about him and tried to hinder him in
                                       his purposes. But those who like myself were privileged to know him well he
                                       himself - W.B. Griffin - will always remain a shining light in the blackness
                                       - an example and an inspiration.

                                       according to the plans his brain fashioned - but also in the lives of folks
                                       like yourself who were wise enough to see the beauty of his soul and to
                                       build into your lives a design by Walter Burley Griffin more beautiful than
                                       even the tower of Newman College. There can be no question that he was a
                                       poet of a type that is very rare nowadays.

                                       draftsmen had gone than wee Hazel, not yet five, brought me in a bouquet
                                       from the garden and took me in charge. Then we would prepare my supper
                                       together and she would feed me like a baby spooning it into my mouth. She
                                       solved the problem of cracking nuts by shutting the door on them held near
                                       the hinges. Once she brushed the shells off the table onto the floor,
                                       accustomed to many servants in the house, I said - "See here don't you do
                                       that. You deliberately brushed them onto the floor!" She looked at me
                                       severely and said - "Did you say I deliberately brushed then off?" - "Yes I
                                       did." - "Don't you ebber say that to me again," she said. I didn't. Neither

                                       companionship with friends and co-workers had to be broken. Now I left
                                       Castlecrag, truly a bit of Paradise on Earth, to take on the next adventure,
                                       the return to the land where I was born to put my shoulder to the wheel of
                                       molding the destiny of my country, to break down its boundaries in Economic
                                       thinking, to transform it, the only democratic community in the world, into
                                       a wholesome community, into a form which would make possible the solution of
                                       problems as they arose, as the body of the human being itself continually
                                       solves its ever rising problems through its threefold organization:- the
                                       brain organization, the heart organization and the stomach organization.

            <p><a name="d0e6867"></a>It was a fortunate chance for The Pioneer that brought Mr. Walter Burley
                                       Griffin to Lucknow. Ever since the move in July 1933, the paper had been
                                       produced under great difficulties in hired premises and the location of the
                                       Job Department, also in hired premises almost a mile away, was a serious
                                       obstacle to co-ordination and efficient supervision. To gather the whole of
                                       the enterprise together again under one roof as soon as possible was
                                       obviously desirable and for some time a search had been in progress for a
                                       suitable site. The finding of such a site, midway between the telegraph
                                       office and the railway station, near enough to a main road for business
                                       purposes but far enough back from it to escape noise and dust, and only a
                                       stone's throw from the Council Chamber, coincided with Mr. Griffin's arrival
                                       and the opportunity of taking advantage of his skill was too good to be
                                       missed. He had been asked to submit plans for the new Library for Lucknow
                                       University and these having been approved, he came from Australia to
                                       supervise the erection of the building early in 1936.

            <p><a name="d0e6870"></a>A graduate of the University of Illinois, Mr. Griffin was a pioneer of the
                                       town planning movement and was building "modern" houses long before the
                                       modernism of Corbusier and the German school was heard of. When the
                                       Commonwealth Government of Australia offered a prize for the best layout and
                                       design for its new capital at Canberra, he was successful in a competition
                                       open to the world, and was invited to Australia to see his designs carried
                                       out. In addition to having many fine buildings to his credit he developed a
                                       residential suburb of Sydney - Castlecrag - so far in advance of current
                                       Australian ideas that it is only now beginning to be appreciated at its full
                                       value.

            <p><a name="d0e6881"></a>newspaper production so as to insure that the first essential, that of
                                       "fitness for function," should be achieved. But he had great respect for
                                       tradition and a great love of beauty and would never accept the theory that
                                       a house is merely "a machine to live in" or a factory merely a "machine to
                                       work in." When one has an opportunity to plan a building for a special
                                       purpose and that purpose is the manufacture of a news paper, there is a
                                       natural tendency to "go all modern" and to seek for a design which shall
                                       stand out as strikingly up-to-date. Mr. Griffin suppressed any such tendency
                                       on the part of his client with a firm hand. He would have been the first to
                                       approve such a building as the railway station in Helsinki, for Helsinki is
                                       a city only 20 years old. But he felt - and said bluntly - that
                                       ultra-modernism in Lucknow would be an error of taste, in fact, bad manners.
                                       As he wrote in the Pioneer, the faults of the present-day Indian
                                       architecture are:-
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6884"></a>1. A loss of feeling for design and a slovenliness in construction.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6887"></a>2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the
                                       cultured thinkers who are in the minority.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6890"></a>"These tendencies," he added "are quite understandable. But in the only
                                       remaining great country where religion, however people may differ about it,
                                       is the dominating force in human conduct, they must be vigorously combated
                                       ...... The Western world, having concentrated on making nature the servant
                                       of man, is tending in "modernistic" architecture toward constituting of
                                       frank utilitarianism the sole test of beauty. This is perhaps a praiseworthy
                                       reaction from the state of absence of all principles save size and
                                       ostentation. But for India, where religion is not forgotten and where
                                       industrialism has not yet engrossed other interests, materialistic modernism
                                       would be unnatural:.... The secret of artistic growth under modern
                                       conditions is that everything, however trivial, must be made more and more
                                       beautiful, for in that way only is progress possible."

                                       he held that "the general run of construction in the towns is evidently the
                                       worst that has ever afflicted them." Nor did it mean that he was prepared to
                                       accept the conventions of verandas, chaggas, unnecessarily high ceilings,
                                       etc., when he could adapt his building to the climate by more modern and
                                       more efficient devices.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6917"></a>On this subject he is worth quoting. "The three distinct and contrasting
                                       seasons of India present some apparently contradictory requirements, in the
                                       United Provinces particularly," he wrote, "but these difficulties are no
                                       greater than elsewhere where the temperature range is far greater. Perhaps
                                       too exclusive attention has been paid to the most disagreeable season, for
                                       as a result buildings are generally so dark and cheerless in the cold season
                                       that artificial lights, as well as heat, are imposed upon the occupants when
                                       the sun is shining brightly and warmly out of doors. Encircling verandas,
                                       deemed desirable for keeping the sun off the walls, do not effectively
                                       reduce the heat absorption of the building proportionately with the effort,
                                       and in the case of one-story buildings this absorption is mainly
                                       attributable to the roof. In characteristic internal rooms with clere-story
                                       windows the proportionate roof absorption can easily be seen to be as 16 to
                                       one, taking account of the incidence of the sun's rays in this low latitude
                                       and the greater insulating resistance of the customary wall construction.
                                       Verandas on the North should certainly be avoided for the sake of interior
                                       brightness and usefulness at all seasons. On the remaining sides, so far as
                                       the utility of the rooms is concerned, the device of hollow wall
                                       construction, costing nothing, reduces the heat penetration one third and
                                       the shadows of the trees are more effective than verandas in intercepting
                                       the horizontal rays of morning and afternoon."

                                       much like bake-ovens is the roof terrace, which accumulates the sun's rays
                                       for distribution during the night and succeeding days.

                                       the structural boon of hollow or cellular slabs at no cost..... The flat
                                       roof is of the greatest advantage in subordinating buildings to their
                                       natural surroundings and in harmonizing the relations in groups and masses.
                                       Wider spans, facilitated by reinforced concrete, not only make practicable

                                       loftiness. For when one considers how radiant heat is transmitted from the
                                       ceiling under a roof one can see that the effect of distance is almost
                                       negligible. What is of real importance is the insulation above the radiant
                                       ceiling, whether of confined or connecting air spaces, evaporation or

                                       beams 4" deep and 2" wide were adopted and the soundness of Mr. Griffin's
                                       theories, as well as his successful setting of the building, was shown by

                                       Pioneer wrote:- "as a man, Mr. Griffin was one of those few who are
                                       naturally described as "too good for this world." With great charm of manner
                                       and a fund of humor and good spirits, he was so entirely and so obviously
                                       selfless that there was something saintly about him. He could be obstinate -
                                       but only in defense of a job, to see that it was properly done. Where his
                                       own interests were concerned he was only too ready to give way rather than
                                       argue with those with whom he was not in sympathy. He could be intolerant
                                       but only of the cheap, the shoddy, the second-rate. He had strong opinions -
                                       but he was, as he himself said, always learning and kept a receptive mind.
                                       Finally, he was courtesy, kindness and patience itself and lived in great
                                       simplicity and happiness."

                                       the building - and particularly the roof - was something new in India or at
                                       least in Lucknow. Mrs. Griffin, herself a gifted architect with the same
                                       professional qualifications as her husband, continued his work on the
                                       drawings for some little time, for the details had naturally not been
                                       completed. But she had to return to Australia to settle his affairs and The
                                       Pioneer was again fortunate in securing the services of Mr. S.N. Irfanullah,
                                       who had already been associated with Mr. Griffin on the plans of the
                                       building. On him fell the full burden of supervising the construction and
                                       making all the necessary calculations and drawings while it was in progress.
                                       To him is due the credit for carrying out Mr. Griffin's design. But it must
                                       be shared with the contractors, Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram who tackled a big
                                       and far from easy job with great spirit and efficiency. The Indian mistri

                                       not readily persuaded to change his ways. But Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram,
                                       thanks to the personal interest and attention of the partners, saw that Mr.
                                       Griffin's methods were successfully adopted. Invaluable assistance in
                                       solving the problems of the roof was also given by Rai Sahib Hari Chand, the
