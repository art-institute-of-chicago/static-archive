            <p><a name="d0e1258"></a>But time is short. Looking at the destruction already wrought, at the
                                       materialism growing on every side, at the increasing bitterness and unrest
                                       throughout the world, at the tremendous power of our latest weapons, a
                                       realist might well conclude that many of us now living will see the start of
                                       a war which will end in more dark ages.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1261"></a>There is no materialistic solution, no political formula, which alone can
                                       save us. Man has never been able to find his salvation in the exact terms of
                                       politics, economics and logic. From Plato's Republic to Roosevelt's United
                                       Nations, his planned Utopias have not proved the answer, for the answer is
                                       at a deeper level.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1264"></a>Our salvation, and our only salvation, lies in controlling the Arm of Western
                                       Science by the Mind of Western philosophy guided by the eternal truths of
                                       God. It lies in the balanced qualities of spirit, mind and body of our
                                       people. Without this control, without this balance, our military victories
                                       can bring no lasting peace, our science no lasting progress.

            <p><a name="d0e1383"></a>In the capital city of the Commonwealth of Australia modern theories in city
                                       planning are applied on a scale heretofore unknown. At the time of the
                                       organization of the Commonwealth provision was made for the creation of a
                                       new Capital in preference to utilizing for that purpose either of the
                                       leading cities of the Commonwealth, and a Federal District corresponding to
                                       our District of Columbia was established in the Yass-Canberra region of New
                                       South Wales. The Plan of Walter Burley Griffin of Chicago provides for a
                                       city having an area of approximately twenty-five square miles. In its
                                       essential outlines the city is completely planned, while the arrangement of
                                       the federal and other public groups is developed in considerable detail.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1386"></a>The location is about midway between Sydney and Melbourne and seventy five
                                       miles from the east coast of Australia. The site is a valley having a
                                       general elevation of two thousand feet above sea level and is bordered by
                                       hills and mountains. Two prominent peaks, Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain,
                                       rise abruptly out of the northerly part of the valley. On the southerly edge
                                       is a low-lying mountain, Mugga-Mugga, and sheltering forested ranges
                                       culminating in the distance in the snow-capped peaks of the Murrumbidgee
                                       watershed.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1389"></a>Scattered over the valley are a number of lesser hills among which are
                                       Kurrajong, Camp Hill, Vernon, Russel and Shale. A stream known as the
                                       Molonglo River flows through the site from east to west. A determining
                                       factor in the plan of the city is the form of the valley which, as will be
                                       noted on the map, is irregular. It is evident that while presenting a number
                                       of serious problems this site furnishes a magnificent setting for a city of

                                       as follows:- Federal, municipal, educational, recreational, manufacturing,
                                       market, residential and agricultural.

            <p><a name="d0e1422"></a>The central portion of the city is designed with reference to two axes placed
                                       at right angles to each other. One, designated as the land axis, extends
                                       from the summit of Mount Ainslie through Camp Hill and Kurrajong, and has
                                       its distant terminus in the peak of Mount Bimberi thirty miles to the
                                       southwest, it being a fortunate coincidence that the line joining the
                                       summits of these two mountains passes through the two lesser hills. The
                                       secondary axis, designated as the water axis, extends from the summit of
                                       Black Mountain to a prominent point on the shore of the upper lake. These
                                       axes lie midway between cardinal and diagonal points of the compass. Since
                                       this is recognized as the most favorable orientation with reference to
                                       sunlight and shade in a warm climate, the federal and other public groups
                                       are located parallel to these axes.

            <p><a name="d0e1425"></a>The Molonglo River is utilized for the development of five lagoons, two of
                                       which have shore lines determined by the topography, and three of which are
                                       architectural in form. These lagoons are designed as the central feature in
                                       the architectural setting, and determine the location of the public groups.
                                       The fall of the river is slight, and a weir dam of moderate height is
                                       sufficient for impounding the water for the four lower lagoons. For forming
                                       the upper lake a dam with sluiceways for regulating the flood waters is
                                       provided. This dam will also serve for carrying the railway across the
                                       waterway.

                                       activities, the federal group is the one of dominating importance, and is
                                       therefore given the central position. A further consideration is that such
                                       activities are largely deliberative and require an accessible but quiet

            <p><a name="d0e1436"></a>the federal group is at Kurrajong Hill, on the land axis. From this center
                                       radiate one avenue to the north through the Municipal Center and continuing
                                       through the Manufacturing Center at the northern limits of the city, and
                                       another avenue to the northeast terminating in the Market Center. On the
                                       crest of Kurrajong is the administration building, flanked on the east by
                                       the premier's residence and on the west by the governor general's residence.
                                       In the triangle formed by the two radial avenues and the south shore of the
                                       central lagoon is the federal group.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1439"></a>The crest of Kurrajong is about one hundred and sixty feet above the general
                                       level of the valley. From this hill the ground slopes to Camp Hill, and
                                       thence to the lagoon. This feature of the topography has been utilized in a
                                       series of terraces on which the parliament and departmental buildings are
                                       located. As will be seen from the above tabulation this group is developed
                                       in sequence of function. Driveways wind in and out among the units of the
                                       federal group. Connection between driveways on different levels and between
                                       driveways and main radial avenues is made by means of ramps.

                                       obstructing the view along the land axis is the stadium. The museums,
                                       gymnasium and baths are located along the north shore of the lagoon between
                                       the radial avenues, the intermediate and adjoining spaces being used as
                                       public gardens. North of the gardens are the theatre and opera and several
                                       other buildings devoted to public and non-utilitarian uses. Continuing on
                                       the land axis north from the stadium is Ainslie Parkway, terminating in
                                       Ainslie Park on the lower slopes of the mountain. This entire group, to be

                                       principle is observed in correlating the theoretical and applied sciences.
                                       This principle is carried further in locating different sciences adjacent to
                                       facilities for illustrating their theory and application. In the application
                                       of this principle the school of law is located on the side nearest the
                                       Municipal Center. The school of agriculture is adjacent to the botanical
                                       gardens, which extend inland from the west shore of the lower lake, while

            <p><a name="d0e1485"></a>The modern tendency in city development is toward long alignments of trade
                                       along lines of communication. With the long avenues connecting the centers,
                                       as provided in this plan this tendency is encouraged. The plan is such,
                                       however, as to discourage the spread of trade into adjacent territory, since
                                       the intermediate streets, owing to discontinuity or change in direction, are
                                       ill adapted to use as thoroughfares and are therefore unattractive as
                                       locations for trade. In this way permanently quiet zones are provided that
                                       are suitable for residential purposes and, at the same time, are convenient
                                       to lines of trade and communication.

                                       parkways into three separate arteries of travel to provide for fast and slow
                                       vehicles and tramways. It is designed so to locate the tramways in the
                                       intermediate sections that at any point in the city will be within five
                                       blocks of a tramway. The Federal Center is the focus and transfer point of
                                       all tramways in the city. Tramways will be laid in the avenue encircling
                                       Kurrajong Hill, and connections will be provided to lines on each of the
                                       radial avenues.

                                       the buildings of the public groups if built according to his recommendations
                                       will consist of compositions in line and mass designed with reference to the
                                       purposes of the buildings and the requirements of the materials used, and
                                       independently of all historical styles. Reinforced concrete and marble are
                                       recommended by him as the materials best suited to the purpose. A study of
                                       the plans reveals remarkable success in utilizing prominent points for
                                       aspect and prospect. In this connection it is only necessary to call
                                       specific attention to Mount Ainslie and Kurrajong Hill, both visible from
                                       all parts of the city and both commanding the widest possible view of the

                                       south, 40 miles to the west, and seven miles northwest. Surrounded by grassy
                                       plains, the slopes of this virgin site are openly wooded, chiefly with
                                       blue-green, cypress-like callitris trees interspersed with small eucalyptus
                                       Mallee and Yarran. The main canal, which will flow through the lower portion
                                       of the city, will be of service for irrigation to only its smaller lower
                                       portion, but a high level channel, part of a projected pumping scheme, may
                                       serve for the bulk of the remainder of the city.

                                       passage-way connecting the market entrance with the post office these two
                                       permanent features of the civic architecture in the commercial zone are

                                       approach. Allotments for business are of a maximum depth of 160 feet and are
                                       provided with rear shipping ways 30 ft. wide. The typical frontage width is
                                       30 ft. in order to allow of the most economical spans to fix a serviceable
                                       minimum limit of shop. Extending radially from the markets and the station
                                       along the lines of the railway are the business districts to accommodate the

                                       where these most important structures of the city will command the
                                       commercial axis and dominate the vistas from every other direction.
                                       Moreover, all the other public buildings and most conspicuous edifices of
                                       the city are platted on the same system of parallels to contribute
                                       additional elements to this architectural domination, definitely linked in
                                       the simplest possible way.

                                       following notes may be an aid to the identification of the prominent

            <p><a name="d0e2418"></a>No difficulty will be experienced in tracing the line of the main canal from
                                       where it enters the urban area on the east and crosses the Wilbriggie
                                       railway just north of the hotel center (A). The effect which will be
                                       produced by its sweeping curve round the central portion of the city and by
                                       the two enlargements of the waterway is very apparent.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2421"></a>Due north of the hotel center, the railway station (B) can be readily
                                       distinguished, but the line of the railway from Barellan to Griffith is not
                                       at all prominent. Further north again, and a little to the east of the
                                       railway station, the block of academy buildings (C) makes another prominent
                                       feature of the landscape. Following the western curve of the railway from
                                       Wilbriggie, just after its junction with the Barellan line at the railway
                                       station, the post office buildings (D) and markets can be picked out, and
                                       still further to the left-hand side of the picture, right in the center of
                                       the town, is possibly the most prominent landmark of all - the
                                       administrative center (E). No doubt the years to come will see the Town Hall
                                       flag waving gaily on many festive occasions. The theatre (F) does not show
                                       out very distinctly, and the same is also true to a lesser extent of the
                                       hospital (G). There is nothing of outstanding prominence in the
                                       manufacturing and commercial area (H), and buildings of striking design have
                                       not been shown for the agricultural show grounds (I), but in a reproduction
                                       of such small dimensions it is impossible to illustrate adequately many of
                                       the important features of the plan.

                                       leading educational activities, a site of 16.48 acres is given the high
                                       terminal point of the commercial axis opposite the government, where at the
                                       outset, anyway, the public high school or academy group may be established
                                       to be supplemented by contiguous parallel private institutions for which
                                       flanking situations are reserved.

            <p><a name="d0e2441"></a>As the center combining recreation with educational motives, a site for a
                                       Public Institute to house library, art gallery, museum and lecture halls is
                                       indicated facing the Government group across the broad water and park from
                                       the north-west direction. This important edifice might well be allied with
                                       an agricultural college, whose experimentation plots occupying irrigated
                                       land, would have unobstructed scope for extension toward the west without
                                       necessity for intersection by or interruption with any internal traffic of
                                       the city.

                                       is the Exhibition Grounds, wherein race meetings may be held as well as the
                                       annual agricultural and horticultural show. Such a site, because of its
                                       merely occasional use, cannot be central, but in this case it is most
                                       readily accessible by means of main traffic and tram routes on either side.
                                       It occupies a hillock terminating another one of the radial avenues. This
                                       mound of just appreciable rise is enough to greatly enhance the effect of a
                                       show feature of the city, and the canal which abuts it for a distance of
                                       almost half a mile will contribute a special attraction.

                                       by no means gives a true conception of the permanent wild reserve that will
                                       be available to the residents for outing; the whole wooded rocky ridge
                                       extending for miles being contiguous with the Ridge Park that lies within
                                       the mile and a quarter radius. In fact, this range may be one of the

                                       canal, which flows around the administrative center in an arc. This channel,
                                       with curving embankments with expanded ponds and water gardens, is the
                                       enlivening natural element of the City Park for midday respite of the
                                       sedentary workers and for continual promenade. A resplendent garden holds
                                       inspiration for everyone, and an additional benefit if the attempt is made
                                       to widely vary the examples of plants or animal life and indicate their
                                       names and associations. Where handy like this one, it not only offers the
                                       social rallying place and commons for all but invites general use for
                                       concerts, festivals, and pageants, and affords youths opportunity for
                                       competitive games and water sports.

                                       avenues, together with their cross connecting annular streets in the
                                       business districts. Every opportunity that the undulations of the site
                                       afford has been utilized to provide the necessary separate grade over the
                                       railway thoroughfares, the natural slopes intersected by the latter being
                                       sufficient to accommodate not only roadways but their attendant building
                                       frontages, insuring a maximum of continuity and flexibility for commercial

                                       100 ft. which allows for central parking where needed for tramway cross
                                       connections or for distributing irrigation canals in addition to moderate
                                       roadways. Option with the authorities is reserved as to the treatment of
                                       individual streets, but the roads generally are intended to be occupied for
                                       public use only to the extent of widths proportionate to their lengths and
                                       positions in the city, thus conforming to the amount of traffic that may be
                                       expected or that may develop. With the lengths and breadths reduced where
                                       the least traffic is wanted, the additional depth thus made available for
                                       the more out of the way of the uniformly plotted blocks, registers that
                                       increasing proportion of private site to public ways which is natural.

                                       Mr. Griffin's time absorbed by Federal matters (out of the last ten months
                                       he has given less than two to his private work) he is not reaping much
                                       advantage from the partnership. We all feel that it is much better that it
                                       should not continue. It is not to be expected that a chance partner should
                                       have the burning devotion to Mr. Griffin's ideals that he and we uns have,
                                       nor a willingness to work on the very long lines which leave financial

            <p><a name="d0e2617"></a>As to the Federal Capital matters there are two possible solutions of the
                                       very trying and we sometimes fear impossible situation. One is that the
                                       Parliament and Ministers do not understand the motives of the Civil Service
                                       which is determined to control everything itself without the embarrassment
                                       of outside inspection of its methods or results, or that they feel helpless
                                       to contend against the absolute autocracy of a body established for life
                                       over which neither the people nor their political agents have any control
                                       whatever and into whose hands the nation pours all its taxes for them to
                                       spend entirely at their pleasure the result necessarily being that they care
                                       nothing for the efficiency of the works they undertake but only for the
                                       increasing of their own force and power. The other is that they are in
                                       cahoots with them for of course there are to be tremendous contracts let or
                                       expenditures made in the course of construction of the city. Both elements
                                       may enter into the situation.

                                       method it established, and because of the caliber of the work it would call
                                       forth. We still hope that the mistake of calling it off can be remedied
                                       although it will be very hard to reestablish the confidence of competitors,
                                       or in the judges for whom, standing at the head of their profession, it

                                       Minister <a name="43"></a> [Note: Andrew Fisher] up to the present has refused to allow

                                       whole, not comprehending the facts, are indifferent. Bit by bit Mr. Griffin
                                       has awakened various individuals to the facts, and there are several men who
                                       are doing what they can to help but it is mighty little they can do
                                       apparently. Dr. Maloney <a name="45"></a> [Note: William Robert Nuttall Maloney?] a

                                       for the cause. It is time there was a muckraking campaign in Australia but
                                       as yet Australians feel that it is their duty to conceal the defects of
                                       their system. It of course makes them easy prey.

                                       Mr. Griffin's correspondence with the Minister would lay them open to grave
                                       suspicions, that the execution of the Department Plan would make them the
                                       butt of the ridicule of the world, that their failure to fulfill the
                                       government's contract with Mr. Griffin, with the International jury of
                                       eminent architects, and with the competitors many of whom had done a lot of
                                       work before cancellation, will seriously impair the nation's credit, that
                                       the undertaking has such an appeal to the imagination that these things are
                                       going to be talked and written about for a very long time to come. However
                                       it is very difficult for them to get any comprehension of the general
                                       interest. If the Labor Party fails to recognize this we are going to have to
                                       depend on a gradual awakening of the Australian people which may take
                                       decades.

                                       I have taken to the type-writer. I know it will be a relief not to have to
                                       puzzle over my writing. Though I am far from being an expert with the
                                       machine it is very much easier than writing and, I think, faster even with
                                       the short practice that I have had. It was a delight to get the Round Robin

                                       There is a very strong anti-American feeling here for one aspect of which
                                       Theodore Roosevelt is responsible in his pompous sending around the world of
                                       the U.S. fleet with its flip assurance which of course he had no business to
                                       make, that if Australia ever needed assistance the U.S. fleet would be on
                                       hand to help. In fact the coming of the U.S. fleet was a large element in
                                       starting them here on the battleship building fever and military movements
                                       which are getting an appalling grip on the spirit of the people which, in
                                       connection with a firmly entrenched bureaucracy over which the people have
                                       absolutely no control, bids fair to strangle the development and prosperity
                                       of the country for the next decade or two. There is no chance here for any
                                       foreigner (and any new-comer is considered to be a foreigner) to prosper in
                                       any field, trade or profession (except dentistry) and that is not only our
                                       personal judgment but the universal opinion of those with whom we talk many
                                       of whom have lived here some years. But is not only the freezing out of
                                       strangers but a deliberate destruction of all the business of the country
                                       for Socialism is being established here by both parties whether radical or
                                       conservative and all its deadly consequences are in process.

            <p><a name="d0e2695"></a>It is a nation of pessimists full of fears; ideals are rarely to be found in
                                       the country. All their policies are based on fear. Protective tariff is
                                       doing its deadliest for as G.H. Perris (whose writings by the way you all
                                       ought to read) says though a large country can stand the consequences of a
                                       protective policy (the U.S. for instance being one of the biggest examples)
                                       it will quickly strangle a small country. It certainly is strangling them
                                       here where wages are very low compared to ours and the cost of living high.
                                       There is bitter class feeling, the political parties being purely a class

                                       has, a laborite is one who hasn't." In private business no one trusts anyone
                                       and we are finding they have good reason. You would be amazed if I should
                                       tell you who made the following remark to us - "If I were in America I would
                                       take more pains than I would here in making a contract, but when it was once
                                       made I should feel confident that it would be fulfilled. Here I should know
                                       that no attention would be paid to it."

            <p><a name="d0e2706"></a>My husband is having the fight of his life in the matter which brought us
                                       over here and this is the remark reported to me by a lawyer, "I can't make
                                       out what is the difficulty. It seems as if there must be something wrong."
                                       "There certainly is," was the answer; "the whole Civil Service is rotten in
                                       every Department." "Well but it seems to me that if Mr. Griffin had come
                                       over here and drawn his salary and not fussed he would have got along all
                                       right." "He certainly would," was the answer, "but he didn't come over here
                                       to draw his salary but to do the work he was appointed to do and to do it
                                       right," - and that's what we don't seem to be able to make any Australian
                                       understand.

            <p><a name="d0e2709"></a>And that is a fact. Though the fight isn't over yet, we are still hopeful
                                       that we have so far come in contact with the worst side and that soon the
                                       better element will begin to manifest itself and help to start things going
                                       right. There will have to be some signs of change soon or we shall feel
                                       called upon to start a publicity campaign making an open statement of the
                                       decidedly scandalous facts. The one word that describes the methods here is
                                       inefficiency and the one that describes the ideals is mediocrity.

            <p><a name="d0e2720"></a>useful a work as the one we were expecting to do. But one thing I must say.
                                       Don't ever let them fool you into thinking that, in comparison, Americans
                                       are a money loving people. The impression has arisen from the Americans'
                                       open expression of contempt of those of their compatriots who have been led
                                       by their desire of it, and from the many active measures that are being
                                       taken in America to make it impossible for the unfair accumulation of money.
                                       In European countries, and Australia is utterly European in its ideas, they
                                       have never yet dreamed of questioning the manner of getting money. They
                                       accept Special Privilege, which of course means unfairness, as a system
                                       divinely right, and give unquestioning adoration to those who hold the
                                       Privileges, envying of course but never questioning the propriety of the
                                       System, trying when they do anything at all only, by any means whatever, to
                                       get a privilege themselves.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2723"></a>There is not here a vestige of the feeling that it is a joy to work. No one
                                       has enthusiasm in what he is doing. The interest is merely in getting the
                                       money out of it. Of course we see that feeling in America, but here there is
                                       nothing else. At any rate the attitude is so all but universal that it is
                                       appalling, as is the feeling that one human being has a right to feel
                                       superior to another and that superiority gives him the right to do anything
                                       he wants to do to the inferior. The "ladies" are shocked if the servants
                                       refuse as they themselves do to eat the dark meat of the fowl, and are
                                       scandalized when they find the servant's family serves ham at home.
                                       Fortunately my job as a draftsman made it unnecessary for me to participate
                                       in society life.

            <p><a name="d0e2726"></a>The Australians find the Americans as inscrutable as the Chinese and I think
                                       for the same reason, that they do not believe that might is right, they do
                                       not believe in militarism nor imperialism. Two Australians, one a college
                                       professor, made a curious remark to me. It is typical of the general point

                                       something they themselves want, something neither has a right to have.
                                       Really the ideals of the two peoples are the same. There are individual
                                       exceptions of course. The remark was - "Here is someone who doesn't believe
                                       that the virility of a people is evidenced by its fighting tendency," -
                                       meaning me. I was hooted at as being ridiculously silly. I said - "Do you
                                       mean to say that you think that the Germans are proving their excellence and
                                       virility by the fighting at the present time?" "Certainly, they are showing
                                       what a splendid people they are." These were men who believed that Germany
                                       had started the war. Well we rarely hear anything but vituperation of the
                                       Germans at present but it is everywhere evident that the German ideal is the
                                       general ideal. This was but the unusually frank expression of the common
                                       ideal. In fact there is no such hatred of the Germans as there is of the
                                       Americans.

                                       work being on longer lines has not been seriously affected and we are very
                                       busy as always even if we are not getting rich fast. Of course one of the
                                       difficulties of our work is that we have to do so much of it ourselves, it
                                       is very difficult to find anyone to whom we can delegate it. We have an able

                                       here with us. Since the general conditions, which became apparent after we
                                       had been here a few months, have made the future so uncertain we gave up the
                                       idea of building a home until we could see more clearly, so our beautiful
                                       lot in Vaucluse <a name="48"></a> [Note: a suburb of Sydney] is still unoccupied. We four
                                       have been living in a cottage on another arm of the Harbor, right on the
                                       water's edge, with a beautiful bank dropping terrace after terrace for some
                                       80 feet, and at the bottom a swimming pool enclosed in concrete to keep the
                                       sharks from eating us up - quite a necessary precaution. The only complaint

            <p><a name="d0e2751"></a>1916 - May - Melbourne - Dear Gene <a name="49"></a> [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith, MMG's
                                       sister], I hope Mother doesn't think she has to write me long letters
                                       to make them worth while to me. Just a few sentences is enough to put me in
                                       touch with you all and give me a homey feeling. In fact your letters are all
                                       the home I have. Way back in Chicago Walter said to me he'd have to break me
                                       of the homing habit. He insisted that I had broken him of the home habit and
                                       that he'd have to do the same by me. Well I guess at last he has done it for
                                       except for the purpose of going to bed I have no desire to go anywhere. The
                                       office looks better than anything else to me. When Walter works at the
                                       private office I go to sleep on the couch, when he has to work at the
                                       Federal Office I stretch out on his desk and sleep there till he is ready to
                                       go which is usually half past eleven or twelve. Then we trail home looking
                                       like a couple of inebriates. Sometimes he sleeps on my shoulder, sometimes I
                                       sleep on his.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2757"></a>Sometimes he keeps on with his work on the train and after he is in bed till
                                       one or two o'clock. This is Sunday and I have been having afternoon tea with
                                       some of the ladies at the home of Mrs. Paling - a very pleasant home but I
                                       didn't want to go and two weeks from tonight I have another social
                                       appointment. I can't get out of them but have no way of returning the
                                       courtesy which adds to the trial. They always want him and he never can go
                                       so it makes it as unpleasant as it used to be to have to go instead of you
                                       where you were the one wanted. This having to play first fiddle roles when
                                       you are only built for second

            <p><a name="d0e2765"></a>fiddle parts is terribly trying. If I only had never married Walt but had
                                       just been his draftsman and had stuck to him in that capacity it would have
                                       been so much better. I would have been saved so many complications. The only
                                       difficulty would be that it might have added somewhat to his complications
                                       and heaven knows he has enough.

            <p><a name="d0e2768"></a>During the coming week in addition to all his legitimate work he has to write
                                       some volumes summarizing the evidence he had been giving the Works Committee
                                       for the past year and replying to the evidence of other witnesses called in
                                       on the questions of the Lakes of the Federal Capital and the Railroad and
                                       the roads, etc. and much of their evidence is deliberately misrepresented by
                                       a bunch of shysters who don't pay the slightest regard to truth in anything
                                       they say. Naturally it makes it very hard to reply to. Parliament meets on
                                       Wednesday and there are a dozen things he has to get ready for presentation
                                       to them. However we are hopeful that something may come of it.

            <p><a name="d0e2771"></a>The only thing I take any interest in doing is the work and I keep at it long
                                       after I have a curl in my back bone, and am sick with fatigue. I don't know
                                       what will become of me unless some of you folks come over to play with me.
                                       It's a queer kind of life Walter and I are living full of a kind of
                                       satisfaction but altogether too intense but with all its strenuousness there
                                       is a peace of soul which after all is all that is necessary. The currents we
                                       are pulling against have not yet proved too strong for us and we'll paddle
                                       on as long as we can. I have a notion we're helping to clear a way through
                                       the jungle but Lord how the beasts do snap and bite.

                                       of the whole street frontage of the Catholics' terraced property. The Chapel
                                       as shown will be in the center and the part already constructed will be
                                       duplicated on the other half of the property. A dome building - the ultimate
                                       library - will be on the street corner and the two dormitory wings with
                                       their terminal specialized buildings will complete the enclosing of the
                                       interior court.

            <p><a name="d0e2799"></a>The word "College" does not mean what it does in America. It means a
                                       dormitory building for students. This group however included in addition to
                                       dormitories and dining Hall not only a building for sports for the students,
                                       gymnasium, swimming pool, etc. but another building, architecturally
                                       identical, with laboratories, etc., for supplementing the university
                                       facilities.

            <p><a name="d0e2802"></a>These two buildings terminate the two stretches of student dormitories which
                                       extend at right angles to each other from the dining hall dome.

            <p><a name="d0e2805"></a>The whole of this is to be duplicated when its dome will become the Library.
                                       Then a chapel will be entered from between the two groups its forecourt
                                       flanked by the two scientific buildings, connected by a chapel cloister.

                                       the Catholic College of the Melbourne University. So that is one definite
                                       thing accomplished. The contract is &pound;51,000 and Walter feels that the
                                       contractor is a capable and energetic man so we hope things will go
                                       smoothly. All the conditions of the chief donor have been met so he will
                                       have a hard time to make trouble though he may. His chief objection was to
                                       having modern plumbing replace the time honored "thunder mug."

                                       Holman (wife of the New South Wales Prime Minister) said, and so apparently
                                       malicious that if they have any effect it is the opposite of their

                                       Thursday Walt went to his College Committee meeting at five and I snoozed on
                                       the couch till eight when he came back with the good news. We had all been
                                       on tenterhooks for several weeks, the Committee and all fearing war prices
                                       might make the costs prohibitive so when he came we danced a jig and said
                                       let's go to a picture show. Then ensued a discussion as to whether we should
                                       go to a show or be rational and get something to eat. We finally decided to
                                       be sensible for once and went to a China shop and had our favorite Ki Si
                                       Min. Finished at nine so we went to a movie too. Hit a fairly good one so we
                                       felt we had spreed it satisfactorily.

                                       so Genevieve is the lonesome one this week. Miss Benke stays nights when Roy
                                       is away so she is not really alone. We all wish Mother Griffin could have
                                       stayed two or three weeks longer even if Father did have to go home to his

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3598"></a>When it came to the Capitol Theatre in the heart of Melbourne, he was up
                                       against as difficult a situation as could face an architect, not only the
                                       bureaucracy but three different owners (one absentee, difficulty of dealing
                                       with an agent) none with a grain of aesthetic inclination. They all knew
                                       that to build a first class theatre they must maintain a certain standard
                                       but hated to spend a penny they could get out of. So there was another long
                                       fight - the Capitol as well as the Capital. In every case he had to put in a
                                       drawing of the ordinary thing and get a price on it. Then put in his own
                                       conception, beautiful, the price of which would be less than the ordinary
                                       thing so from their own standards they had to accept it.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3601"></a>There is still nothing comparable to it in the world. There has been much
                                       talk about interior illumination of theatres but here it is done on a grand
                                       scale, a stepped, oblong pyramidal ceiling, thousands of different colored
                                       lamps hidden by the beam steps and the light thrown up on intensely rich and
                                       deeply cut crystalline pattern, cuttings sometimes three feet deep so that,
                                       played as a color organ, it glows from alabaster white to rainbow colors in
                                       endless combinations and rich with shades and shadows, a mysterious
                                       loveliness and a powerful grandeur. As one architect expressed it, he could
                                       sit and watch that ceiling for a fortnight and when he came away he would
                                       not be able to draw it. The Paramount people at the opening said if it were
                                       built in New York it would be packed continually without their having to
                                       give any shows. By means of an electric switchboard this color organ is
                                       played for a half hour before each performance as well as in the
                                       intermissions.

                                       in another design with stepped piers running up above the roof, the center
                                       one the highest, and the others stepping down, all extending back giving a

                                       City Iowa, in that case not the piers but the keystones over the openings.
                                       His co-architect who according to the contract was to have no participation
                                       in design, construction nor superintendence, advised against this design.
                                       The first design was carried through. Later a building was constructed to
                                       this alternative design in Melbourne. For some years this markedly striking
                                       design appeared in many city buildings, <a name="56"></a> [Note: the words "Melbourne, Sydney"

                                       first tall building I saw under construction - in Madras - was this design.
                                       In this case it was charmingly and delicately handled. When I came back to
                                       the United States I found it in general use in bridges, etc. and in the most
                                       beautiful building of the New York Fair - the Russian Building. Truly a
                                       design once conceived persists in the etheric realm and becomes accessible
                                       to imaginative thinkers. We were always glad to see the senor's <a name="57"></a> [Note: Walter
                                           Burley Griffin's] work having so swift an influence on his time,
                                       only too slow for us. We could only wish that more builders took the trouble
                                       to train themselves to enter these realms in full consciousness and bring
                                       back treasures of beauty to be built into the world of manifestation. Anyway
                                       it was a joy to know that such creative work as constantly dropped from
                                       Griffin's pencil would have its influence in molding our civilization to
                                       beauty as our people trained themselves to loftier concepts than mere
                                       security; and as they learned the simple lesson of organizing their
                                       communities on lines that bring health instead of inevitable disease.

                                       so said:- A WONDERFUL BUILDING - In the midst of the celebrated Howie Estate
                                       in Swanston Street, a colossal structure of steel frame and concrete has
                                       lately been stripped of scaffolding and stands now revealed to thousands
                                       daily passing as a noble architectural feature set in the heart of the city.
                                       The New Building is to be known as "The Capitol." It will contain a
                                       remarkable picture theatre, surrounded by shops and surmounted by offices,
                                       housing, it is believed, the elite of the business enterprise of the
                                       metropolis.

            <p><a name="d0e3684"></a>The entrance hall visible from the street is broken by a low flight of
                                       semi-circular marble steps leading to a broad landing, and is ceiled with
                                       ornamented shallow gilt domes brilliantly lighted. Straight forward a broad
                                       arch leads to the floor of the house while, at the right of this, horse-shoe
                                       arches open on the stairways to the foyer and dress circle. An array of
                                       stout pillars in arabesque design supports a low roof heavily girdered in
                                       white coated concrete. The stairway walls are carved at the landings in
                                       consonance with the geometric design of the whole entrance hall. The motif
                                       of the design, deeply carved with arabesques, suggests something of
                                       mysteries beyond, which the moving picture men will no doubt endeavor to
                                       live up to. Upstairs the foyer surrounds a balustraded light area from the
                                       floor of which people will be able to look down upon the assembling crowds
                                       in the auditorium.

                                       commission with Griffin on this building. In the course of meeting the
                                       opposition of the Town Hall Griffin submitted alternative designs for the
                                       facade, stepped plinths rising above the roof with molding as shown here or
                                       stepped piers between the windows. Shortly after this his "silent" partner
                                       used the latter design in a building in Melbourne. The idea has swept around
                                       the world - in buildings, bridges, etc. It appeared nobly in the Russian
                                       Building in New York World's Fair and most charmingly in Madras, India.

                                       concrete and structural steel. Reinforced concrete is the material used by

                                       completely isolated in concrete. These descend on both sides of the theatre.
                                       (Comment by M.M.G. - These escape stairs accomplished the impossible task of
                                       two objects occupying the same space at the same time. Each was a double
                                       flight and in both cases neither of the two flights had any connection with
                                       the other. They were entered from various levels of the unusually deep
                                       balcony. The Municipal Council couldn't believe it was possible so a model
                                       was made to prove it. The supervisors of construction tried later to change
                                       certain flights here or there but found they couldn't change a single step.
                                       Though that was W.B.G.'s concept and requirement it was M.M.G.'s patience
                                       that worked it out as built.)

                                       standard not only for Australia but for deluxe cinema houses all over the
                                       world.

                                       Addison:- "It is not in mortals to command success but we'll do more,

                                       still vie with any theatre in the world today. It has defied the passage of
                                       years. It is as modern in its appointments, its comforts and its
                                       architecture as though it was at its First Anniversary instead of its Tenth.
                                       Truly it is still the showplace of Melbourne, the world's most unusual

                                       were enlisted to produce a perfect palace for the motion pictures. Columns,
                                       arches and arabesques of surpassing beauty gather the vision of all

                                       adrift from all the five orders. It was boldly declared that the
                                       conventional forms of pillar, arch, architrave and pediment, with all their
                                       developed beauty, sprang from the Stone Age; and that modern material, steel
                                       and concrete, had no dependence on these time honored bases of stability.
                                       Concrete in its plastic state can be molded to any fancy; in its final
                                       setting, reinforced with steel, it is stronger than granite.

                                       tapered on the classical sculptured models but are modeled in cement with
                                       quaint diapered designs that compel admiration by their originality. Even
                                       the cornices have been left without the conventional moldings, and are

                                       captured by the unique design of the walls and ceiling. Since there is a
                                       complete absence of pillars the designer applied his imagination to the
                                       novel decorations on the walls and ceiling, and not a square inch has been
                                       allowed to escape. The side walls are buttressed by arrays of square-cut
                                       supports, and above these the walls break into the ceiling in cubes,
                                       triangles and stalactites of fretted plaster. Everywhere the straight line
                                       prevails. The curves and moldings of conventional design are entirely
                                       absent. The ceiling itself, over the central stalls, breaks up into a great
                                       height in serrated lines of fretted plaster, all broken into little cubicles

                                       or conceived by any other architect in the world. The architect, Mr. Walter

                                       architectural feature is the array of beautiful alabaster prisms constructed
                                       about the ceiling and side walls of the auditorium. The structure of these
                                       features was an art in itself. Each block of prisms had to be exactly molded

                                       miracle of the formation of crystals except that here a particularly
                                       appropriate form has been decided on and fixed in concrete form. That a man
                                       could conceive such an idea, so aloof from the orthodox and standard
                                       architectural canons, is a matter of utter astonishment and admiration.
                                       There is a suggestion in the architecture of liquefied stone having been
                                       thrown up in successive rectangular jets and congealed when and where the
                                       architect's vivid imagination decreed geometric formation. Yet so consistent
                                       and deliberate is the whole scheme that one comes to the conclusion that its
                                       madness has a lot of calculation in it. These solid forms are not shaped as
                                       prisms or faceted for fun, but more like gems by a giant lapidary. Something
                                       serious is behind it all. This becomes evident when the lights are turned

                                       There is no other architecture or lighting scheme like it in the world. It
                                       is the work of a genius in resource and an artist in effects. In the past

                                       every patron of the theatre. Today this wizardry of lighting and elaborate
                                       decoration is as modern and unique as any of the present day architecture.

                                       curious and heavily gilded ticket boxes attract attention immediately. Most
                                       original in design and construction they are decorated entirely in cubes and
                                       squares of bronze, plaster and metal, these decorations forming frames for
                                       the large sheets of grained glass which serve as walls to the boxes. Behind
                                       the glass, gold leaf is heavily applied. The huge glass chandelier hanging
                                       from the roof above the main box-office adds to the brilliance and
                                       decorative scheme of the front lobby.

                                       of orange and apricot with curious arrowheads of black and green, designed
                                       by Griffin and woven in London. The landing is ceilinged with ornamented

                                       actually the colorings harmonize remarkably and offset well the Aztec like

                                       area. A cool theatre and a restful one were primary aims in the interior
                                       decoration. Indeed color effects throughout were watched very closely and
                                       skillfully. Almost as impressive as the ceiling are the giant sandstone
                                       pillars in the foyer. Light sienna in tone, they are multisided with the
                                       tops and bases relieved by broad dual shoulders painted in brown and bronze.
                                       Let into the faces of these pillars are risen squares of plaster, the spaces

                                       ceiling are carried down in the proscenium arch whose main form is
                                       determined by the forms of the units. These surfaces in the ceiling are
                                       built up of crystalline forms cut from depths of a few inches to a depth of
                                       three feet giving endless reflections from surface to surface quite
                                       indescribably lovely. These forms of the ceiling steps are carried down in
                                       the Proscenium where enough of their more hidden surfaces are open for sound
                                       transmission. The organ pipes are concealed on both sides and the sound
                                       pours out from the center. The proscenium is illuminated as is the ceiling
                                       from concealed lamps so that any color can be played as a whole or in any
                                       part in any combination. Since the whole of the material world is made up
                                       from the battle between light and sound - the form-building forces - these
                                       two can touch all the strings of human nature for the temperaments too -
                                       choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic and melancholic are determined by a
                                       preponderance of one or another of these forces, red, yellow, blue, lilac -
                                       creating warmth, light, sound &amp; magnetism.

            <p><a name="d0e3963"></a>In Australia, 25 years ago, in 1914, one might say one saw Europe in the
                                       final stages resulting from the disease of bureaucracy. This is evidenced in
                                       the hopeless ugliness of everything done by man, in the antipathy to and
                                       fear of beauty.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3966"></a>The first step in the construction of Canberra was taken, before the plan of
                                       the city had been made, in establishing the Military Quarters - Duntroon.
                                       The designer had to accept its location as one of the external facts to be
                                       faced. Empty spaces for hundreds of miles around but every pains taken to
                                       make it a slum - narrow streets (very narrow as in Europe) with shanty
                                       houses jammed together. Always in these ways the Civil Servants keep up the
                                       pretense of economizing in the expenditure of tax money and always the costs
                                       are enormously greater than they need be, and always it establishes
                                       conditions which tend to maintain classes.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3969"></a>This urge to maintain classes is still evidenced in Canberra (1940) by the
                                       requirement that officials build their homes in particular suburbs according
                                       to their salaries. This is not a law but if, as occasionally happens, a man
                                       builds in a suburb for lower salaried officials his chances for promotion
                                       become small indeed. In the early years the majority of citizens are certain
                                       to be Civil or Military officials.

            <p><a name="d0e3972"></a>They put through the construction of the Cotter dam some 40 feet high
                                       supposed to be necessary for the city water supply but as the Royal
                                       Commission made clear later, a 10 foot dam of the upper Molonglo River was
                                       all that was necessary and would at the same time have maintained the series
                                       of lakes within the city in those river bottoms which cannot be used for
                                       anything else for each year they are flooded by the rains. For years the
                                       officials built the Canberra Railroad on these nice flats and, each year
                                       after the floods, built them over again. One hopes this dam will not follow
                                       the example of the great Murrimbidge <a name="61"></a> [Note: Murrumbidgee?] dam of the
                                       irrigation district, also built by the Civil Service

                                       water level has had to be lowered a third of the height. No one knows where
                                       it will go next. A pleasant prospect for those below. A Scandinavian
                                       engineer has been consulted who says the method of construction is faulty
                                       but when I saw it a short time ago the water was still dammed up. Well the
                                       irrigation districts are dependent on it so one can but live in hope they
                                       won't all be drowned. Anyway the building of another is all to the good from
                                       the Civil Service point of view.

            <p><a name="d0e3986"></a>We must remember that bureaucratic works cannot be judged by newly
                                       established experiments such as are being tried in the U.S. in the taking
                                       over by the government of public utilities, for example, for the men trained
                                       in private enterprise are taken over, men accustomed to efficiency without
                                       which private undertakings cannot continue to exist. The problem of these
                                       great enterprises can be properly solved only when our communities add a
                                       national Economic Organization to their Political one to be extended to a
                                       World Organization if we want peace in the world. As for the Civil Service,
                                       inefficiency is de rigueur, for inefficiency can always be made up out of
                                       taxation where it is usually not obvious because of lack of competition and
                                       where all advantage derives from inefficiency for through it the personnel
                                       is increased, the department strengthened and renown achieved through the
                                       fact of having spent great sums.

            <p><a name="d0e3989"></a>In Canberra it meant nothing to the officials that the bridge they built
                                       across the Molonglo was washed away the next season. They built another.
                                       They finally got into trouble about it only because the Canberra plan had
                                       been gazetted which meant no change could be made in it without an act of
                                       Parliament, and the dragon-eyed Mr. Smith <a name="62"></a> [Note: James Alexander
                                       Smith?] got questions asked in Parliament as to who had been
                                       authorized to change the levels established by the designer.

                                       transportation. As you travel over the mountains going from Sydney to
                                       Melbourne you look down below to the old wagon road making the crossing at a
                                       much better grade. Quite deliberately Governments choose the wrong way
                                       first. People gradually realize that another way is better so it becomes
                                       easy to scrap the old and build another, thus maintaining their force, still
                                       not choosing the right way if it can be avoided as in the case of the
                                       Railway to Canberra where in connection with the Arsenal City he was
                                       designing in the Federal District Griffin connected it with Sydney with a
                                       comfortable gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old one
                                       thus keeping the way open for another tear down and rebuild.

            <p><a name="d0e4003"></a>Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the Railroads in the
                                       control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America
                                       shows the consequences, for individual initiative has brought continental
                                       development in the United States. The Railroads have been undertaken and
                                       pushed far and wide, ahead of and encouraging settlement and development.
                                       The governmental control in Australia has made that impossible from the
                                       beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escape from a system
                                       firmly established where the preponderating vote of the population of the
                                       present cities now makes it always to the advantage of the politician to
                                       cater to the apparent urban interests and votes, and not "waste" their money
                                       on wild Railroads built out into empty spaces.

                                       simply connecting links between the established sea-coast cities leaving the
                                       interior of the continent empty (not because it is a desert which it isn't)

            <p><a name="d0e4028"></a>liaison between politics and economics through the establishment of a
                                       Threefold Commonwealth. This is the more difficult perhaps because in
                                       Australia the Labor Party is by no means a Labor Party but an industrial
                                       Organization whose interests are with the manufacturing elements as versus
                                       the primary producers. From another angle, Mr. Valentine, an official in the
                                       railway department but one of those whose mentality had not been perverted
                                       through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally owned and
                                       privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a definite time
                                       requires 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the government owned
                                       railroad it takes two hundred and forty seven. Our own experiences would
                                       lead us to take this as a typical example in the expense to a community of
                                       the Bureaucratic method. This does not mean that such undertakings should be
                                       handed over to individuals indiscriminately nor as monopolies but calls for
                                       a Political Organ that strictly maintains Equity and not Privilege.

                                       Griffin on their personal experiences told the following tale:- As sometimes
                                       happens, though rarely, he had been called in from outside to take charge of
                                       the undergrounding of the electric wires of the district of Sydney. As the
                                       work approached completion he called the attention of his superior officer
                                       to the necessity of placing the men in some other work as it was de rigueur
                                       not to dismiss civil servants. The chief not wanting to bother told him to
                                       find something for them to do. He replied that he couldn't and got the
                                       answer - "Well then tear out the work and do it over again." We have been
                                       informed that Chicago's drainage canal was dug in the daytime and filled at
                                       night, but however that may be bureaucracy in the economic realm is sure to
                                       end that way.

                                       wanting to lend money and never wanting the principle to be returned. In the
                                       tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable miserable things

            <p><a name="d0e4045"></a>streets by increasing the taxation. In Sydney the case was worse yet for with
                                       the often very steep slopes the grinding noise of the cable-drawn trams is
                                       unendurable and the old board seats intolerable. The buses on the whole
                                       simply supplemented the trams in districts where the trams were often miles
                                       away. For why should a bureaucracy bother to meet the needs of a community?
                                       Much better hold back as much of the income as possible for munition makers
                                       and other pals who will help pull off a war any time England wants one as it
                                       does every time an economic rival appears on the scene.

            <p><a name="d0e4048"></a>The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to the curbs for
                                       passengers). When the tramways began the fight against them they offered to
                                       buy the tramways and pay off the whole indebtedness in fifteen years, but
                                       no, the government bit by bit increased the tax till they could no longer
                                       meet expenses and had to quit. The years roll on with no decrease in the
                                       heavy rates. With increasing demands for buses they put on a few but first
                                       seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old trams with new
                                       heavily built ones, still uncomfortable, noisy and dangerous but enabling
                                       them to spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable up and
                                       down hill transportation for Sydney - the buses.

            <p><a name="d0e4051"></a>Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and
                                       urgently required service helps to maintain the "morale," helps keep the
                                       people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in
                                       the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in
                                       Australia, but it keeps people busy and feeling important. I thought a
                                       pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the
                                       women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part of
                                       their efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in
                                       something they had at heart which seemed a shocking thing to me who had been
                                       accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for

                                       things America is beginning to try all the things that have been done in

            <p><a name="d0e4065"></a>I listened to a lecture by Dr. Mary Booth urging the deputizing of the
                                       government to get financial aid for a health clinic for mothers separate
                                       from the clinic where sick children were brought. I went up to her afterward
                                       saying it would seem impossible for the government to supply money and then
                                       hand over the control of it to outsiders which was what they wanted, and
                                       asked why they didn't collect the money and carry out this work privately
                                       citing the work of that nature, hospitals, etc., in America that were
                                       supported by private contributions. Her answer was that America was richer
                                       than Australia. But, I said, Sydney is just as rich as New Orleans;
                                       Melbourne is as rich as many cities in America. They did this. But no! It
                                       wasn't to be considered for a moment. This is but one of the many ways of
                                       pauperizing Australia. I spoke of it so in a letter to my brother that first
                                       year in Australia and was called up by the police about it and had it not
                                       been that the U.S. was not yet in the war, I should in all likelihood have
                                       been put in jail for it as they quoted their authority for such a step which
                                       would have been applied if America had been allied with the world powers.

                                       it care what people think or know or say. England is an example. The oldest
                                       sons of the aristocracy form the House of Lords, the younger sons fill the
                                       offices of the bureaucracy which has complete control of the House of

                                       for the whole of this bridge depends on the strength of four pins only some
                                       ten inches in diameter necessary to take up movement. As it is, it is most
                                       unsightly and destroys the beauty of Sydney's Harbor by its scale as well as
                                       its intrinsic ugliness. But really there should have been a tunnel instead.
                                       Everything was right for a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic.
                                       From a military point of view it should have been a tunnel. And shortly they
                                       will have to build a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic. But then
                                       the government, on principle, does the wrong way first. From the British
                                       Empire they receive their titles for this. Just so much more money to be
                                       lent as well as fat jobs for Britishers. The first bombers of an enemy would
                                       strike this tempting target and that would block up the whole channel above
                                       which lies Cockatoo Island, the naval and armament works. Many of the
                                       structures built are too high to go under the bridge. Of course that's just
                                       what the government wants so now they are destroying another of Sydney's
                                       beautiful promontories gradually moving the whole of the Cockatoo Island
                                       factories, etc., over to Clifton Gardens. Of course they were a fine target
                                       for the Japanese there if Americans had not interfered with their southern
                                       course.

                                       of the bureaucracy is basic and not increased by any personal
                                       considerations. But Sir Elliot's (notice, he already had a title) position
                                       as head of the Town Planning Association lent support to the idea that town
                                       planning capacity was being used in the Federal City whereas it was nothing
                                       but imperial obstruction.

            <p><a name="d0e4109"></a>He was put in charge of starting the business center and - ca va sans dire -
                                       placed it in the center of a residential section. It has caused confusion
                                       ever since. Nobody can find his way around. One day Griffin asked him why he
                                       did that. Of course there was no reply. But since private ownership does not
                                       exist in the capital and the minting of money costs the government nothing,
                                       that mistake will be remedied in time which was not possible in Washington.

            <p><a name="d0e4142"></a>Allen Ravines comprise a most charming area of wooded glen and meadowed glade
                                       luckily left undisturbed by the agricultural interests which have long
                                       preempted the surrounding country. Its development is for the private use of
                                       its owners as a suburban place of residence accessible by motor, and wherein
                                       their common interests are met in the joint club house group and farm, and
                                       their individual interests in the private cabins of the several brothers.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4145"></a>The scheme as a whole is based on a conception of the tract as a wilderness
                                       to be maintained intact, so far as consistent with use, in its natural
                                       state. The general tendency in preserving the few exceptionally beautiful
                                       spots that are left to preserve in the midst of our civilization will be to
                                       convert them into parks more or less public, and injured because of that
                                       fact and of the consequent cleaning for use and thoroughfares, etc., etc.
                                       Here where we are not forced by such considerations is the opportunity to
                                       maintain a true relic of primeval Illinois.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4148"></a>This conception then determined, against the alternative of entering below
                                       the grounds say over the levy from the road on the east, and for acquiring
                                       land and entering at the northwest for a grandiose effect and for the
                                       advantage of providing for traffic as far as possible away from the most
                                       beautiful parts so that these are reached only last, by inconspicuous trails
                                       and foot paths.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4151"></a>The entrance from the west side highway is located where one, on entering,
                                       obtains a fine view of Decatur across the basin-like part of pasture most
                                       suitable to field sports for the outings of the owners' factory employees
                                       and at a level low enough to make the travel around the hill pasture and
                                       through the woods gradual ascent without special grading to the vehicle
                                       terminal, nowhere with a general view of the entire site and its boundaries,
                                       always with the objective undiscovered beforehand, and the limits left to
                                       the imagination.

                                       distance from the entrance yet sheltered from the highway by the round of
                                       the hill. The "House" on a commanding peninsula overlooks the first ravine
                                       with a vista of the Sangamon beyond and conversely shuts off the only
                                       objectionable view now obtaining on the premises, that of the farm-house on
                                       the highway as seen from the peninsula to the east of this one.

            <p><a name="d0e4162"></a>The Club Group is thus in a central position contiguous to the Game Fields as
                                       well as to the woods and ravines, to the custodian for easy supervision and
                                       to the features of wilderness, especially the spring-fed pool and private
                                       green, and accessible directly by foot paths as well as indirectly by
                                       "trails."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4165"></a>The cabins are located at such strategic points as indicated by their
                                       different names, "Valley Views," "Meadow View," "River View" and "Glen
                                       Point." They are reached from the Club by trails following lines where they
                                       will least interfere with the wildest features of the landscape thus keeping
                                       that rich rarity - a gem of Illinois forest as far as possible in its
                                       primitive state. Only the slightest touch in the depths of the valley is
                                       needed to make the springs available for a useful swimming pool.

            <p><a name="d0e4168"></a>The trails themselves as they leave the Club House are confined to such
                                       treatment of the ground as will prevent rutting but will not indicate the
                                       artificiality. The private domiciles in rough, saw-finished wood
                                       construction are to become almost as natural as birds' nests or, where of
                                       masonry, are to be terraced into the hillsides as unobtrusive as homes of
                                       Cliff dwellers.

                                       to whom the word enemy had been heretofore unknown. In a way it was again
                                       the Revolutionary War between America and Britain for our coming to
                                       Australia was another throwing of the tea into the Boston Harbor.

            <p><a name="d0e4202"></a>My own battle in Sydney is reflected in some of the correspondence of that
                                       year. A number of fine and very capable women lined up with me in the
                                       democratizing of Sydney's Town Planning Association. The following scraps of
                                       correspondence will hint at what was going on. It came to a head in the Town
                                       Planning Association in which a group of very capable women, including Mrs.
                                           <a name="68"></a> [Note: William Arthur] Holman, the wife of the Prime Minister
                                           <a name="69"></a> [Note: Premier] of New South Wales, who backed me through thick and
                                       thin in the battle for a new and democratic constitution for the society.
                                       The three chief enemies later spent much time vilifying Griffin going even
                                       to the Prime Minister, Mr. <a name="70"></a> [Note: William Morris] Hughes, who showed
                                       Griffin the matter they had put before him. The women won. These scraps of
                                       correspondence hint what was going on.

                                       Tuesday morning on the drawing of Mossmain, Montana with me so I got through
                                       comfortably by four o'clock. Can't get a litho-print on tracing cloth
                                       because the gelatin plate is moist. Can't get a litho at all satisfactory

                                       Genevieve is going to try to go down with me. Have written to Mrs. Franklin

            <p><a name="d0e4233"></a>I think in laying out the general perspective of Mossmain, Montana I'll stand
                                       near the business center to bring that into big scale and look across to the
                                       bluff and social center in the distance. The difficulty with this is that it
                                       doesn't show the Yellowstone River. How about it? It might be better to make
                                       my foreground the axis between the two centers. That would show the bluff
                                       well but the distance would not be so interesting.

                                       of pale at the best. By the time I had lettered it the buildings were
                                       invisible so I blacked them in. Then it seemed a pity to put so much work on
                                       and run the risk of not being able to get a reproduction after all so I
                                       started in inking in the streets and ended by inking the whole thing
                                       practically except the lines of the curb on the streets. Worked from seven
                                       after supper straight through till three o'clock in the morning. Up again
                                       and at it at eight and am now rushing down town to get it in the mail before

                                       my regrets, etc. I have just seen Grant who arrived in Melbourne at 2 this
                                       afternoon and is also leaving tomorrow. I feel that all has been right with

            <p><a name="d0e4259"></a>Dearest Walter, I'm terribly lonesome tonight. Mr. and Miss Sulman have been
                                       here. I'm afraid my surmise was true and that none of these men have any
                                       desire to have what they are doing under the scrutiny of a bunch of
                                       disinterested members. You can't get an Australian to be direct. Mr. Sulman
                                       settled himself close to me, and Miss Sulman went over and engaged Roy and
                                       Genevieve in animated conversation on the other side of the room. This was
                                       after we had been out in the yard and had discussed the beauty of the
                                       location in general. I asked him if he wanted to talk over Town Planning
                                       matters. He said he wanted to ask how matters were getting along in
                                       Melbourne. So we talked around the bush for a while and then, casually of
                                       course making it seem as if it were not premeditated, he dropped into the
                                       question. I can't give you the conversation but he insisted that the Women
                                       could not be organized as a Branch. (They must this week have organized a
                                       Randwick Branch.) He said the women could not take up general work but must
                                       do what the Council told them to do. I said if that were the case the women
                                       should be told what they were expected to do. He said they had thought they
                                       could take up such subjects as would be delicate for the men to handle.
                                       "That's why "we" have been giving such prominence to lowering street car
                                       steps so that pregnant women might not sustain injury, and to the height of
                                       laundry tubs." He said

            <p><a name="d0e4270"></a>he had made out a minute to be given to us stating that our work was to be
                                       the investigation of reserves and asked if that had been given to us. I told
                                       him it had not. Finally he said why would it not be well to have just a
                                       general conference. I said that was just what we were asking for. Well but
                                       not to consider any special motion but just to talk things over to come to
                                       an understanding. - - That's what we have asked for. There is no special
                                       motion. - - But I was told we were to consider a motion of yours. - - No I
                                       had no motion. - - Then the announcement we sent out isn't exactly correct.
                                       - - No, Mr. Sulman that is one of our difficulties. We are not being
                                       reported correctly. - - Are you sure there is no motion? - - Yes, the only
                                       motions made were that we should hold two meetings for consultation on the
                                       suggestions that were presented at the last meeting and any others that
                                       might be made, one to be at the next regular meeting and one special next
                                       week when we hoped the Council would meet with us.

            <p><a name="d0e4273"></a>And so the matter stands. The next meeting will certainly be a very difficult
                                       one. Of course Mr. Sulman will be in the chair. He is very suave and I don't
                                       know just how positive the women will be in the stand they take. To
                                       accomplish anything it may be necessary for the women to get busy and
                                       reorganize the main Association. Any 20 members can require the calling of a
                                       Special Meeting to consider amending the Constitution.

                                       the dumps since the conference yesterday, it all seemed so hopeless. There
                                       did come out very plainly however the actual facts of the situation and I
                                       put my side of it straight if not effectively. The enemy went the limit
                                       also, even beyond I should say, but whatever were the chief's opinions in
                                       the end he did not give me the least mite of encouragement and in fact did
                                       convey the converse throughout.

                                       stenographer was bunked in the same compartment with me. When we went into
                                       the Albany Station for breakfast we saw his Ex. incog. <a name="78"></a> [Note: Excellency

                                       Seymour stations. The Col. (Owen) <a name="79"></a> [Note: Percy Thomas Owen] (one of our

                                       compartment with us during the confab. It was all very pleasant and I had a
                                       chance to go into things somewhat and at the close His Excellency asked my
                                       address and hoped for another meeting and said au revoir, all somewhat
                                       encouraging.

                                       over but am making an alternative showing the large 2 story hall in its
                                       place without much modification other than a slightly more compact scheme.
                                       It seems probable that this will be the one really to advise because with
                                       the two stories close around three sides of the court as is necessary to get
                                       in all the upstair space, there will be little chance for the sun to get
                                       near the bottom and the real charm will be lost don't you think?

                                       good enough to point out that the American's desire for money was really his

            <p><a name="d0e4354"></a>Melbourne, 1915 May 5. - Marion dearest, I am not forgetting to pray for your
                                       good condition Thursday but there is no need to have solicitude on any other
                                       grounds. I shall even forgive you if I get no letters during your rush. Here
                                       everything is evidently just in the balance yet, I know absolutely nothing
                                       new. I did have a long talk with the editor of one of the papers yesterday
                                       afternoon, which was satisfactory but I am fully aware of the dominating
                                       policy of the Melbourne Press which is anti-Canberra of course first and
                                       last.

                                       may become evident. Otherwise the Senate motion comes up tomorrow and then
                                       more problems as to what to say and not say. I am wondering whether it will
                                       be possible for me to leave tomorrow night. I cannot tell until I have seen
                                       Senator Grant at least and he evidently will not arrive from Sydney until

                                       Circular Quay last night in time for the 8:15 ferry and found Genevieve and
                                       Roy on it. They had been to Manly. Are planning to go next Sunday to see our
                                       lot in Vaucluse and to call on Dawsons. Had quite a letter this morning from
                                       Mrs. Cooper. Says they have five signatures to our petition for a special
                                       meeting. Says Taylor and Hyman want a little quiet conference with her.
                                       Wonders if they think her green as cabbage.

                                       printing tomorrow. Do hope you got a berth last night and that Mr. Smith
                                       won't dissuade you from a positive statement concerning where to locate the
                                       factory plant. The lawyer told Roy he'd better see <a name="81"></a> [Note: J. Burcham]
                                       Clamp alone, that if a solicitor went along Clamp wouldn't say a word. Such
                                       nonsense. As if he's say a word to Roy if he went alone. Roy went to see him
                                       and is going to try to make him go along.

                                       celebrate the occasion (with tears and hisses and groans). We had our Town

                                       see how he is going to pull her out of this hole. I was very glad I had sent
                                       in notice of my motion for organization for the Agenda paper for it led them
                                       instead of sliding over things to come out and make a complete statement of
                                       the correspondence since the last meeting so we did not have to do that. As
                                       I told you, the women there are very far from being stupid and a number that
                                       I have never met or talked to rose to the occasion. A Mrs. Thomas got up
                                       immediately and inquired why the men should not take action on the motions
                                       we made. Mrs. Taylor told her the motion was entirely out of order, so
                                       unexpected, etc. She asked what there was out of order. "It was not on the
                                       Agenda paper." To which I told Mrs. Thomas that so far as I knew the Agenda
                                       paper was entirely unofficial and therefore informal and that any motion
                                       from any member was quite in order. I hoped the matter would be followed up.
                                       Then I passed around my scheme of organization.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4399"></a>Mrs. Taylor tried to stop me after I had read a sentence or two but of course
                                       I paid no attention to her, read through and explained as I went. Then made
                                       my motion that the next meeting should be a purely business meeting for the
                                       organization of the Section. Then we were lively for some fifteen minutes.
                                       Mrs. Thomas got up promptly with the remark that there was much of value in
                                       the suggestions and that as it was an important matter and that as only

                                       understanding that it would be taken up at the next meeting. This as an
                                       amendment to my motion was passed. Her promptness saved the day for then our
                                       secretary Mrs. Taylor got up and delivered a tirade. "It was a pity that the
                                       valuable time of the meeting should be taken up by such silly stuff. It was
                                       entirely out of order." (It was in the order of the Agenda paper.) "Such an
                                       outrage to thrust a great long mess of stuff on them so unexpectedly, etc."
                                       Then Miss Geach bobbed up. She certainly is all right and has a good head,
                                       ready to adjust herself to emergencies. She moved that we meet in two weeks
                                       for a preliminary discussion. The Taylor cohorts had had a lively whispered
                                       consultation during my reading. One now moved that the whole matter be
                                       dropped. Mrs. Thomas reminded them that her motion had been passed. Miss
                                       Geach reminded them that her motion was before the meeting and had been
                                       seconded. They then suggested that the men's Council should be asked to meet
                                       with us at that time. This was a substitute for the motion we had planned to
                                       have Miss Geach make and was entirely satisfactory, so it was passed. I
                                       enclose the agenda paper of the Men's council with notice of report of
                                       Women's Committee today. It came in the mail this morning. It is almost a
                                       pity you can't be there to witness this spicy report.

            <p><a name="d0e4413"></a>I shall be deeply interested in the stand the man take at our joint meeting.
                                       Of course it is altogether probable that the men from motives of self
                                       interest would much prefer not to be under the inspection and interference
                                       of a bunch of disinterested women. I think however from what I have seen
                                       they will not find the women entirely easy to manage. One of the ladies, a
                                       stranger to me, came up to me after our meeting and said "they" would find
                                       that a lot of brains had come into this club since the first meeting two
                                       months age. I said I hoped she would be at the joint meeting and she said

            <p><a name="d0e4421"></a>would. A number of others spoke to me in similar vein. One of the cohort, a
                                       Mrs. Clark, had said that stuff of mine was pure theory. She didn't see why
                                       they should bother with it. They showed themselves so purely spiteful and
                                       personal that I think it had a very marked effect on the members as a whole.

                                       by getting up there and talking all that dribble about lofty motives and
                                       Australia this and that. What do they think we are anyway." Also that after
                                       we were seated she said, "Lets go into the other room where perhaps we can
                                       get a bit of carpet under our feet" - so she too suffers from cold feet -
                                       that kind. Hope her chilblains aren't as bad as mine.

            <p><a name="d0e4433"></a>This afternoon I went to see Mrs. R.D. Hall at her husband's office, so I met
                                       the State's attorney himself, while another lady came whose name I couldn't
                                       understand. I'll call her X. She got quite heated about it after I had
                                       explained the requisition, thought no action ought to be taken except at the
                                       suggestion of the Secretary. Mrs. Holman said there was no secretary. X
                                       answered that it ought not to be brought up except at the next meeting. But
                                       there is nothing to meet said Mrs. Holman. But said X, a meeting has been
                                       called for next Tuesday. If Mrs. Holman had any hesitation about signing,
                                       this woman's talk evidently decided her to do so for when X said there were
                                       two factions and she thought they ought to come together, she said that

            <p><a name="d0e4441"></a>was just the purpose of this requisition and walked off to sign it. X said
                                       she thought nothing ought to be done in an underhand way but overboard with
                                       which I entirely agreed. She is the only one I have run across that has not
                                       been entirely in sympathy. So far as I can make out there is a very
                                       widespread opinion that the Town Planning Association is in the wrong hands
                                       and is being run for interested motives. I really think this is helping put
                                       you straight before the reputable element of Sydney.

            <p><a name="d0e4444"></a>After that I went to Mrs. Milner's home. Her sister and Lady Lyne were there
                                       and I find Lady Lyne is a very pleasant and wide awake woman. Mrs. Milner
                                       said she had been inundated with petitions and pamphlets to which she had
                                       paid no attention. I had feared she was one of those who would wish to drop
                                       out. But all three signed very willingly. A number of names have been given
                                       to me and it looks as if we should have our 20 names by the end of the week.

            <p><a name="d0e4447"></a>Miss Sulman called me up last night and asked me if I was going to the
                                       Citizens Association Thursday. I told her I was and she said she would be on
                                       the lookout for me there. I don't think her father gave her very particular
                                       details of the meeting though the facts have been more or less in the
                                       papers. Mrs. Milner told me the Friday Evening News said, Mrs. Taylor got up
                                       and resigned but her husband grabbed her and said, "Don't do that," and she
                                       sat down. The women as a whole are quite resentful of being made fools of
                                       and do not as a whole seem inclined to lie down under it. And there seems to
                                       be a feeling that they ought to be taking part in governmental work. Maybe
                                       they'll take a hold of things yet and make some fur fly. Politics is very
                                       fatiguing so I am going to bed. Got your letter this afternoon. So glad you
                                       got a berth. Your lovingest wife, Marion.

                                       pleasant and noncontroversial topics of conversation. Couldn't talk about
                                       the war of course. Couldn't mention the U.S.A. Couldn't talk about you. We
                                       finally decided that the only safe subject would be the expected baby. So we
                                       were going to ask him whether he thought Alstan a better name for a boy or a
                                       girl, and since that was the only name we had been able to decide on, what
                                       would he advise us to do if it were twins.

                                       ladies have been to me about it. We want to maintain our womanliness. We
                                       want to spare you any humiliation. We can. A number of the ladies have
                                       spoken to me about it. The men decided your motion was all out of order.

            <p><a name="d0e4539"></a>Mrs. T.- Why, no he can't come over there. You know I made you

                                       decency to resign. You were made vice-president not because of your
                                       popularity. I suppose you know that. But you -

            <p><a name="d0e4554"></a>Here I hung up the receiver. A pity too because of course I know <u>she</u> made me vice-president (an interesting confession of
                                       the truth of Mrs. Rutter's statement) because of the advertising value of
                                       Walter Burley Griffin's name, and it would have been interesting to hear
                                       just how she would put it.

                                       find out who it was and if it were the T's say I couldn't come to the phone
                                       just now. Would they leave a message? But it was Miss Sulman to say that if
                                       I was going to be at home she and her father would like to come over in the
                                       afternoon. I told her I was delighted and tried to get them to stay to
                                       dinner but they are coming earlier. They know you are not here. I bet Taylor
                                       called him up to get him to take me in hand. Anyhow he is the president of
                                       the Town Planning Association and I shall ask him what report was made to
                                       the association. I told Miss Sulman I'd be glad to have a talk with her
                                       father and I know they will expect me to bring up the subject. I shall leave
                                       out all the spice and make no personal remarks but if he wants the facts of
                                       our last meeting I'll give them to him still without spice, and without
                                       using any names except those who made the motions. He probably knows he
                                       can't get facts from the Taylors, and I shall ask him if the council is
                                       going to hold a joint meeting with us as we asked.

                                       about the Melbourne matter Mr. Sulman told me that they were planning to
                                       have some one of them go down to do what they could for you before the Works
                                       Committee. He didn't know whether it would be himself or Taylor. I would
                                       hate to think he would be guilty of a deliberate veiled threat like that but
                                       he certainly laid himself open to suspicion. I told him that it was not yet
                                       decided that the plan should be laid before the Works Committee. He said he
                                       thought that had been settled. (Of course it never was laid before the Works

            <p><a name="d0e4591"></a>Snaefell, 25 May, 1915 - Dear Walter. Couldn't get away even in time to see
                                       you off, at the railroad station. Got into town at eight ten and caught the
                                       eight thirty ferry. Mr. and Mrs. Cooper are both very pleasant and direct
                                       people. We met them at that dinner at Mrs. McCauley's when we were at
                                       Coogee. They didn't hesitate to express themselves very frankly about the
                                       Taylors and the McCauley Hyman bunch. They got right down to business to
                                       find out the facts, for as Mrs. Cooper said she didn't care what she said.
                                       She just wanted to be sure of her ground. She learned what was brewing at
                                       the meeting of the delegation of the women for tree planting at Randwick at
                                       which meeting the Randwick branch was formed. They were told there that Mrs.
                                       Griffin was trying to run them into an American scheme. "Why," said Mrs.
                                       Taylor, "that's a verbatim copy of the Hull House constitution."

            <p><a name="d0e4597"></a>As Mrs. Cooper said, "What if it was!" Mrs. Hyman told Mrs. Cooper they
                                       thought I ought to resign. "Nonsense," said Mrs. Cooper. "She ought to be

                                       whole bunch." Mr. Cooper is going to join the Town Planning Association so
                                       that if the matter is referred to a Special Meeting of the members he can be
                                       on hand to help his wife. She is entirely ready to bring up the points. She
                                       said Mrs. Lee Brown was in sympathy with our attempt to organize but had
                                       told her that she had been told there was going to be a big fight and
                                       thought she wouldn't come to this meeting. Mrs. Cooper told her she ought to
                                       come if she did nothing more than cast a vote. Said she would try to see
                                       that she came.

            <p><a name="d0e4614"></a>Snaefell - 25 May <a name="92"></a> [Note: 1915] - Dear Walter, The boat is a day late so
                                       we don't get our mail till tomorrow or probably the next morning. In the
                                       excitement of this afternoon I forgot to mail my letter to you. Five of us
                                       went to the Civil Service for tea after, and then Miss Geach and I went to
                                       the quay together and just caught a ferry.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4620"></a>It is impossible to do justice to this afternoon's meeting and it now only
                                       remains to wipe the scandal of the central organization out as completely. I
                                       don't know whether the women will want to take the trouble to do that or
                                       not. We are going to try them on a motion for a Special meeting of the
                                       Central Association. Today it was Mrs. Holman, wife of the Prime Minister
                                           <a name="93"></a> [Note: Premier] of New South Wales who brought things to a crisis.
                                       Mr. Sulman took the chair, dismissed my case with a word, said Mr. Taylor
                                       would explain matters to us. He got up and told us how undesirable it would
                                       be to look to Canada or the United States for inspiration in Town Planning
                                       questions, told us how many great Town Planning experts there were in the
                                       Council, your name not being on the list, and how phenomenally successful
                                       was the work of the Women's Committee.

            <p><a name="d0e4626"></a>When he got through Mrs. Holman rose looking her stunningest and said she
                                       really didn't know what kind of an association this was, that she had been
                                       asked to preside, and notices to that effect had been sent out, but that
                                       when she comes she finds that someone else takes the chair, no explanation
                                       is made to her, and she doesn't knew what is going on. That she is a very
                                       busy woman, too busy to have her time taken in such a way and that she
                                       resigned her office. A deadly silence fell on

            <p><a name="d0e4634"></a>the meeting as she left the room. The men, consisting by the way of Sulman,
                                       Taylor, O'Carrol and Major Stowe, certainly did look abashed. Could you have
                                       imagined they would have been so stupid as to have tried to handle Mrs.
                                       Holman so crudely.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4637"></a>I immediately rose and said that considering the stand Mrs. Holman had taken
                                       I thought the thing to do was for all the officers to resign that an
                                       election might take place under circumstances that could be clearly
                                       understood so that no misunderstandings could arise. I therefore resigned my
                                       office. Taylor and Hyman followed suit. McCauley wasn't there. So what I
                                       didn't dream could be accomplished was done and there are no officers of the
                                       Town Planning Association women's branch. Several of the ladies were out in
                                       the hall with Mrs. Holman. They motioned me to come out. "What's all this
                                       about," said Mrs. Holman. "It's a scandal," I said, "and I'm deeply grateful
                                       to you for opening the way out." "Well good," she said.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4640"></a>I returned and the discussion that followed was lively. After some five
                                       minutes Mrs. Milner slipped in at my side and asked if she could propose my
                                       name as a member of the Women's National Association. I said I should be
                                       proud to have her do so. She said I would be in my proper place there, that
                                       "those people" were utterly impossible.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4643"></a>It would take a long time to report the afternoon's performance but the gist
                                       of it was that Mrs. Chris Thomas, Miss Geach and Mrs. Copper asked a lot of
                                       very pertinent questions and made a number of direct remarks and if those
                                       men felt as foolish as they looked they could not have had a very
                                       comfortable time. The ladies made it clear that they did not intend to stand
                                       for being pulled around by the nose like a bunch of children as Mrs. Thomas
                                       put it, that if they were not a Branch but a Committee as the men put it,
                                       saying they could not have Presidents and vice-presidents, that the
                                       constitution did not provide for Committees except of Council members and
                                       therefore the motion of the Council forming us was out of order, that to
                                       have an organization of two hundred or so members with one hundred women
                                       without

            <p><a name="d0e4651"></a>representation was not fair and that it was desirable to have some amendment
                                       of the Constitution and that it was desirable that the suggestions for
                                       organization made should be considered.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4654"></a>Before the meeting Sulman came to me and said - Then I am to say that you
                                       recall your motion. No, I said, I had told him before that it was the motion
                                       of Miss Geach and Mrs. Thomas. When he opened the meeting he said - the
                                       notice says there is a motion of Mrs. Griffin's to be considered. Is that
                                       the case Mrs. Griffin? I got up and said that the motion I had made had not
                                       been seconded nor passed and that therefore I did not have a motion before
                                       the meeting. On the spur of the moment, since I knew the facts, I left it
                                       there instead of explaining that I had accepted Mrs. Thomas's modification.
                                       It later exposed their duplicity but at the time it flabbergasted Mrs.
                                       Thomas. But the fact that my suggestion had been informal and that the
                                       motion had been made by Mrs. Thomas was stated in the minutes which Mr.
                                       Sulman read a little later. Toward the end of the meeting when questioned by
                                       the women as to why the matter for which this meeting had been called had
                                       not been taken up he said again that I said I had no motion therefore there
                                       was no special business. Then I got up and said that was misrepresentation
                                       as I had told Mr. Sulman of the status of my motion and of Mrs. Thomas and
                                       Miss Geach whose motion as recorded in the minutes was the business of this
                                       meeting. I think that cleared me with Mrs. Thomas.

            <p><a name="d0e4657"></a>Major Stowe made quite a speech saying what valuable work the women were
                                       doing in the matter of wash tubs with which he had come to have an
                                       appreciative feeling since he had been in military service - at which
                                       several ladies snickered - that it was foolish for us to bother our heads
                                       with matters of legislation, that was for the future, that he must say that
                                       some suggestions that had been made made him sick. Mrs. Thomas after the
                                       meeting asked him what it was that had made him sick. She also asked Mr.
                                       Sulman if they had had any legal advice and suggested it might be well for
                                       them to get a few legal minds on their council.

            <p><a name="d0e4665"></a>Dear Walter - Had a good talk with Mrs. Holman yesterday. Apparently she has
                                       no intention of rescinding her resignation though Mr. Fitzgerald had been to
                                       her and asked that, as a special favor to him, she would. She told him that
                                       she couldn't see how, personal feeling aside, she could subject her
                                       husband's office (Mr. Holman, Premier of the state of New South Wales) to
                                       such hazards whether they arose from malice or ignorance. She approves of
                                       taking the matter to a Special Meeting and gave me several names to take the
                                       requisition to. When I said I thought Mr. Sulman would be relieved if we
                                       women pushed the thing through and got the central body out of the rut, she
                                       lifted her eyebrow and said "Do you think so?"
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4668"></a>She says that they have been full of explanations since, the stories don't
                                       sound good to her. Mr. Sulman had profusely apologized but Mrs. Taylor had
                                       said to her that coming up on the train <u>she</u> had told Mr.

            <p><a name="d0e4680"></a>22 July 1915 - Dear Walter, Received a letter from Mr. Sulman today with the
                                       apology of the Town Planning Association council and enclosing apology from
                                       Stowe. Could not ask for a nicer letter from Council though it is easy to
                                       guess their feelings. I have answered that I was very glad indeed to receive
                                       the letter from him and the enclosure from Major Stowe. Thanking him for his
                                       courtesy. Mrs. Weston called me up saying she had heard of Stowe's letter.
                                       Said she had been talking it all over with her husband who utterly condemned
                                       the things they were doing and considered them very serious. Said she
                                       appreciated that if it hadn't been for me they wouldn't have realized the
                                       sort of hands they had fallen into. Asked me to

                                       appears that Major Stowe returned your subscription as a member. In
                                       connection therewith the following resolution was carried and I was asked to
                                       forward the came to you.

                                       of the Council for the unauthorized action of the Honorary Treasurer as set
                                       out in his letters to them dated July 15th and informs them that this
                                       Association welcomes their membership and regrets exceedingly the pain

                                       return. So I expected to be quizzed for copy. But nothing of the kind
                                       happened. He is an old bachelor and is writing historical accounts of early
                                       Australia, etc., and was a very pleasant host. The trip was for all day to
                                       Pittwater where he has a lot on which he is postponing building because of
                                       the war. He took us about in a launch. A perfectly beautiful body of water.
                                       There were occasional showers with the lights continually changing from mist
                                       to sunshine, a really miraculous day to the eye. I know he wants to meet you
                                       so I told him I would try to get him over to the house as soon as I could
                                       catch you. He suggested several walks which he said he would gladly guide us
                                       on any time we called him up. Must scurry this over to the Post Office. A

                                       by dumping city roughage. The town planner made use of this by making its

                                       to stand on the top of this precipice making this vista from the valley
                                       sightly and attractive, harmonious with the rest of the group, and giving
                                       the houses a raking view of the valley.

                                       Federal Capital, is arousing great interest and is giving people an inkling
                                       of the fact that interest in architecture need not be limited to the
                                       technically initiated but can give real joy to everyone as music does. It
                                       will help the average citizen to realize that his Federal Capital may afford
                                       him the same sort of intense personal pleasure as he would get from a
                                       concert and be not merely a thing for abstract pride based on the opinion
                                       dictated to him by a cult which he has been taught that he must respect, why

            <p><a name="d0e4856"></a>The problem - a cafe - calls for the arresting of the attention of the
                                       passer-by, and this one certainly does it. In the midst of the dull tints of
                                       the business buildings of the street, the clear positive tones arrest the
                                       eye - green pearl granite, black like the purple grackle's plumage, and in
                                       the same way - with iridescent tints - really a porphyry rather than a
                                       granite, which more than one passer-by stops to touch wondering just what it
                                       is; taking a polish which is permanent as no black marble could be when so
                                       exposed; recessed fillets of Delft tile, gold burned on, arched over by a
                                       fanciful square arch of white quartz granite whose pointed voussoirs extend
                                       through the vaulted vestibule the center one becoming the lighting fixture
                                       of the entrance. These materials set the key-note for the color scheme of
                                       the whole in gold and ivory, a quiet though rich background for all colors
                                       whether in floral decoration or in ladies' costume.

                                       Australian architecture, for style is purely an historical question and

                                       wants to go on a bit to see more completely an attraction which the eye

                                       rhythm - is not only met but is sensed by those of an analytical turn of
                                       mind:- "The surprising thing about this place is how big it looks. When you
                                       pace it off you find the distances are not great, but it seems so spacious!"
                                       This is accomplished not only by illusiveness of form and scale but by most
                                       careful selection of color values, soft ivories to rich ambers glowing yet

                                       architectural requirements absolutely, satisfied with nothing short of
                                       perfection. She has produced a group of girlish figures - Persephone, Echo
                                       and Daphne of exquisite freshness and spirit. Anyway perhaps it takes a
                                       woman to model a woman.

            <p><a name="d0e4941"></a>The motif in these piers is illusive again. Under the projecting light shelf
                                       of each of these piers is the single figure stepping lightly through a field
                                       of grain with a background of tree foliage - the orange, the almond, the
                                       cherry - which foliage is apparently carried through to the opposite side,
                                       facing the fountain court where the tree itself becomes the motif of the
                                       panel and forms a rich decoration balancing the figures opposite.

            <p><a name="d0e4944"></a>The architectural motifs carried throughout are the triangle, the circle and
                                       the thorny vine. Used in piers where the conventional cap has been entirely
                                       abolished, the decoration is carried the full length of the pier - very rich
                                       in effect.

                                       the world. It is certainly unique. It introduced Griffin to Australia
                                       because it was the first completed work of his over there. It occupied the
                                       ground floor of a down town building under the light well of the building
                                       and consisted of five rooms separated not by walls but by great piers which
                                       carried the structure of the building above.

            <p><a name="d0e4977"></a>It is lighted in part by the open vaulted grill under the light well and
                                       partly by stained glass ceiling panels screening electric lamps. The tiles
                                       used are real gold delft tiles brought from Holland. The sculpture was done
                                       by Miss Baskerville of Melbourne and the mural decoration by Miss Merfield
                                       of Melbourne.]

                                       ever-varying prismatic lights glowing in the water and reflecting in the

                                       greenery. To one side of these rooms is the grand staircase leading to the
                                       balcony of the Dining Hall. Here the motive of the piers is used for newel
                                       posts surmounted by great bowls of palms and flowers and drooping vines.

                                       broad light shelf which forms the strong line connecting all the rooms. In
                                       the Dining Hall it is developed into a balcony richly decorated with a
                                       series of light standards rising from it forming flamboyant light fixtures
                                       pierced just enough to direct light to penetrate and give a jeweled effect.

            <p><a name="d0e5033"></a>Griffin's private office was always very busy. He had contractual right with
                                       the government to give half his time to his private practice. It seemed the
                                       last straw when, although Canberra was absorbing the whole of his days and
                                       more, he took on the job of remodeling the interior of one of the city'
                                       buildings on Collins Street for Mr. Lucas who afterward became the Greek
                                       Consul-General in Australia. Mr. Lucas and his wife were making a good
                                       living in the restaurant business but the class of his work was totally
                                       transformed by the Character of this Cafe Australia for the beauty obtained
                                       through the dignity and richness of design rather than the expenditure of
                                       large sums woke up Melbourne; and the elite of the city, including Dame
                                       Melba <a name="112"></a> [Note: Nellie Melba, noted Australian-born soprano], not only
                                       came to the opening banquet but became habitues. It was the first step in
                                       the transformation of the dingy Australian housing of these daily
                                       necessities of life. Thus does architecture influence the whole character of
                                       a community quite apart from its influence as architect on fellow
                                       architects. The other cafes were naturally losing their custom to Mr. Lucas.
                                       Mr. Lucas expressed his appreciation by thanking Mr. Griffin and saying he
                                       had made a "gentleman" of him. A true gentleman Mr. Lucas had always been
                                       from the American point of view.

                                       principles and its luxuriance. She is the sculptress who did the three
                                       lovely Greek figures - Daphne, Echo, &amp; Persephone - in full relief
                                       on the three heavy piers which one faces as he comes down the grand stairway
                                       from the balcony. These could hold their own in any comparison with Greek
                                       work of this type, each of these lovely beings stepping forth from the

                                       we desired for these three figures. The Center one was Echo, blowing her
                                       horn. When I went over to her studio to see the progress on this one I found
                                       to my consternation that she had not molded her facing directly forward as I
                                       had sketched but for the sake of grace had turned her body slightly. The
                                       work was so far advanced that I could hardly bring myself to raise
                                       objections but since I was responsible to Mr. Griffin in this matter I
                                       overcame my shyness and explained how from an architectural point or view
                                       this central figure, directly opposite the stairway, must be markedly
                                       different from Daphne and Persephone on either side and must be running
                                       straight forward toward the descending patrons. She saw the point and
                                       without a qualm ripped out the figure and built her up anew.

                                       stand as mediator between Mr. Griffin who, as designer, had of course to
                                       make all decisions, and the office force. We two could get together only at
                                       night when I could put before him each issue and get his instructions and
                                       designs for carrying on the work. And then the task of getting decisions
                                       from Mr. Lucas! How could he be expected to understand what was being put
                                       before him? I remember the last struggle to get the authority to put the
                                       whole thing in hand. We had dinner at his cafe and had talked till after
                                       midnight when be said, "Well go ahead." We went home and Mr. Griffin
                                       immediately went to the telephone and called up the contractor, told him to
                                       have material on hand and work started early the next morning. The
                                       contractor, knowing the nature of some of the struggles for decisions, did
                                       as told and materials were being piled up and work was in hand by six
                                       o'clock in the morning which was well since by ten o'clock Mr. Lucas was
                                       ringing Mr. Griffin to say he did not think he could go on with the work. As
                                       you have seen, in the end he was well satisfied. It was in fact his natural
                                       temperament to be frightened in the making of a decision. But he was not an
                                       Anglo Saxon so was able to appreciate beauty as it developed. He became one
                                       of Mr. Griffin's continual clients.

                                       opportunity to Chicago commuters at a distance of 28 miles from the city to
                                       make use of their limited hours of freedom in a more substantial form of
                                       recreation than mere pleasure seeking. Under such conditions farming is
                                       properly an intensive craft and not another species of executive distraction
                                       to add to those of the organizations with which these commuters are
                                       identified in the city itself. The prime objects in the scheme of this group
                                       is then the maximum of convenience for the work of each plot for a minimum
                                       of expense in equipment and help, utilizing the various modern public
                                       services obtainable from the town with which it is connected. However,
                                       health and enjoyment of mind and body before pecuniary profits are
                                       objectives demanding natural rural attractiveness.

            <p><a name="d0e5160"></a>Broadways are run in easy sweeps with the sharper curvatures concealing the
                                       steeper ascents. Tangential intersections permit narrow traffic ways with
                                       easy turns at the same time affording frequent wooded park spaces,
                                       preserving the rural character, offering shelter, diversifying the views,
                                       increasing the floral variety and adding means for passing or turning
                                       vehicles. The plot in the south east corner is given over for children.

                                       space and greatly enhanced view and air provision for all, with each owner
                                       left with the same street frontage and a depth of 100 feet for exclusive
                                       use. The advantages of placing each building in a direction parallel to its
                                       lot and park frontage is that this arrangement gives maximum benefit of the

            <p><a name="d0e5198"></a>In the fall of 1910 the Commonwealth of Australia prepared to invite
                                       competitive designs for laying out a proposed new Federal Capital City at
                                       Canberra, a naturally beautiful site selected in New South Wales, requiring
                                       locations for a vice-regal residence, Capitol and Parliamentary buildings,
                                       public offices, university, station, citadel and military barracks;
                                       residential, municipal, market and manufacturing centers, and other groups
                                       of public and private buildings, as well as possible locations for
                                       particular interests and trades properly disposed within the city area.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5201"></a>The site lies in a valley between three hills of considerable elevation -
                                       "Ainslie," "Black Mountain," and "Mugga-Mugga," - with the peak of Bimberi
                                       importantly dominating the landscape thirty miles away and nearly south of
                                       the city. A portion of the valley is occupied by waterways that have been
                                       partially formalized and adapted to the purposes of Mr. Griffin's plan by
                                       some retaining dikes, used also as avenues of connection. Reference to the
                                       detailed plan shows how the series of hexagonal and octagonal units give
                                       convenient relation between the various parts of the city.

            <p><a name="d0e5222"></a>The long vista of government and municipal buildings is on the axis
                                       established by Mount Ainslie at the north east and Bimberi Peak at the
                                       southwest. The vista along the waterway cuts across this axis at right
                                       angles - from Black Mountain at the northwest to Lake Park on the southeast.
                                       To the north are located the agricultural suburbs, with a market center and
                                       military group east of the central basin - which, on its northern side, is
                                       bordered by the museums and Public Gardens - to balance the university and
                                       municipal centers in a corresponding location on the west. Directly north
                                       are the manufacturing suburbs and railway yards; and the principal
                                       residential center is between Mugga-Mugga and Black Mountain, at the west of
                                       the Capitol building. It is easy to realize how well the plan has been
                                       adapted to the natural features of the site. The forested ranges and distant
                                       snow-covered peaks to the south and west provide a panoramic background; the
                                       three local mountains within the city, which have been retained in their
                                       natural state, as well as the lesser hills, utilized as sites for the
                                       important groups, all end thoroughfare vistas, - while the needed waterways
                                       have been utilized to increase the architectural effect of the principal
                                       groups - and the flatter valleys or plateaus have been retained for
                                       industrial or residential purposes. The principal water-basin, the
                                       "Molonglo," near Black Mountain Reservation, remains in its present wild
                                       state; the more formal basins being shut off by the dam and roadway that
                                       flood the large central basin, utilized for equalizing the conditions of
                                       humidity in the city, and for architectural effect.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5225"></a>The plan is dominated by those considerations of space that rendered Paris
                                       and Washington so impressively effective, and were also peculiarly adaptable
                                       to the large scale and natural grandeur of the selected site; while
                                       permitting the more important buildings to be correspondingly large in scale
                                       in the areas they cover - thus providing adequate floor space without
                                       extending the buildings to an undue and disproportionate height.

                                       city and distant landscape. The Parliamentary buildings occupy a lower-lying

                                       to the Casino and Ainslie at its opposite end. The Parliament plateau is 40
                                       feet above the courtyard below, which in turn lies 25 feet above the lowest

            <p><a name="d0e5259"></a>Of course, all planning being such, this paper can only direct attention to
                                       certain features not always recognized. This subject, however, is not so
                                       trite as it should be, and would be, were it not for very many persistent
                                       and prevailing notions set arbitrarily by general governmental practice and
                                       immediately by the dominant military standards superimposed upon the already
                                       heavy load of habits and fixed ideas that have extended unsuitable and
                                       obsolete practice from generation to generation.

            <p><a name="d0e5262"></a>The present cry for economy, if made and taken seriously, and understood,
                                       would not, to a town planner's mind, be a matter for regret, but of promise,
                                       and would point the way to sloughing off many impediments that otherwise are
                                       likely to bring us down in the end. Really it cannot then mean general
                                       parsimony, but a launching out in new and greater undertakings than ever,
                                       when we begin to realize what superfluous and futile effort has so far
                                       engaged us and absorbed the investment of our stupendous output and
                                       prevented our benefiting from the technical knowledge and mechanical powers
                                       we have been so busily accumulating, and as busily applying blindly with no
                                       comprehensive sense of economy and, therefore, little or no ultimate or
                                       tangible good in time of peace, and only infinite harm in war.

                                       alternative to planning for economy in its broadest sense? Our duty was once
                                       said to be to direct the great sources of power in nature to the use and
                                       convenience of man, but it has since been pointed that it is now fully as
                                       much our function as planners, as engineers, to determine what not to do,
                                       what not to construct, in order best to meet the use and convenience of man;
                                       that is to relieve him of the burdens of improper or superadaption
                                           <a name="117"></a> [Note: improper superadaptation?] of nature, that a civilization
                                       may be making worse even than the under-development of primitive and simple
                                       life. The expenditures at Canberra were an instance of exceptional precocity

                                       has been for the average man to earn comfort, is it not evident that real

                                       adding more and still more gain to the waste, but rather to find how, in
                                       peace, to stop frittering away such possible surplus without tangible
                                       benefit in ways that do not make living better or easier on the whole; to

                                       mind is already demonstrating ascendancy over the qualitative - as, for
                                       instance, in economizing effort in certain phases of industrial management,
                                       shop practice; yet the ultimate result may be nil if the thing accomplished
                                       is not a means to the general betterment. I am convinced that half that
                                       study applied to the simple workshop of every house would release half
                                       humanity of half its burdens; but time is lacking to get into that study
                                       here. There is as yet, however, little evidence of any definite progress
                                       toward deliberately conserving efforts or resources in systematizing such
                                       comprehensive undertakings as our communities, cities or countries which
                                       comprise and control the whole of modern investment.

            <p><a name="d0e5282"></a>We should be aware that, at the root of the many fundamental difficulties of
                                       distribution - such as, for instance, the wasteful distances over idle
                                       valuable areas to a remote and difficult margin of cultivation - lie in the
                                       current conceptions of political economy and the scope of the state; but
                                       these must be passed over, for the proper concern of this Conference is only

                                       theories, we have heard a great deal in the town planning movement, but with
                                       very small resultant improvement, partly because we are habitually floating,
                                       more or less, in nebulous, if delightful, discussions over emotions,
                                       esthetics, tastes and distastes - the innumerable abstractions and
                                       glittering generalities that will not permit of quantitative comparisons or
                                       demonstration of actual relative values for given expenditures on the land
                                       for definite purposes. If this were not so we would be little distracted
                                       over "classic," "medieval," or for that matter "modern" obsolete practices
                                       in Europe, which cannot possibly serve as direct criteria of present town

                                       generation will have to learn that preparedness for meeting the new
                                       community problems can no more grow out of general and erudite consideration
                                       than could sculpture arise out of literary critiques. It must arise out of
                                       experiments and progressive accomplishments in the art itself and their
                                       demonstrated effectiveness - greater or less - and their mistakes. Criticism
                                       can no better anticipate Creation than multiplicity of council can effect
                                       it. I take it as accepted in the modern educational system that we learn to
                                       do by doing. Advance is, consequently, to be expected only where greatest

                                       minimum for single or double houses; but such a generalization is only a

            <p><a name="d0e5367"></a>As to business premises we might well now also conclude that a whole city
                                       frontage between two street intersections is properly a single unit for
                                       development; and in the most modern practice this has become the fact,
                                       requiring no illustration, from the many department stores, public markets,
                                       exhibition and industrial buildings and largest office buildings, as well as
                                       public administration buildings. These with their immense scale and powerful
                                       repetition have advanced far enough now as to point the way to a dignified
                                       city whose architecture need not be lost in a maze of contradictory
                                       fragments - for single fronts cannot accomplish architecture if it is an art
                                       of three dimensions. Concentration of facilities and services, adequate
                                       light courts, repetition of standard forms, avoiding bulky and often
                                       duplicated duplication division walls, and securing convenience of internal
                                       communication, have made such development so attractive that splendid
                                       monumental modern skyscraping buildings, on one or several allotments, have
                                       frequently been scrapped, after less than 15 years' life, to permit larger
                                       and more profitable ones of no greater height.

                                       No. 8, a glance at the rolling character of the ground shows how the
                                       money-absorbing drainage problems arise out of a simple specimen of the
                                       usual automatic extension of the gridiron plan of a city; and a comparison
                                       of the alternatives also shows the simple means required to avoid all the
                                       difficulties, by conforming the features to the natural topography for
                                       proper grades without earthwork, producing sites everywhere high in respect
                                       to their frontages and outlooks, yet all in strict order, in a parklike,
                                       informal environment, and with routes accentuated with parks, but direct and
                                       without barren deserts of pavements or objectiveless treadmill inclined
                                       planes. There is, in addition, a neighborly system of inter-communication.
                                       The most striking point, however, is that in the original subdivision there
                                       were only 57 lots - thirty averaging 50 feet wide and 29 averaging 75 feet
                                       wide - whilst as revised there are 66 lots of the same average depth but
                                       with 64 of 75 feet width and only 2 of 50 feet width, the resultant area in
                                       salable lots at the same rate representing an increase in value of
                                       $10,500.00 - an increase in saleable frontage of 30.6 per cent over the

                                       depth as compared with the previous subdivision of the same tract amounts to

            <p><a name="d0e5603"></a>The resubdivision of Janey's addition to Grinnell, Iowa, was brought about
                                       when, after some 8 lots had been sold, it became apparent that the sewer
                                       problem of the old rectangular arrangement was about to involve an
                                       expenditure entirely disproportionate to the whole undertaking.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5606"></a>The original plat consisted in a purely mechanical extension of the typical
                                       layout that comprises the whole of the city which, although a rolling
                                       prairie, has not in general quite the same degree of accentuation of the
                                       hill and vale that characterizes this twenty acre tract.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5609"></a>For the purpose of comparison of the two methods of platting we may disregard
                                       the very obvious advantages of following the ravines with roadways by which
                                       the excavation for the underground service equipment is merely a matter of
                                       frost line; of lots uniformly high relative to the street and its outlooks;
                                       and of that treatment whereby the informality of the rolling disposition is
                                       accentuated by the parklike character of the roadways, paths and terminal
                                       parkings all of which are in contrast with the brutal mutilation of the
                                       natural advantages by the typical rectangular extension, its expensive lots
                                       to be filled or graded down with abrupt and steep grades and barren deserts
                                       of pavements, monotonous views and staccato buildings repetition, ungainly
                                       slopes to descend or treadmill inclined plane to climb with no stimulus to
                                       the imagination in prospect.

            <p><a name="d0e5612"></a>That the differences in economy of equipment are real and very great no one
                                       will deny. They were the inducements to the undertaking of this
                                       resubdivision; but disregarding not only these very obvious items but also
                                       the less tangible values accruing from the aesthetic attractions and the
                                       natural adaptation of groups to the beautiful hill and vale which will
                                       induce the influx to this property

                                       looking to the proposition merely as a real estate man wanting the greatest
                                       quantity of salable plots on paper, a comparison between the two schemes is
                                       still startling as to the primitive inexcusable deficiency in our regulation

                                       of them had been sold and had to be bought back in order to permit the
                                       resubdivision to proceed, applying these values to the lots in the
                                       corresponding location of the 66 parcels of the new resubdivision, we find a
                                       total increase in the salable land area of Clark's Resubdivision aggregating
                                       $10,500 as compared with the valuation of Janey's subdivision. In other
                                       words, the total increase in lots of the same average depth of the Clark
                                       resubdivision as compared with the previous Janey subdivision of the same
                                       tract amounts to 30.6%. This latter frontage is so distributed as to
                                       increase the total number of lots from 57 to 66 while the minimum frontage
                                       is 75 feet throughout (except two 50 foot lots) whereas formerly half the
                                       lots approximated only 50 feet frontage each and only the remaining 29
                                       averaged 75 feet frontage.

                                       for the welfare, in fact, of a class or clique in each nationality or group.

                                       which finally effectively turned the minds of the people against it.

            <p><a name="d0e5755"></a>Here is the great lesson for us with regard to propaganda of reform. Few men
                                       can or will listen to reason. Controversy will always divide them and is,
                                       for that reason, the mainstay of the politicians and parties. Preaching is
                                       offensive to "amour propre" and, consequently, penetrates but slightly. Only
                                       the subtleties - art, the sensual satisfaction in form or expression, is
                                       capable of getting under the protective armor of the average ego to affect
                                       his ideas or ideals. Make no mistake, the elimination of the pernicious
                                       power of the State to coerce and mold the people will come only through the
                                       ablest writers, story-tellers, playwrights, scenario makers and picture
                                       designers!

                                       one feature - the existence of a possessing and a dispossessed class with
                                       regard to the economic basis of existence - access to the earth. This
                                       classification is what supports the governments as they are and it is idle
                                       to expect, therefore, that any of these governments will abandon its
                                       foundation on privileged interests. Changing the form, the representation,
                                       the personal have all been tried and always failed to effect the fundamental
                                       change.

                                       essential function of government as it is, that operates to stifle the
                                       development of the individual and, consequently, the advance of society and
                                       mankind, it will only suffice to give that knowledge to the underlying
                                       population. I have tried to show, too, the only way, in the face of the
                                       difficulties of this situation, that a new idea may be implanted under the
                                       skin of the ego.

                                       had been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of the

                                       attempts to solve the social problem of our time. We are tempted to copy
                                       them. But failure would meet us as it has them over there. We are faced with
                                       a critical testing time and situation. Are we going to try Europe's methods
                                       or are going to do as the founders of this country did and achieve real
                                       creative thinking? In those days an independent America was established on
                                       an entirely new concept, the concept that the function of government,
                                       political government, was to maintain equity. Nowhere else is that the case
                                       for the establishment of government to maintain the welfare of the people is
                                       the diametric opposite of this and always leads to war.

            <p><a name="d0e5860"></a>The founders also put the choice of the executive in the hands of the people.
                                       Nowhere else is that the case. The parliamentary form of government gives no
                                       possibility of popular control and the powers of imperialism rest secure
                                       behind this screen set up between the people and the permanent bureaucracy,
                                       civil and military, and imperialism continues. No screened power can throw
                                       out of office a president of the United States.

            <p><a name="d0e5863"></a>We are now witnessing in Europe a rebirth on modern lines of the same old
                                       imperial sway which, always based on the liaison of political and economic
                                       institutions, now recognizes the necessity of accepting modernism in
                                       economic affairs. The liaison continues. Only the emphasis has altered. The
                                       uniting of the conduct of economic affairs with the military, the police
                                       (necessary for the maintenance of equity as the traffic policeman) spells
                                       ruthless power. There is an alternative.

            <p><a name="d0e5952"></a>Will the Melbourne of fifty years hence be less beautiful than the Melbourne
                                       of today? Should the people of 1922 try to plan more artistically for the
                                       people of 1970? The question was suggested the other day when the chief
                                       engineer of Water Supply for the metropolitan board of works, Mr. Ritchie,
                                       drew a picture of Melbourne populated by 3,000,000 people in fifty years
                                       time. With the growth of interest in town planning, the average man perhaps
                                       with his sons will live in a finer and more majestic Melbourne than he
                                       himself inhabits today. An interesting, but gloomier view however is taken
                                       by Mr. W.B. Griffin the designer of the Federal Capital at Canberra. When
                                       asked for his view of the future Mr. Griffin said:-
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5955"></a>Personally I do not like to look forward to a tremendous increase of
                                       population in this city, for one gets less out of life in a very large city
                                       then in a comparatively smaller one. The main thing, after all, is to make
                                       Melbourne a better city. As the years go on it will certainly grow bigger
                                       and perhaps handsomer as far as the center of the metropolis is concerned.
                                       But I do not think that it will be more comfortable to live in than it is at
                                       present. Even with the electricity scheme in operation there must still be
                                       more dirt, though. I think the city will be a commercial, social and
                                       political nucleus rather than a huge industrial center. Its development will
                                       be, perhaps, along lines of trade and of light manufacture rather than of
                                       huge plants and extensive works.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5958"></a>Of course, with increase of population, larger buildings will have to be
                                       erected, doubtless taller and more substantial, but I am not sure they will
                                       necessarily be improved in appearance. It can hardly be said that the
                                       buildings erected by the present generation are any improvement,
                                       artistically, upon those put up by previous generations.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5961"></a>Considerations of expediency and quick return have been taking the place of
                                       pride and satisfaction in expressing civic ideals, and so only in
                                       utilitarian respects, I imagine, will the buildings of the near future be
                                       better than those of today.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5964"></a>As regards the type of structure, it is evident that the trend of opinion
                                       here today favors the reinforced concrete building, recent

            <p><a name="d0e5972"></a>examples of which may be seen in various parts of the city. The general
                                       character of such buildings is likely to change very little in the course of
                                       50 years, except in respect to scale and size which are artificially
                                       restricted just now by arbitrary tax graduations.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5975"></a>It must be remembered too that the state and municipal building regulations
                                       put a very strict limit upon any variation in design. To a great extent they
                                       crystallize previous practice and attempt to put the new wine of the future
                                       as far as possible into the old bottles of the past. Such attempted rigidity
                                       can only tend to a greater and greater monotony and similarity, and less and
                                       less individuality and experiment in the case of Melbourne buildings during
                                       the next 50 years.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5978"></a>From the artistic point of view there can be no change for the better except
                                       as a result of a change in the minds of the great bulk of the people
                                       themselves and, candidly, I think there is insufficient indication at
                                       present that the people are taking any interest in the matter, and of
                                       leaders in thought on architectural and artistic development. I do not wish
                                       to pose as a prophet but I do want to show the need for thinking in advance
                                       if people want a beautiful city 50 years hence. To achieve such an object
                                       they should be doing creative thinking even if not planning today. The
                                       community is rather devoting its attention to the development of the
                                       individual advantage and power, and does not take seriously the fact of any
                                       real aesthetic needs, private or public.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5981"></a>Indeed, at the moment anyway, the influences making for beautification are
                                       growing rather fewer, not only here but in most places afflicted with our
                                       present political and industrial agencies for coercion and standardization.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5984"></a>I would like to see a better Melbourne in the future if not a very much
                                       larger Melbourne. I would like to see many of the smaller buildings pulled
                                       down, and more economic and efficient buildings erected in their place. But
                                       I do not look with great favor upon the growing domination of government and
                                       municipal authorities where

            <p><a name="d0e5992"></a>building or other creative activities are concerned. The past score of years
                                       witnesses distinct retrogression in public works and a tendency to
                                       stereotyped design in every class.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5995"></a>So the Melbourne of the next half century may be only somewhat similar to the
                                       city of today, possibly if not probably worse because more crowded and more
                                       monotonous. This is only because the city and architecture are a reflex of
                                       the life of the people. In modern life there is a growing tendency for men
                                       to become, more and more, employers and place holders rather than self
                                       dependent entities and independent citizens. Hence fewer minds are at work
                                       upon the problem of improving conditions for the community. The very inertia
                                       of bigness too makes the individual's effort so seemingly hopeless. The
                                       result already apparent is that less and less active interest is taken in
                                       the beautification or in any affairs that seem a long way ahead.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5998"></a>Sense of the beautiful, appreciation of finish and nicety in all things are
                                       not compatible with continuous struggle of individuals or classes for
                                       security from poverty, nor scramble for dominance, government billets or
                                       monopoly, because all these efforts are too feverish, too impatient, too
                                       anxious, too exhausting. So while they prevail the material expression of
                                       our era will continue more and more to be the sort of thing we see about us
                                       already.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6001"></a>Anyway, fifty years is a short time under modern conditions for aesthetic
                                       revolution on a very large scale. Not much more than enough to make general
                                       the accomplishment of things already worked out by individuals. Yet who now
                                       has reached the stage of a constructive, comprehensive architectural ideal
                                       for Melbourne? Such ideals in the mind of the far-seeing public-spirited
                                       few, where they can be proven practicable, even profitable, will take on
                                       eventually and it may be hoped that the next 50 years will see the
                                       foundation at any rate of a really different and not merely greater
                                       Melbourne for the time to follow.

                                       with space for recreation grounds around the center that can scarcely be
                                       matched. Altogether, apart from the aspect of beautification, if foresight
                                       is exercised, there is no reason why Melbourne should not escape in the
                                       future much of the dangers and discomfort associated in other great cities
                                       with crowded thoroughfares and dense and squalid slums.

            <p><a name="d0e6015"></a>Frequent suggestions for improvement along town-planning lines indicate that
                                       civic spirit is not dead but has only been sleeping. The proposal of Mr.
                                       James Alexander Smith before the Victorian Institute of Engineers to build
                                       municipal buildings in the center of the city over the massed railroads
                                       which come into Melbourne's only railway station has shown that the way to
                                       the creation of a much needed nucleus of Civic Development without delay or
                                       cost or disturbance of the rights or interests of any part of the public is
                                       practical and only awaits the awakening of public spirit.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6018"></a>Of course there will be a tendency for the city to spread out with the growth
                                       of new suburbs; and in this respect we are fortunate in possessing such
                                       magnificent beach frontages. Many suburbs will spring into existence along
                                       the bay. On the other hand, the natural beauties of ti tree groves as well
                                       as of the hills inland will hardly be greatly enhanced by increase of

                                       week-end habit, which is steadily growing and curtailing the attractiveness
                                       of much of nature among the gullies and bush covered hills.

                                       recognised as of a more appropriately dominant character, and is aligned
                                       with the terminus of the water axis at the foot of Black Mountain. The

                                       scope, surrounded by the inherently most attractive region of the City, is
                                       intersected by a little lagoon arm, bordered by the lowest lake, and at the
                                       same time overlooks the entire length of the other four of the chain. This
                                       site is also in a position to utilize the botanical gardens and mountain

                                       it is endeavoured to direct these lines on the site to such openings for
                                       actual application as are most available to them. Thus from Physiology, the

                                       equable temperature and favorable atmospheric conditions, is adjoined by the
                                       Medical, Surgical, and Pharmaceutic Schools. Thus Agriculture adjoins the
                                       Botanical Gardens and the Forestry Reserve. Into the base of Black Mountain
                                       extends Mining, while Engineering lies between it and Architecture &#8212; both of

                                       too exposed for building purposes), afford objective points of prospect to
                                       terminate great garden and water vistas, with conspicuous positions for
                                       future commemorative monuments, and conversely offer points of outlook over
                                       a city arranged in an orderly way with reference to them.

                                       eminences on the opposite side of the Molonglo suggested the lesser one of
                                       these vistas. The apposition of Black Mountain, with the general direction
                                       of the waterway and the broad prospect of the Queanbeyan Plains to the

            <p><a name="d0e6122"></a>Eminences rising to 200 feet furnish most appropriate public building sites
                                       to terminate main thoroughfares disposed with reference to them and often in
                                       apposition with the mountains also. The natural contribution of elevated
                                       foundations that may be treated in a variety of ways, formal and informal,
                                       is an asset for architectural impressiveness not to be wasted. These hills,
                                       however, are not considered to dictate either the public buildings, sites,
                                       or main thoroughfare lines, except in the light of other determining

                                       eminently suitable for a waterway of the largest extent that would be
                                       consistent with a location in the heart of the city, where only, on the
                                       other hand, a water feature of the restricted size procurable at Canberra
                                       can maintain a dignity in keeping with its purpose.

            <p><a name="d0e6131"></a>The practicability of maintaining a surface of 5 square miles of water is
                                       verified by all known data, provided proper precautions are taken in the
                                       head waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Moreover, there are
                                       additional river supplies available within the limits of expense
                                       proportionate to any unprecedented or possible need.

                                       protection to narrow skirtings, which occur in no considerable case within
                                       the city limits. Not more than one-sixth of the official site can be
                                       considered so protected, and that in instances too scattered and too rugged
                                       for development for general purposes. Such protection can only be
                                       accommodated in suburban extensions to be provided north and south as
                                       illustrated in the original premiated plan.

            <p><a name="d0e6148"></a>However, experiment with winds of the ordinary winter velocity on the
                                       Australian plateau indicates that a moderate amount of easily effected tree
                                       growth will afford sufficient protection for situations such as even the
                                       most exposed on this site, a fact further attested by the generally
                                       acknowledged attractiveness for habitation of the tops of spurs extending
                                       west from Capitol Hill.

            <p><a name="d0e6151"></a>As an initial deterrent to occupation, the wind may be discounted by the
                                       present local experience, wherein temporary settlement has been created in
                                       an area &#8212; possibly the most wind-swept of all &#8212; with very slight or no tree
                                       protection. Here the first permanent residence has been located after ten

                                       commanding, however, the mountain view.

            <p><a name="d0e6168"></a>The importance of classifying the purposes of the city lies in the fact that
                                       only by proceeding from generals to particulars, from the more essential to
                                       the lesser essential, and from the ends desired to the means for obtaining
                                       them are natural relationships established.

                                       reside in and utilize its spaces constitute its reason for being. The
                                       various kinds of occupation have divers needs to be met as to area,
                                       position, and environment. Secondly, their accommodation requires a
                                       communication system &#8212; the social means of linking up these elements.

                                       control, the character of fixed occupancy divides primarily into two
                                       branches &#8212; public and private. In the Capital City the former takes
                                       precedence, and is treated in a very broad way, because extension of
                                       functions may easily go beyond any present basis of expectation. Simplest
                                       possible arrangement on the most general lines of classification are adopted
                                       at the start to ensure both room for expansion and a constant coherence.

            <p><a name="d0e6208"></a>Because of unity of control all Federal improvements can be made to
                                       contribute to a single dominating group, and since these buildings and
                                       spaces can be assorted into four distinct classes, Governmental,
                                       Recreational, Educational, and Military, these four are established to form
                                       the structural bounds and terminals of two co-ordinate axes.

            <p><a name="d0e6211"></a>The unmistakable pre-eminence of Ainslie and Black Mountains ordained them
                                       for apposition with such axes, to which the site contributed further
                                       opportunity in the general direction of the Waterway, extending towards
                                       Black Mountain at right angles to a line joining Ainslie with the most
                                       prominent spur of the opposite range, "Kurrajong," and with a lesser
                                       eminence between, "Canberra Hill," directly at its front.

            <p><a name="d0e6214"></a>The co-ordinate axes disposed accordingly are not with the cardinal points of
                                       the compass, which would entail 25 per cent. building frontage without
                                       beneficial sunlight, nor with the diagonal points where, for part of the
                                       day, no shade could be found; but they lie midway between these extremes.

                                       frontage for all the important structures, and can be developed, as in the
                                       case of the Mall at Washington, with scope for artistic expression, little
                                       hampered by utilitarian limitations, affording the greatest ease and comfort

                                       accessible but still quiet area. On the basis of the two lines hereinafter
                                       designated "Water Axis" and "Land Axis," it is a simple matter to allot to

                                       suitable for building purposes, "Kurrajong," and to locate the Parliament

                                       for popular reception and ceremonial, or for housing archives and
                                       commemorating Australian achievements rather than for deliberation or
                                       counsel; at any rate representing the sentimental and spiritual head, if not
                                       the actual working mechanism of the Government of the Federation.
                                       "Kurrajong" is deemed too large and too high for a convenient working
                                       organization of Parliament, but, being the only conspicuous internal
                                       eminence that has a skyline visible from practically every portion of the
                                       city, it lends itself to an architectural treatment that need comprise
                                       little more than in the necessary ramps, stairs, and terraces for outlook to
                                       make it, by its natural bulk, the dominating architectural feature.

                                       two "Houses" is an incident in addition to the topographical situation that
                                       precludes making of that structure a focal feature.

                                       sufficient foreground from the former to set off the Parliament House on the
                                       latter, over which, however, the court of the Departmental Buildings on the
                                       next terrace below may yet be seen, while the view beyond is uninterrupted
                                       across the Basin, and the water front of the Public Gardens and along a
                                       broad plaisance to Ainslie. Parliament Building, on the edge of Canberra
                                       Hill, has an elevation of 50 feet above the succeeding plateau, and is
                                       approached therefrom by wide ramps around the fountain end of a terrace
                                       reservoir. From this terrace court of the reservoir the Parliament edifice
                                       has thus a lofty setting, stopping the long axis of the reservoir, crowned
                                       by the lofty Capitol behind, and supported on the flanks by the lower
                                       Departmental Buildings.

                                           <a name="135"></a> [Note: appertain?] to the people directly as distinguished from
                                       their representatives or agents or servants. It is, therefore, to be
                                       situated rather directly in communication with the congregation centres, and
                                       tributary to the homes of the people, than connected with any other Federal

                                       belong to this group, and are adapted, by their continuous boulevarded
                                       embankments, for a continuous motor route, and for water sports, pageants,
                                       and bathing, the central Basin incidentally forming a rowing-course of 1

                                       the land axis. The Theatre and Opera House, on either side, are reached from
                                       the municipal avenue on one hand, and from the boulevard of the water front
                                       garden on the other, for maximum accessibility from the residential
                                       districts. Farther to each side of the land axis are paired Galleries of the
                                       graphic and plastic arts; the Museums for natural history and archeology;
                                       the Zoological Gardens and the Baths, and Gymnasia; all together affording

                                       by establishing a subordinate axis adjoining the Recreation Group, which is

                                       tend to congestion to concentrate such conflicting though equally important
                                       general functions in one centre. Two centres, therefore, are fixed as the

                                       circular pools. The essentially city functions are not only tributary to all
                                       the inhabitants, as is the Recreation Group, but are to serve handily the

                                       occupancy; with the needs of circulation for business and of distribution
                                       only for access to retired districts, from the stand-point of communication,

                                       considerations, each line commands a view of terminal objectives, either
                                       natural or artificial, and each system of co-ordinates offers rectangular
                                       sites for all buildings up to a point of junction with the next similar
                                       system, while even at these intersections no acute angles are permitted, for
                                       triangular buildings are as expensive as they are irredeemably ugly. But the
                                       allowed obtuse intersections afford a quadrilateral site disposition, as
                                       economical as the rectangular type, with two long prospects at each sweep of

                                       improvements. Five of these suburbs were indicated in the first premiated
                                       competitive plan, one to be devoted to society congregation, three to
                                       agricultural pursuits, and one to manufacturing.

                                       order to effect a saving, at the outset, of the long weir bridge, it is
                                       considered that possibly the local branch from Queanbeyan, serving as a
                                       constructional line during the creative period, may be so plotted as to
                                       serve ultimately as a rapid transit adjunct to the main railroad route,
                                       linking in the Government centre with the northern and southern suburbs.
                                       This, however, can only be suitably accomplished by a line that can be
                                       concealed in the steeper slope of the hills approaching the Capital,
                                       crossing the river in a specially designed bridge with the track level
                                       beneath the roadway, with still enough room below the latter to clear the
                                       boulevarded river embankment. This branch, necessarily largely in tunnels,
                                       and with its limited ultimate functions permitting of relatively sharp
                                       curvature, affords access to Parliament House and the Industrial Centre of
                                       the initial City so close as to obviate any need for street vehicles to eke
                                       out the journey. Perhaps such additional rapid transit facility with a clear
                                       way, independent of the street traffic, might ultimately play part in the
                                       healthful dissemination of the Capital settlement.

                                       2 1/2 per cent., without excavation unduly expensive in proportion to the
                                       advantage sought. The desirability of straightness can hardly be
                                       over-estimated, but with it no convex profile is permissible. Whereas,
                                       however, these long lines are but few in the aggregate, because of the
                                       concentration of the circulative function, the value of their proper uniform
                                       grade and alignment for safety of operation, directness, and view of their
                                       important and attractive objectives, in the organic city, constitute an
                                       operative economy at least comparable with the demands of ordinary railroad
                                       lines, having infinitely less traffic burden, and infinitely greater
                                       distances and difficulties.

            <p><a name="d0e6625"></a>The basic circulation system comprises the triangle connecting simultaneously
                                       the three business centres of Government activity (Government, University,
                                       Military) and the two urban centres of local business (Administration and
                                       Merchandising). On this framework the City can develop all its functions
                                       from the beginning of its maturity with ample latitude for variation in each
                                       phase of activity, maintaining the final scale of a Capital City from the
                                       outset. Increments of gradual growth may be definitely, little by little,
                                       incorporated without confusion, congestion, or scattering along later
                                       extensions of the arterial systems, followed by corresponding distribution
                                       tributaries as required.

            <p><a name="d0e6628"></a>Never less than triple roadways can be considered sufficient to handle avenue
                                       traffic ultimately, with tramways, fast and slow vehicles in both
                                       directions; but, in the early projection of these avenues, it will be well
                                       to substitute park treatment or even to permit temporary private garden
                                       occupancy of the portions not immediately needed for traffic.

            <p><a name="d0e6631"></a>The street area, if reduced to three roadways, is a desert, dangerous and
                                       unpleasant to traverse, so in a sunny country of stately open-branched
                                       broad-leaf evergreen avenue trees, additional space is required for a final
                                       arboreal accompaniment of at least quadruple rows and supplemental shrubbery
                                       parkways for shade and shelter, wind and dust arresting. From considerations
                                       also of architectural setting, ventilation, fire stop, command of crossings,
                                       and eventual rapid transit, a uniform width of 200 feet is adopted.

            <p><a name="d0e6637"></a>A system of distribution at right angles to the circulation thoroughfares
                                       gives minimum of distance from either side of such thoroughfare. For access
                                       to public transfer lines, trams, &amp;c., this is the prime object. With
                                       a frequency of the circulation ways the distances are short; indeed, a point
                                       five blocks back in the triangular interspaces of this plan is a rarity.

            <p><a name="d0e6640"></a>The rectangular form of block most generally adapted to improvements, and
                                       straight roadways most simply kept and patrolled, can, in these purely
                                       distribution routes, be readily maintained with very slight modification for
                                       a considerable undulation in site since these streets essentially short in
                                       any one direction permit obstructions to remain or to be compassed by
                                       diverting ramps without loss of utility, while general and frequent
                                       variations in rate of slope can be accomplished at angles without rendering
                                       the irregularity apparent or disagreeable.

                                       distributing streets demands a contrasting dignity and severity in the
                                       connecting avenues that form the backbone of the system, and for that
                                       dignity the economy of the former easily contributes the requisite funds.

                                       accessibility, and in importance in direct ratio with their distances from
                                       their main axial artery, approach by degrees an ultimate of enclosed courts
                                       best adapted for privacy and quiet, tending naturally to maintain themselves
                                       for residential and similar purposes against any possible intrusion of
                                       business, especially since they are only reached from the main travel routes
                                       by ring cross streets that neither connect important points nor ever run
                                       directly in any one way for sufficient distance to attract active traffic.
                                       There are, however, no "dead ends" nor "cul de sac" streets expensive to
                                       serve.

                                       for use as well as to economy in service equipment pipes and wire lines,
                                       pavements, and their maintenance.

                                       omitted, leaving blocks 1,200 feet long, may be cited as having been able to
                                       perfect its street improvements, many years ahead of other places of similar
                                       conditions otherwise, but with the greater multiplicity of streets.

            <p><a name="d0e6660"></a>In the hilly sections the distribution lines take the form of sweeping ramps,
                                       confined, as far as possible, to the depressions for reasons heretofore
                                       explained, as well as for economy in the grading pipe service, drainage,
                                       shelter, and in the utilization of land that is of minimum value for other
                                       purposes. This way is also the simplest and least conspicuous in mutilation
                                       of natural rugged types of scenery. Effort has been directed towards
                                       securing arcs of the minimum curvature needed to compensate an appearance of
                                       varying and convex grades for economy as compared with straight lines in
                                       such locations, and for directness, safety, and ease of control as compared
                                       with short curves.

            <p><a name="d0e6663"></a>A uniform width of 100 feet for distribution ways is established as a
                                       suitable minimum interval between building fronts for light, air, privacy,
                                       and fore-garden embellishment. It is by no means a determinant of the
                                       desirable thoroughfare space in roadway, walk, or public parking, which
                                       should be graduated to a minimum requirement of possibly a 12-foot driveway
                                       alone in the farthest backset, short streets, or ravine climbs. There is no
                                       reason why the balance of the potential right of way should not be granted
                                       for fullest use to the private occupants and considered in all but reserved
                                       jurisdiction as belonging to individual abutting allotments, withholding an
                                       easement for direct service lines adjacent to the buildings, and retaining
                                       the exercise of considerable public control as to appearances. This is not
                                       an uncommon arrangement and one here allowing variable increase in the
                                       proportion of private sites to actual public ways directly corresponding to
                                       lesser unit values of the areas for fixed occupancy and their lesser demand
                                       for access.

                                       arrangement of all our activities. To illustrate, I append an attempted
                                       gradation from generals to particulars as suggested for a National
                                       University at the Capital. Some such system, taking no account of relative
                                       proportions and little of physical disposition, must be our sole guide prior
                                       to the definite determination of the physical possibilities and limitations
                                       of any University and should not be lost sight of amidst all the confusing
                                       details and modifications that must be continually admitted. Otherwise
                                       unity, elasticity and undiminished convenience, which are the very ends
                                       aimed at, will be jeopardized.

                                       be eminently adapted by its large light rooms to the general lecture and
                                       drafting work which constitute the basis of much of the Engineering
                                       students' activities, and may well house entirely a School of Architecture.

                                       facing, at least, for the later buildings, but the effort to establish more
                                       or less segregated courts is a means to reduce the incongruity of varied
                                       materials. At any rate, the eastern extensions can be carried out through

                                       development, should be carried out as stated, primarily in brickwork and

                                       approximate more closely to the original type of University design. Even if
                                       brickwork must be admitted generally, still it is possible that a very
                                       simple treatment, on the order of St. Paul's College, for instance, would
                                       make practicable the continuance of the stone facing for at least the inner

            <p><a name="d0e7229"></a>In Mr. Wilder's development we have one block of practically level land in
                                       one of the western suburbs of Chicago not so close to the city as to make it
                                       advisable to make lots smaller than 100 feet by 150 feet keeping it a high
                                       class residential group. The property is the size of two ordinary blocks of
                                       the town, one street coming to a dead end at the property. The four
                                       surrounding streets are the usual residential roadways. With the customary
                                       alley omitted we get an interior park 300 feet wide and 1200 feet long under
                                       the control of the citizenry of the residences surrounding it, 26 families,
                                       its equipment - tennis courts, ball fields, wading pools with their sand
                                       beaches and so on.

            <p><a name="d0e7232"></a>Maximum garden feeling is attained by arranging the houses in pairs or
                                       staggering them to make effective ensembles. The interior park is more or
                                       less screened by borderline plantings.

            <p><a name="d0e7255"></a>By eliminating the last block of a stub end street and the alleys, this
                                       interior park with all its advantages became possible supplemented by the
                                       outlooks gained by staggering the buildings.

            <p><a name="d0e7258"></a>In a small town the shorter block which was a stub-end street is eliminated,
                                       doing away with one thoroughfare. The subdivision is in larger lots
                                       appropriate to the less crowded district in an outlying town.

                                           "without use of instruments" has been crossed out.] that there was
                                       an error in the location of the trigonometric bases which affected the main
                                       land axis of his plan and consequently made the location of the corner stone
                                       laid at the dedication incorrect. The location of this monument off the axis
                                       did not bother him as he preferred a double monument, one on each side of
                                       the axis, as a town planning feature and plenty of occasions would offer for
                                       a second monument. But it was important that the surveys on which the plan
                                       was based and on which all working drawings would be made should be correct
                                       so he called the attention of the chief surveyor, Mr. <a name="143"></a> [Note: Charles]
                                       Scrivener, to this error.

            <p><a name="d0e7292"></a>Griffin was appointed as Director of Design and Construction of the Federal
                                       Capital in 1913 and took over his duties in May 1914.

            <p><a name="d0e7295"></a>Before leaving for his 6 months absence he requested the Minister <a name="144"></a> [Note: of
                                           Home Affairs?] that surveys should be made of the outer districts
                                       encircling the Capital so that the avenues of the city might be made
                                       properly to connect with their extensions into and across the rural
                                       districts. On his return he asked for these surveys which he found out
                                       unofficially had been completed, but it was months before he got them. The
                                       Minister's repeated requests and instructions for immediate delivery of the
                                       surveys were of no avail so that actual working drawings, street locations
                                       and grading could not be done at this time.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7301"></a>After working for some time on working drawings he became convinced by
                                       comparing various surveys that there was something wrong and on
                                       investigation found that the datum co-ordinates on the two sets of surveys
                                       were different though there was no indication of this on the lithographs.
                                       This meant great loss of time, entire revision of drawings and calculations.
                                       In spite of such handicaps however the work of making drawings at a scale of
                                       200 feet to the inch was continuing in Griffin's office.

                                       thrown out of office as the Party which awarded him the prize had previously
                                       been thrown out) was the demand for a complete working plan at 400 feet to
                                       the inch, a scale neither sufficiently small to work on as a whole nor

                                       got the barest glimpses, only such as suited official purposes and of which
                                       Parliament knew practically nothing until Griffin succeeding in getting the
                                       correspondence laid on the table shortly before the end of Mr. Archibald's
                                       Ministry; and much of which was unknown even to Griffin since he knew
                                       nothing of the officer's letters and reports to the Minister except as he
                                       could surmise it by the course of events. The officers refused to recognize
                                       that the Griffin plan had been accepted by Parliament.

                                       documents omitted from the papers presented to Parliament by Mr. Archibald
                                       at the request of Mr. Kelley in 1915 (i.e., suppressed by the officials when
                                       Parliament demanded the documents). The Minister, Mr. Archibald, also stated
                                       during the interview in regard to a question raised by Mr. Griffin as to his
                                       duties, that he wished first to receive his plan as above mentioned, and
                                       after considering same he would than define Mr. Griffin's duties. (No
                                       misunderstanding the nature of this threat.)

            <p><a name="d0e7369"></a>In Digest No. 20, 1st March, 1915 Mr. Archibald said:- Further action awaits
                                       submission by Mr. Griffin of a plan on such a scale and with necessary
                                       information as will <u>enable the Minister to consider its
                                              adoption for the purpose of the layout</u>.<br> (This 17 months after
                                       Griffin's appointment.)

            <p><a name="d0e7377"></a>Griffin made the following protest on the whole question on 11 May, 1915:- In
                                       justice to yourself and myself I would ask that the House, before proceeding
                                       to consider the issues in relation to the Federal Capital, be made cognizant
                                       of the entire inaccuracy of the statements which have been put into
                                       circulation to the detriment of the interests of the Commonwealth, myself
                                       and my staff.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7380"></a>Endless months were thus spent in writing and following up every clue from
                                       Press comments or the official parliamentary Gazette and endless chasing of
                                       this man and that. Well I remember the final race that I took with Mr.
                                       Griffin (so that I might help out as errand boy if required) to place the
                                       documents he had gathered together before the Prime Minister, Mr.
                                           <a name="148"></a> [Note: Joseph] Cook. Way out in the far distance we went for the
                                       surrounding municipalities of Sydney are all one-story buildings and so on
                                       the level, so Sydney stretches on endlessly the most desolate of all forms
                                       of desert, no vestige of beauty anywhere not even street plantings. And
                                       frantically back to the city to catch the train

            <p><a name="d0e7391"></a>for Melbourne, to place these documents, after Mr. Cook's approval, in the
                                       hands of his assistant Minister, Dr. Kelly, who was ready to demand of
                                       Parliament that it place the whole correspondence and documents in
                                       connection with the Federal Capital on the table, a proceeding which brings
                                       it out of the secret places and makes it available. He caught the train. In
                                       the course of the years he became renowned among the railroad people for
                                       these last second arrivals for he was perpetually taking this trip between
                                       Sydney and Melbourne. It was the one place where he could catch the
                                       Ministers.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7394"></a>I remember one time when he had disappeared beyond the ken of either of his
                                       offices, private or Federal, when we knew the importance of his catching the
                                       train for Sydney. I had packed his suitcase; one draftsman was sent to the
                                       station with it; one was placed at the foot of the elevator and another on
                                       the street corner to forestall his losing a moment by getting off the tram
                                       or coming up the lift. When he arrived at the last moment at the station,
                                       grabbing his suitcase himself and catching the train because of our
                                       precautions, the porter turned to the draftsman with disgust saying, "I
                                       never would have waited if I had known it was that guy." Mr. Griffin always
                                       preferred to carry his burdens himself.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7397"></a>The next day the papers were tabled. This made history. It led the Labor
                                       Party to replace Mr. Archibald by Mr. O'Malley in the Home Affairs Ministry,
                                       who with Mr. <a name="149"></a> [Note: William] Webster of the Post Office Department
                                       later brought off the Royal Commission.

            <p><a name="d0e7403"></a>One of the fights during this period was on the case of building an arsenal.
                                       It was a clever scheme to destroy the Capital City sooner or later by
                                       locating the arsenal within the boundaries of Canberra. Washington had had
                                       the experience of such a catastrophe early in its history. Griffin had
                                       opposed this in every way he could think of, accumulating data and informing
                                       members of Parliament and writing arguments for them against such procedure,
                                       but finally the definite instruction had come from Archibald to lay out
                                       plans for the location

            <p><a name="d0e7411"></a>and construction of buildings and industrial housing for this work. There
                                       could be no answer to such a precise instruction except acquiescence or
                                       resignation. That night looked dark indeed. I can't remember now whether we
                                       went to a moving picture show or just kept on with the drive of office work
                                       but we arrived home about midnight to find a note pinned on our pillow, for
                                       one of the Cabinet Ministers was lodging in the same residence. The
                                       documents laid on the table had worked. The standing of the whole Labor
                                       Party then in power was jeopardized by the character of the facts revealed
                                       in them, and they had called a meeting, and by election by the party members
                                       had shuffled a couple of the Ministers, one of them Mr. Archibald, and
                                       replaced him by Mr. O'Malley now again in the Home Affairs Ministry.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7414"></a>It was a new lease of life. Two of the Ministers were sympathetic with the
                                       movement, really important to the Labor Party (important to the people of
                                       Australia) of establishing a Federal Capital. It was they who had called for
                                       an international competition.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7417"></a>But the fight continued. Griffin would never have lived through these years
                                       of fight with the Civil Service if it hadn't been for the advice and
                                       assistance of Mr. James Alexander Smith, an engineer of world renown.
                                       Griffin soon learned to put none of his letters through until he had taken
                                       them to Mr. Smith for advice. Griffin was a very able thinker and letter
                                       writer but he put things from a rational point of view and reason is no
                                       element of bureaucracy. Mr. Smith from his experience within officialdom and
                                       from without, for he had refused to continue in the Service, would tell
                                       Griffin to leave the letter overnight and the next morning would frequently
                                       give him a totally different letter for he was able to see just how the
                                       officials would answer the points brought up. He always put the letter in
                                       such a form as to forestall the possibility of their putting forth such
                                       answers. The combination of Griffin's town planning knowledge and Smith's
                                       scientific knowledge and diplomacy prevented disaster.

                                       Royal Commission was demanded by two Ministers of the Crown, the Minister of
                                       Home Affairs permitting the Minister of the Post Office to call for a Royal
                                       Commission on the Home Affairs Department, and nine solid months of evidence
                                       piled up such a case against the officials that Griffin was able to work
                                       effectively in the development of Canberra for three years at the end of
                                       which time the plan was Gazetted which meant there could be no deviation

            <p><a name="d0e7445"></a>In Royal Commissions we find a most curious state of affairs. The Government
                                       is helpless before the Judiciary and this in the affairs that are supposed
                                       to be of most vital concern to the community. There is no court or judge
                                       before whom they can take their cases so they have to go from pillar to post
                                       asking this judge and that if they will be so kind as to take on this case.
                                       Frequently every one of the supreme judges will refuse to take on a Royal
                                       Commission. Then sometimes no State judge will act. Then the Government goes
                                       hunting about for a barrister who will be willing to act. Naturally in a
                                       case that looks bad for the officials it will be extremely difficult to find
                                       anyone willing to take it on as, if a judgment against the officials is
                                       rendered, it means the end of that judge's career and if the truth is plain
                                       to the public it may be very trying to have to render a judgment in their
                                       favor.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7448"></a>The system is one which presupposes that one will not be inclined to accept
                                       the position unless it has been made worth his while by one side or the
                                       other. As a rule all the favors are in the hands of the bureaucrats. Again
                                       the system is one that promotes corruption.

                                       produced, whose visitors in years gone by have included nearly every
                                       outstanding man of science and engineering who has come to Australia.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7465"></a>When he left the Railways he went into private practice as a consultant and
                                       his fame gradually spread all over Australia and beyond. There is not an
                                       engineer in Melbourne today who does not speak of him with immense respect.

            <p><a name="d0e7468"></a>As a consulting engineer he was responsible for works of considerable
                                       magnitude in Victoria and beyond. Thirty years ago the Government appointed
                                       him engineer member of a committee of engineer, architect and surveyor, who
                                       selected W.B. Griffin's prize winning plan for the city of Canberra from a
                                       number of plans received from all over the world.

            <p><a name="d0e7471"></a>Early in the century he was president for four years or the Victorian
                                       Institute of Engineers. The last paper he read before the Institute revealed
                                       his celebrated plan for roofing over the Flinders Street railway yards.
                                       There are many in Melbourne who believe that his plan will one day be
                                       carried out.

                                       the borders of the nations or we shall be faced with wars which will
                                       continue with increasing ferocity so long as mechanical genius continues to

            <p><a name="d0e7606"></a>1st- What changes in community organization should be made in this the best
                                       form, the Congressional, found only in the United States?

            <p><a name="d0e7609"></a>This is urgent since there seems to be a subterranean influence working for
                                       the perpetuation of the worst of all forms of government since all kinds of
                                       tyranny can screen themselves behind it - the Parliamentary form, the froth
                                       of which comes up even in our American Universities. It took a war of
                                       Revolution for the United States to free itself from that form. It is dust
                                       in the eye to say that it was a King from which we were escaping. The
                                       writers of Our Constitution knew the evils of the Parliamentary System of
                                       their own experience. This is the most urgent question in the reconstruction
                                       of the world at the close of this war.

            <p><a name="d0e7612"></a>It is urgent also since now the Oriental peoples (whose numbers reach the
                                       billion mark) are quite equal to the Occidentals (who number but a few
                                       million) in intellectual, scientific and mechanical ability. The present war
                                       has thoroughly awakened them to the issue of EMPLOYMENT.

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7639"></a>1st- Only under the Congressional form do the people have the opportunity, if
                                       they choose to use it, of selecting their Executive. The electoral system
                                           <a name="152"></a> [Note: US Electoral College?], a hang-over from the past, should be
                                       ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in the reach of the
                                       masses of the people.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7645"></a>2nd- Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes can
                                       determine the Executive from the start or at any time after the election by
                                       throwing out the elected party whenever they want to which gives then a
                                       powerful influence over them even without overthrowing them. They vote as
                                       they are told to vote or out they go. And the whole complicated and
                                       expensive business of election has to be gone through again. No wonder the
                                       people are dejected. I know one man who was under 7 different ministers
                                       during the 7 years of his employment by the Government, partly through
                                       changes forced on the Cabinet, several through the throwing out of the whole
                                       majority party.

            <p><a name="d0e7648"></a>This means that after the war Americans should use every possible means to
                                       direct the reorganization of Europe toward the Congressional form, and the
                                       basic principle should be laid down as the maintenance of Equity. Nowhere
                                       but in America is this the intention of government.

            <p><a name="d0e7651"></a>The next step should be to eliminate the power of granting monopolies from
                                       the Political realm. Whatever is done in this realm should be by the
                                       Abilities Organ. The Political - the central organ - would have the task and
                                       the power of preventing inequity.

                                       could be attained in the Congressional form by an amendment giving the right
                                       of recall. This would not be advisable in the case of the President as his
                                       function is executive which requires

                                       Capacities could be highly developed and efficiency enormously increased and

                                       which is essentially a community affair since it is based on division of
                                       labor. It is now plain that economic problems cannot be solved as individual
                                       concerns. To meet the <u>bodily needs</u> is now a community
                                       affair and requires a Community organization. This can function wholesomely
                                       only if it is independent of the Political organ. Its laws are entirely
                                       different. Business cannot be run democratically. There can be no efficiency
                                       in business run by majority votes. Its law is MUTUALITY not Equity. An

                                       Economic Organ for mutual advantage is a sound principle in business
                                       dealings. It can start in a Nation. Where is the easiest place in the world
                                       to put that concept into practice? America should take the initiative.

            <p><a name="d0e8081"></a>My husband was born in the great Chemical Ether Realm of the Mississippi
                                       River valley. He was one of the group of creative thinkers which 20th
                                       century science would lead us to expect to arise from a region ruled by that
                                       Ether from which all new forms arise - the chemical ether. Warmth &amp;
                                       Light are centrifugal forces. Sound &amp; Magnetism are condensing
                                       forces.

            <p><a name="d0e8084"></a>I myself was well described by a friend of Mother's into whose charge I had
                                       been placed when a child for a bit of art instruction. A friend asked her if
                                       I were an artist. She said, "No but if she makes up her mind to be one she
                                       will be one." When I was born Venus followed the Sun. My destiny evidently
                                       was to prepare myself in all those fields of art which would make me a good
                                       slave to my husband in his creative work. Since the creative forces in a
                                       woman naturally turn to sacrifice it was my great joy to the end to fulfill
                                       this function as best I could. The general verdict seemed to be that I did
                                       it well. When, after Griffin's death in India, I returned to Australia and
                                       called on Mr. James Alexander Smith he said, "No one can replace Mr.
                                       Griffin," then after a pause, "unless it is you," and I replied, "No I could
                                       not replace him but I was a very useful slave to him in his work."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8087"></a>Griffin's appointment as Federal Director was for 3 years. Those years were a
                                       perpetual battle, one might say against an Empire. During those years it was
                                       continual warfare always with the subtle assistance of Mr. Smith, battling
                                       with the Works Committee and finally with the Royal Commission, the second
                                       one of the only two ever to condemn the officialdom.

            <p><a name="d0e8090"></a>During these years and the succeeding years Griffin carried on a successful
                                       private business with a group of loyal, capable and devoted young people.
                                       Life was never dull.

                                       other in history where the verdict was given against the officials. Mr.
                                       Anderson though a surveyor for many years in England is debarred from
                                       practicing his profession in this country till he has served a full time of
                                       apprenticeship for 3 years in some surveyor's office here in Australia! In
                                       such petty ways, lacking in reality, do they try to make themselves believe

                                       thought might amuse you. For fear you might not catch it I'll inform you
                                       that she is referring to me and the impromptu dinner I gave them.

                                       ago, and make the kindred spirit that lies like a forgotten germ in an old

                                       ambitious to gain either souls or hearts. Which will it be I wonder. Anyway
                                       I am the happier this day for knowing there are Lippincotts and Elghs in the

                                       piercingly up into the "Coal Sack" for a beyond? I see not what the soul in
                                       me yearns for there, but I have almost caught it in those Eyes. Life is too

                                           <a name="159"></a> [Note: daughter of MMG's sister, Georgine], Well I went over to
                                       Uncle Walter's Federal office after writing Mama Gene's letter and found him
                                       busy dictating. I suggested that it was fifteen minutes till train time. No!
                                       he said and pulled out his watch which had stopped. He still thought it was
                                       about two. You can see where we would have been if I had waited for him to
                                       come for me. We got our train and were met at the station by the Russels who
                                       took us up in their car to their house on the mount, a lovely place on the
                                       side of a gully, their yard going down a hundred feet to a running stream,
                                       and a fine view across to Melbourne whose lights we could see at night.

            <p><a name="d0e8141"></a>A three hour walk next morning, two little girls along, nine years old, and a
                                       long one the next morning climbing to the top of the mount, this time only
                                       grown ups, not nearly so much fun; and the third day all day in the auto,
                                       the little girls and three other guests. A very jolly day going through some
                                       of the old mining districts. I felt that I had got quite a glimpse of
                                       Australia.

            <p><a name="d0e8144"></a>I had great fun picking blackberries on the place and kept the family
                                       supplied, also raspberries and currants and great big delicious
                                       gooseberries, and lettuce and peas and onions from the garden. We had a very
                                       homey time and it was a great rest.

            <p><a name="d0e8147"></a>I have just been over to the station to meet Walter who was to come home from
                                       Canberra this noon but he didn't come gosh darn him. If he comes tomorrow
                                       he'll probably have to go back the very next day yet there are things he'll
                                       probably have to come back for. He is going up with the Minister of Home
                                       Affairs. That's the fourth change in Ministry he has had and we are
                                       wondering when the next change will happen. He sort of has to begin over at
                                       the beginning with each new Minister. However to each three steps backward
                                       we are still hoping there is one forward to the good. Only time will tell.
                                       Who cares. It's exceedingly funny at times, "But for God's sake don't
                                       smile," one friend tells us; "These people are British."

            <p><a name="d0e8155"></a>I don't suppose you remember that when you were a little tot your Mother used
                                       to tell you you couldn't cry, that crying wasn't allowed in flats, and you
                                       were quite obedient. But really that isn't half so bad as not being allowed
                                       to laugh. But even that isn't so bad as the fate of a little girl I passed
                                       on the street some time ago. She was sitting beside a beggar and I heard him
                                       tell her "Now cry," and she had to start crying so that people would give
                                       him money. A pretty hard way for that tiny girl to earn money for the grown
                                       ups wasn't it. Much love from Auntie.

            <p><a name="d0e8158"></a>1917 - January, 12. Dear Mother, I am taking things very easy at the office
                                       now, and not hurrying with the breakfast dishes to come down town with
                                       Walter, though his toilet takes so much longer than mine that it is not a
                                       serious task for me to get up and get breakfast and wash the dishes while he
                                       is getting ready to leave the house. And I am either taking a nap in the
                                       middle of the afternoon or leaving early and going home instead of waiting
                                       here at the office to dine at uncertain hours with Walter. He has to spend
                                       practically all his evenings as well as all day on his Federal work,
                                       frequently in consultations, instead of at his private office, so that my
                                       staying down gives me only a half hour with him as a rule to go over the
                                       private office work.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8161"></a>I am no longer trying to get an occasional lunch with him but am joining the
                                       family party in the office. We all of us get so sick of lunching out,
                                       especially in fly time, as no pains are taken at any of the restaurants to
                                       keep them out which makes the physical exercise of driving away the flies
                                       from your food too strenuous for restfulness to say nothing of the damaging
                                       effect it had on one's appetite. This sounds almost like a family quarrel
                                       with my husband, but it's just an interlude of rational living for one half
                                       the family, in spite of the fact that the other half of the family cannot
                                       indulge. (The completion of the Cafe Australia for Mr. Lucas started a
                                       revolution in community services of this kind as did the plumbing of Newman

                                           Woodrow Wilson's] speech to the Senate is magnificent. Our hope is
                                       that his motive is to be able to say to the European nations, "You see that
                                       we are ready to give up just as much as you would have to do in disarming,"
                                       as he could also say in internationalizing the Panama Canal along with the
                                       other canals of the world. Walter has been away all this week, the Royal
                                       Commission is still sitting on Canberra. We hope it is nearly over now.

                                       frantically libeling the Cafe Australia, thinking no doubt that if they make
                                       it disagreeable enough for each of our clients people will be afraid to
                                       employ us and since the whole population of this country is about that of a
                                       good sized city in the U.S. and everybody knows about everybody it is of
                                       course a fruitful field for gossip, but not being particularly cowardly
                                       ourselves we are not disturbing ourselves in the least about these things.
                                       They may know their public and then again they may not. Walter is just as
                                       peaceful and well and cheerful and energetic as ever and some very important
                                       things have been accomplished. We call him "Protected of Heaven" as he
                                       certainly seems to be in his bucking up against an Empire. I wish Mrs.
                                           <a name="162"></a> [Note: Mary?] Wilmarth would come over with you to visit us. I

                                       decorate her table with a great bunch of Amaryllis lilies such as we are
                                       getting here now. I had a surprise party on my birthday. Genevieve
                                           <a name="167"></a> [Note: Lippincott], when she was leaving Sunday evening said, "You
                                       and Walter come over to dinner with us Wednesday." I thought she was crazy
                                       to expect Walter but said I would get him to come if I could. Afterward it
                                       dawned on me that it would be the 14th, my birthday.

            <p><a name="d0e8215"></a>Well Walter managed it though he had to skip away right after dinner. It's a
                                       pleasant boarding house where they are and they arranged for a private room
                                       for the party so it was very jolly. Genevieve had been down to our flat the
                                       day before and had made a cake and had so removed all her traces that I
                                       didn't know she had been there and they had also made ice cream and candy.
                                       Tell Mrs. Raftis I did get her Christmas letter and nonsense book about us
                                       and we did have a good laugh and it did feel good. First I laughed by myself
                                       and afterward I laughed to see Walter laugh as he read it. I shall get
                                       around to writing to her as soon as I can.

                                       calling tonight and tomorrow, and the next night we are going to invite some
                                       people to the house. The great difficulty with that is that it is impossible
                                       to invite any two families at the same time. They are all either enemies or
                                       of different classes or something or other. Such a country. However our flat
                                       wouldn't hold many so that relieves the queer look of it a little.

            <p><a name="d0e8242"></a>We had no bowl and pitcher in our house so last week I decided I wouldn't put
                                       off any longer getting something a guest could wash in. Plumbing is unknown
                                       in Australia even in Sydney and Melbourne. We had made up our minds we
                                       simply would not have an ordinary bedroom set. They are so ugly. So I looked
                                       about and found something I thought would do - a large flat flower bowl and
                                       two water bottles to match. So I went up to the Federal Office and made
                                       Walter go over to see if it suited him. But he went me one better and we got
                                       a lovely bronze bowl and a big bronze flower vase for a slop jar and two
                                       blue china water bottles. It makes a very handsome set and really cost but
                                       very little more than the ordinary ugly things for which they charge three
                                       to five pounds for the very cheapest. Now we are going to get a couch cover
                                       for the bed in that room which will make it look quite pretty. Lovingly,
                                       Aunt.

                                       happy returns of the day. As I have been thinking back we must be just about
                                       the age of Mother when she was plugging for the principal's exam with Mrs.
                                       Young at which time a new career began for her and for Chicago schools under

                                       unbelievable to the Superintendents and her continued courses with her
                                       teachers, initiating what afterward became University Extension courses. She
                                       certainly has done a splendid life's work since then so after I get a good
                                       rest I am going to start to emulate her. There has been another change of

                                       Walt has been the chief cause of the overthrows. There is to be an election

                                       vegetarians when we dine chez nous. I can hardly say with propriety that I
                                       am delighted at the prospect of inheriting Alice's three little girls since
                                       that would entail the death of Alice and Clara, but I certainly would be
                                       delighted to have the girls. Love to my dear sister.

            <p><a name="d0e8265"></a>1917 - February, 26 - Mother Darling, Saturday Walter and I did have a
                                       sensation. He had promised the afternoon to me to go over the planting plans
                                       for the Newman College or perhaps even to take a walk through the Botanic
                                       Gardens, so I went for him at lunch time, waited around while he finished
                                       one thing and another. Then after lunch he said he must still see his
                                       Minister who was leaving for Adelaide that afternoon at four. We tried to
                                       get to his hotel but were blocked by a Win the War parade. Then we aimed for
                                       the station but did not know the route of the Parade and every turn we took
                                       we found ourselves blocked. Finally at twenty to four I said let's try
                                       breaking through which we succeeded in doing though a woman said "shame" to
                                       me at my irreverence. Well we made the train though breathless. Then as
                                       trams were crowded we walked home through the Botanic Gardens, always a
                                       treat, got and ate supper and scooted back to town for a movie and it was a
                                       sensation. How the Censor ever allowed it I don't see as it was a most
                                       powerful pacifist sermon though of course there's no telling whether the
                                       audience took it that way. It was "Intolerance," a magnificent spectacle
                                       which you certainly must see when it comes your way. It shows four episodes
                                       - Babylon - Jerusalem at the time of Christ - Massacre of St. Bartholomew -
                                       and Modern. Certainly no one could ever call ours

                                       show. Cyrus with his "Kill, kill, kill," and Catherine de Medici with her
                                       "We must destroy them or we will be destroyed," as shown in the play slapped
                                       you in the face after the spectacle in the afternoon with the enthusiasm of
                                       the crowds on the streets and lined up on Parliament House steps - the
                                       little wizened Minister of Defense and the big fat Minister of the Navy
                                       sitting there and clapping their hands over the sending off of all the young
                                       men of the community to "Kill, kill, kill." The picture went even so far as
                                       to show a bit of modern warfare. It doesn't seem possible that the point
                                       wasn't plain. But when one once gets the beam in his eye that it is virtuous
                                       to kill rather than be killed there doesn't seem to be any vision left to
                                       see anything. It is amazing to see how quickly the cloak of assumption of
                                       Christianity drops off and the real religion of the people shows itself
                                       which is hate your enemy and destroy anything or anybody if it is to your
                                       advantage to do so, and certainly destroy anything you are afraid of and be
                                       afraid of most everything.

                                       during these days of uncertainty. I think war, war, war morning noon and
                                       night and consequently I row all day long with the Australians on the
                                       subject, and have developed into such a termagant that I will be an outcast
                                       in my native land when I reach
            </p>

            <p><a name="d0e8287"></a>it. None of my erstwhile friends will have anything to do with me. I have had
                                       bitter and hostile words with Miss Elsie Simpson who has come out here from
                                       New York to be the Secretary of Professor Irvine of the Sydney University.
                                       She thinks (and so does Prof. Irvine) that in the sleekness of our
                                       prosperity we have lost our souls, in fact that the day will come "When the
                                       people will cry for Wilson's blood because he has not helped <u>England</u> spread the <u>doctrine of humanity</u>." She
                                       is sure that it is a sign of our degeneracy when a man like
                                       <a name="170"></a> [Note: Theodore] Roosevelt the mighty is not called upon to take the
                                       reins of government over this desperate period. She thinks England is
                                       fighting for Belgium and defends the shooting of the Irish rebels - an act
                                       that even the English government repudiated. She says frankly that the
                                       mothers of the "lower" classes on the whole do not mind giving up their sons
                                       and that they have children after the fashion of a cat having kittens.
                                       Unfortunately she seems to believe that I will wield some influence when I
                                       get home and has undertaken to convert me, pressing Prof. Irvine and Mr.
                                       Adams, editor of the Red Page of the Bulletin, into her service to help with
                                       my conversion. She pursues me with invitations which always end in insult,
                                       and finally the 100% Irish in me sloughed off its pretense to civilization
                                       and I let go. If she only wouldn't call herself an American. When she says
                                       she's an aristocrat I always think of your definition of "something that
                                       comes to the top." Aren't I awful?

                                       I'm studying the two books you recommended and am reading, reading, and
                                       trying to think - the latter with discouraging results. I am sending along

            <p><a name="d0e8326"></a>1917 - March 14, Dear Miss Murphy, Don't get discouraged. I met Miss Simpson
                                       myself. I couldn't talk to her because she was so hopelessly superficial but
                                       Prof. Irvine I have a respect for as he did stand up for the right - my side
                                       of course - in an issue I was fighting in Sydney with the Town Planning
                                       Association though our points of view were far apart in many things but it
                                       was at his house that several University professors in the very early days
                                       of the war insisted that physical prowess was the proof of the superiority
                                       of a people (in the course of condemning the U.S. for not coming in of
                                       course) and when I asked if they meant that if Germany won in the war that
                                       would prove the superiority of the German people they said "yes."

            <p><a name="d0e8329"></a>I must impress upon you that it is not undemocratic to object to seeing a
                                       lovely prospect defiled by a lot of chairs which stupid humans clutter a
                                       place up with. Democracy, the "highest ideal the human mind has ever climbed
                                       to" requires nothing ugly nor destructive nor mean. As to information about
                                       Australian flora, it is almost impossible to get it. I will send you a
                                       little book on Acacias which will confirm this statement of mine. There are
                                       botanical books of course but it is not possible to get much for landscape

            <p><a name="d0e8337"></a>them. Just as Mr. Griffin was one of the pioneers in the use of native plants
                                       in the U.S. which has since become so popular, so here he has had to gather
                                       most all of the data necessary for native planting himself. Ever since his
                                       arrival we have used every possible opportunity for learning the points of
                                       the wonderfully beautiful native flora, decorative, soil requirements,
                                       seasons of blooming, etc. I wish I had shown you the volume we have
                                       compiled, 8 inches by 16 inches by 4 inches thick. It has been some task but
                                       lots of fun. We have got mostly from direct observation assisted, when we
                                       first came over, by Miss Leplastrier in weekend walks, and other botanists
                                       from whose knowledge of plants Mr. Griffin's landscape questions piled up
                                       information that they would not include in their written works. Also from
                                       constant watching of the very fine Botanical gardens of Sydney and Melbourne
                                       through all seasons aided by such botanical reference books as those of
                                       Guilfoile and Miss Sulman who have written popular botanies, Cambage and
                                       others. I don't know whether I gave you a copy of a talk I gave in Sydney on
                                       Citizenship. One page of that takes up a hurried summary of the points of
                                       some of the lovely avenue trees and I'll write a bit on the decorative
                                       plantings for Canberra.

                                       universal among white folks outside of the States may help to keep them from
                                       falling into some of the pitfalls. I do love my folks even if I have no

                                       him not to renege on his principles that we have been so proud of, that
                                       slurs and insults have meant nothing to us any more than they would coming

                                       entering High School. Remember to take manual training even if you are the
                                       only girl in the class. I am glad you have had a chance to hear both your
                                       Uncle Jerome's point of view and mine. There are always two points of view -
                                       one right. It is of vital importance that one should familiarize oneself
                                       with both and take upon himself the responsibility of deciding which is
                                       right. I am sending you a pamphlet Roy's <a name="174"></a> [Note: Roy Lippincott's]
                                       mother sent him speaking of their "adventurous belief in the Christian
                                       principle of human brotherhood." Undertaking to live according to that
                                       principle is a great and thrilling adventure in which the Quakers have often
                                       proved, in the most surprising circumstances, its absolute efficiency.

            <p><a name="d0e8369"></a>Yesterday a birthday party. Roy <a name="175"></a> [Note: Lippincott] come home at about
                                       half past four and made the strawberry ice cream. One can't buy decent ice
                                       cream in Australia. Walter as usual came in the last minute after the guests
                                       had arrived and when all the work was done. He has enough good excuses for
                                       us to let him off the domestic work. When I have guests now I have my Mrs.
                                       McEwan come in to wash up the dishes. As there is only one entrance which
                                       opens right into the living room, we put a stool outside out bedroom window
                                       and she crawls in so that she reaches the kitchen without anyone knowing she
                                       is there. She is as pleasant and cute about this as in other ways wanting to
                                       make everything run as smoothly as possible. She is a pretty woman and her
                                       name is Kathleen, anyway she is all right. We call her our domestic engineer
                                       and in applying for jobs as a charwoman she tells folks that that is what
                                       her present employers call her. Good wishes on your graduation and birthday
                                       month. Aunt.

                                       back at the foot of the hills leaving the port itself to the flat strip of
                                       coast. You have to take a train from Adelaide to Port Adelaide. Its like Los
                                       Angeles and its sea port town. I had implored Walter not to attend this
                                       conference. We know the men who were running it and I hate to have him soil
                                       his skirts by having anything to do with them or lend their assemblies the
                                       dignity of his name. However he isn't so particular about the skirts of his
                                       coat and refuses to foresee evil intent. If anyone ever lived up to the
                                       principle of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil it is he.

                                       are trying to pass a law which will grant a huge monopoly, destroying all
                                       private or local enterprise in architecture or town-planning. Walter did
                                       what he could to stem the tide and get some semblance of democratic
                                       principle instilled into the resolutions or into the consciousness of the
                                       assembly but nobody in this community believes in those lines. People love
                                       to put their necks under a yoke. No argument was allowed. It was absurd to
                                       call it a conference. It was a Sunday school picnic with nice little
                                       kindergarten talks all arranged for the supposed experts to listen to. The
                                       only democratic suggestion that was made was by the Governor General whose
                                       speech closed the conference - the only one with a grain of sense in it.

                                       one's mouth to see things being put over the poor innocents. It's a city of

                                       shore, and the Harbor. The last day we ran away from the conference and took
                                       a long walk over the hills getting close to the wild flowers and getting
                                       photographs of some most exquisitely beautiful, superb trees. The courts of

                                       now drawing close to completion. It is sure a stately building. We are
                                       planting the shrubbery there too, ten acres of it, as the grading is now in

                                       with the pink hair as you used to call him) and I are staying at the
                                       Lippincotts for a few weeks now - until Genevieve gets a girl, and until the
                                       planting is done. We have all been digging to beat the band. I myself put in
                                       83 geranium slips one day, and Walter and George Elgh who was here over
                                       Sunday put in a lot of shrubs, etc., all Saturday and Sunday. Walt has
                                       started a seed bed which will keep us busy for a long time if all goes well.
                                       Roy spends his time mostly on a vegetable garden of which Walt is very
                                       scornful but which the rest of us thoroughly approve. We're putting in lemon
                                       and orange and grape fruit trees and almonds and passion fruit and logan
                                       berries. Fortunately things grow for Walt so we're likely to have <u>some</u> garden.

            <p><a name="d0e8473"></a>By now we are beginning to realize the importance, the necessity, of unified
                                       control of large areas of land. This is one of the major problems we shall
                                       have so solve if our civilization is to remain healthy. Nothing short of the
                                       correct threefold organization of our communities can meet this requirement.
                                       There was such control in the days of the hill cities of Italy which are
                                       such outstandingly beautiful things. But that type cannot satisfy people who
                                       have once tasted this so very modern dish called "equity." 
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8476"></a>Nor can the other extreme which enabled the Political Organization to collect
                                       the total unearned increment solve this problem since that would make the
                                       Nation the owner of the land and the land values would be spent either in
                                       building up a powerful military organ or in pauperizing certain groups by
                                       doling out these moneys to those who on small acreages cannot compete in the
                                       market with those who handle great areas by mechanization.

            <p><a name="d0e8479"></a>Only by adding two other organizations, one to effect Mutuality and one to
                                       effect Liberty, to the political whose only function is to effect Equity,
                                       can the management of our communities become so flexible as to be able to
                                       place large areas of land or large sums of money, unearned increment, in the
                                       hands of individuals of ability to give them control for designing and
                                       bringing about planned areas to meet the expanding needs of growing
                                       communities.

                                       often the weight thrown on the shoulders of individual owners has been too
                                       great for fruition, and splendid beginnings have come to naught or dragged
                                       at an impossibly slow pace. Only in Canberra has the goal been reached and

                                       feet, the land varying from approximately level to rolling hills. This calls
                                       for curved streets to take full advantage of simple construction of roads on
                                       easy grades and of the natural charm for the grouping of buildings. A church
                                       and a Community House are at the top of the hill strategically approached
                                       from the station.

                                       making traffic safe. On the whole straight roads are a crime on sloping

                                       of Home Affairs, obtained Parliamentary authority to refer the City Railway
                                       and Dams for Ornamental Waters to the Public Works Committee. This meant
                                       endless months on the witness stand for Griffin. His amazing knowledge of

                                       now served him well, for through all these years of quizzing by Officials
                                       and Experts they never caught him in an error though he made no pretense of
                                       infallibility nor of being expert in these various technical realms. What he
                                       asked for was to be allowed to employ certain experts to carry out the
                                       sewage system, etc. The system the officials put in later proved to be no
                                       good - a sewage farm method for which the soil was not proper.

                                       Affairs Department which was the one which had charge of the Federal
                                       Capital. The perfection of the ingenuity for deviltry of the whole British
                                       machinery is again evidenced in the fact that no High Court Judge is
                                       required to take on the function of judge in a Royal Commission. Since the
                                       Federal Capital had been going on for some two years now, everyone knew it
                                       would not be easy to give the officials a clean slate and only once in the
                                       history of the Empire had a Royal Commission condemned the Civil Service.
                                       Those in the game knew also that life would no longer be easy for anyone who
                                       put himself wrong with Officialdom so every one of the national Chief
                                       Justices refused to serve. Finally a barrister of Sydney <a name="188"></a> [Note: Wilfred
                                           Blacket] was persuaded to take on the task. We ourselves are
                                       inclined to think that his failure to achieve conspicuous success later was
                                       probably due to the antipathies he doubtless aroused in giving judgments
                                       against the officials.

                                       qualities tend to blind our eyes to the nefarious nature of the British
                                       system. As a child in England, he had worked in the mines harnessed to a
                                       cart and on his hands and knees in the low channels he had dragged out the
                                       coal carts. He came to Australia in his youth and forewarned his prospective
                                       bride that the time would come when it might be hard for her to adjust her
                                       life to his when he became a Minister of the Crown which was his intention.
                                       He had achieved that at just this critical time of Griffin's hitherto single

                                       Department, Griffin was able to get actual work done in the construction of
                                       the Capital City. For the first two years he had been up against a stone
                                       wall fighting, as he recognized, not individuals, but an institution.

                                       firsthand information of how Bureaucracy, established Bureaucracy, no matter
                                       how desirable it may seem in its early stages, really works. Great credit is
                                       due to this outstanding Britisher, Mr. Wilfred Blacket, for taking on this
                                       unwelcome and dangerous task. Upwards of 40,000 questions were put and
                                       answered and nearly 400 Exhibits, some very voluminous, were tendered in the
                                       evidence. The public, of course, got only such glimpses as were afforded by
                                       press quotations as evidence was given. The matter of the 400 foot plan was
                                       scarcely commented on. In fact I find no comments in the press except those
                                       officially inspired a year before the Commission began.

                                       to enable the effective work to be proceeded with at once. Possibly
                                       consideration of these items involving, of course, the features directly
                                       dependent thereon, may be helpful to you at this juncture; if so they are at

                                       1915<br> Dear Sir, Your communication of the 25th February is at hand
                                       pointing out that you intimated on 9th December last that you had available
                                       the levels of the Railway, Lakes and other features specially referred to in
                                       your design for the Federal Capital City. I cannot find any record in the
                                       correspondence of such an intimation, and so far as the notes made at the
                                       time and my recollection and that of the officers present are concerned you
                                       do not appear to have made such information clear at the interview I had
                                       with you on 9th December last.

                                       continually called for a 400 foot to the inch plan which would be
                                       unnecessary whereas the 200 feet to the inch plan was already prepared
                                       sufficiently for various works. In fact the premiated plan was on the scale
                                       of 400 feet to the inch so they already had it.)

            <p><a name="d0e8618"></a>Question number 230 - Walter Burley Griffin to Mr. <a name="190"></a> [Note: William]
                                       Webster - It was repeatedly urged that the Minister was waiting for levels
                                       from me. The statement was made in Parliament and in the press in such a way
                                       as to create the impression that I was delinquent. My friends and people on
                                       the street were asking me, "Why do you not meet the requirements of your
                                       Minister?" All the time I was pressing on with the work as fast as I could.
                                       The information which I was asked to supply involved a great deal more work
                                       than the Minister evidently realized, despite my repeated explanations as to
                                       the amount of work involved. If I had had a clear course this work would not
                                       have been interpolated <a name="191"></a> [Note: interpellated?] at that time. It was
                                       unnecessary work and involved unnecessary delay. It was not my fault that
                                       delay occurred. I asked for assistance for this work and it was authorized
                                       in November.... That is the only time when assistance was readily given
                                       (i.e., when it was on unnecessary work). It was specifically granted for the
                                       purpose of developing the plan which I said was not necessary. The effect of
                                       this assistance was only to perform a work which would have the result of
                                       delaying my work.

                                       all the drawings. That would be a matter for an engineer, not for me. Did
                                       you think that I was going through all the drawings?

                                       embraced all the works - works which could not be determined without the
                                       necessary investigations which would occupy a considerable time.

            <p><a name="d0e8647"></a>Griffin - You finally limited your request to work which I could supply to
                                       you within three or four months.

                                       described as a bluff the other day I replied on the 19th December and asked
                                       for some levels of the major works - bridges, main avenues, railways, lakes,
                                       etc. Was I doing you an injustice when I said that you were anxious to give
                                       me information but in homeopathic doses?

            <p><a name="d0e8653"></a> Griffin - I do not like the term "homeopathic doses." I said that I could
                                       prepare the works individually for presentation to you but I could not
                                       prepare a plan showing the whole of them.

            <p><a name="d0e8656"></a>1205 - By the Commissioner <a name="193"></a> [Note: Blacket] - The question is whether you
                                       withheld the full information you possessed and gave only inconsiderable
                                       parts of it?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8662"></a>Griffin - I say emphatically that I did not withhold information. I was
                                       giving it as fast as it could be prepared. I was anxious to do so in order
                                       to facilitate the work. What I objected to was having to hold back the work
                                       pending the receipt of all these things which would take an unreasonable
                                       amount of time and occasion considerable expense and preliminary
                                       investigation.

                                       offered my services at any time and offered to expedite any portion of the
                                       work which you wished to have expedited and you did not avail yourself of my
                                       offer.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8691"></a>1230 - Archibald - Would you be surprised to learn that it was the industrial
                                       situation which confronted the Government and myself that led me to ask you
                                       for this plan?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8694"></a>Griffin - I did realize the situation and I strongly urged upon you that
                                       works in the City should be developed without any delay.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8697"></a>1232 - Archibald - Do you seriously contend that they could have been gone on
                                       with unless the Government had a plan of them.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8700"></a>Griffin - I knew, as a matter of fact, that the Government had a plan of the
                                       city and what I was endeavoring to do was to prepare plans of works as
                                       rapidly as possible with the object of having them put in hand.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8703"></a>1232 - Archibald - You have already admitted that the Government had no plan
                                       with the levels, although the situation I have described was confronting
                                       them at that time?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8706"></a>Griffin - You finally resolved your requests to me into a plan for levels
                                       generally extended over the city which I expedited to the utmost. I had to
                                       point out at the same time that that was not necessary to the putting in
                                       hand of works. The Government had a plan of the Capital before them and
                                       plans of any or all of the works that they desired should be gone on with,
                                       could be prepared for them. Any particular work could be investigated and
                                       worked out without delay but to hold up particular works, pending the
                                       completion of the designs of all and the determination of structural levels
                                       throughout, would seriously delay the progress of the Capital.

            <p><a name="d0e8709"></a>1234 - Archibald - Do you think I wanted the plan I asked for for any but the
                                       practical purpose of pushing on with the city?
            </p>

            <p><a name="d0e8720"></a>I believe, to me; but I tried to point out that, in my opinion, that was not
                                       the most practical way in which to push on with the city.

                                       indicate the reason why I wanted it and had wanted it for months?

            <p><a name="d0e8726"></a>Griffin - I understood that when you got the plan of levels you were going to
                                       put the works in hand. As a matter of fact you did not put the works in
                                       hand.

                                       Thomas] Owen about the lakes did not that convey to your mind that I
                                       was anxious to get on?

            <p><a name="d0e8735"></a>Griffin - It seemed to me that it was raising issues and questions tending to
                                       discourage the assumption of works.
            </p>

                                       responsible to the Cabinet and the country, I had to explain to Parliament
                                       what the lakes were?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8741"></a>Griffin - Yes and I was pressing upon you all the time for an opportunity to
                                       explain the works to you.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8744"></a>1238 - Archibald - When I received the report from Colonel Owen about the

                                       asked in order to get on with the work?

            <p><a name="d0e8747"></a>Griffin - It did not impress me that that would be the result of the
                                       procedure.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8750"></a>1239 - Archibald - I am under the impression that I instructed that action
                                       should be taken within a week after I got the plan because as a layman I did
                                       not think that there would be enough water to fill the lakes?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8753"></a>Griffin - I am surprised that you as a layman concluded that there was not
                                       enough water to fill the lakes.

                                       one of these highly specialized matters that require a great deal of
                                       experience before an opinion can be given. But may I suggest that while you
                                       were asking me for this plan of the levels, that on the 9th December I gave
                                       you the levels of the lakes, and I should have thought that you might have
                                       been utilizing that period to make the investigations if you wanted to get
                                       on with the work.

            <p><a name="d0e8779"></a>1247 - Archibald - Where was there any lack of courtesy on my part in
                                       submitting these proposals to the Public Works Committee.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8782"></a>Griffin - The plans submitted to the Public Works Committee <u>were not of my design</u> and you had not consulted me about then at
                                       all or given me an opportunity to explain the features of my design.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8788"></a>1248 - Archibald - Do you not think that if I had consulted you it would have
                                       led to further delay?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8791"></a>Griffin - No, I think it would have facilitated the work very such. Had you
                                       consulted me we might have had a definite proposal to make to the Public
                                       Works Committee and as part of my plan it could have been gone on with.

            <p><a name="d0e8794"></a>1249 - Archibald - Did it not strike you that in referring this matter to the
                                       Public Works Committee you would have had an opportunity of submitting your
                                       plan?

            <p><a name="d0e8797"></a>Griffin - Certainly but it would have taken over a year to discuss the
                                       various questions connected with the matter before the works Committee.

                                       and they are not through with it yet. They have not yet taken the whole of

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8815"></a>Griffin - Certainly I do think so. The determining of these matters before
                                       they went to the Public Works Committee would, by defining the scope of the
                                       inquiry, have given that body a definite understanding as to what they were
                                       to report upon.

            <p><a name="d0e8826"></a>Griffin - I never questioned whether you were acting within your rights or
                                       not in asking for the level plans. I supplied the information.

            <p><a name="d0e8829"></a>1254 - Archibald - Do you not think that a Government should be careful not
                                       to create more circumlocution?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8832"></a>Griffin - Yes decidedly. In Government work there is a general tendency to
                                       circumlocution.

            <p><a name="d0e8835"></a>1255 - Archibald - Was it not desirable that, in order not to duplicate
                                       reports, I should get them from the departmental engineers direct and
                                       without coming through your office?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8838"></a>Griffin - The result had been that reports prepared without my advice have
                                       all had to be recast when my advice has been given. If the officers had
                                       obtained their information from me it would have been correct as to the
                                       requirements of the city plan.

            <p><a name="d0e8841"></a>1256 - Archibald - Do you contend that Cabinet and Parliament have no right

                                       it but from larger plans, and his instructions would have been issued from
                                       those larger scale plans. I have some recollection of his mentioning in that
                                       interview with Mr. Archibald that they thought a portion of the city should
                                       be developed from a 200 feet to the inch plan at the time. My recollection
                                       is that he stated he had some plan of 200 feet to the inch ready to proceed
                                       with.

            <p><a name="d0e8903"></a>21984 - Webster - What you said then was correct?

            <p><a name="d0e8906"></a>Hill - It is not correct there. I have some recollection of his mentioning in
                                       that interview that he had plans 200 feet to the inch to go on with.

            <p><a name="d0e8912"></a>Hill - On p. 48 (Exhibit "A1") it is stated that Mr. Griffin said that he was
                                       proceeding with the planning on the lines of the levels and sections.

            <p><a name="d0e8915"></a>21988 - Webster - Do you remember that he said he had worked out a 200 feet

            <p><a name="d0e8918"></a>Hill - I remember just a remark that he had some of it at 200 feet to the

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8921"></a>21991 - Webster - Did Mr. Griffin mention that he had a plan of 800
                                           <a name="199"></a> [Note: sic, possibly 400?] feet to the inch?

            <p><a name="d0e8927"></a>Hill - I have some recollection of some plan but whether it was 800
                                           <a name="200"></a> [Note: sic, possibly 400?] feet to the inch exactly or not I would
                                       not definitely say.

            <p><a name="d0e8933"></a>21992 - Webster - Was that put in your report?

            <p><a name="d0e8936"></a>Hill - It is so mentioned in my report, and I am prepared to say to the best
                                       of my recollection that that plan was not mentioned on that definite scale
                                       number at that interview.

            <p><a name="d0e8939"></a>22002 - Webster - Did you hear the Minister indicate that he wanted those

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8942"></a>Hill - I heard the Minister say that he wanted the levels of the railways.

            <p><a name="d0e8945"></a>22003 - Webster - Mr. Griffin having those levels developed on a 200 feet to
                                       the inch basis do you ask me to believe that Mr. Griffin would not inform
                                       the minister of that fact?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8948"></a>Hill - Any reference to the 200 feet plan was purely in regard to road work.

                                       When in hilly districts Griffin in his private practice made curved roads we
                                       had to do the calculations in our private office and pay the surveyors as if
                                       they had done them. They tried to get a law passed making curved roads

                                       those were not square because some of them were drawn laterally and they
                                       were in alternate directions. I say again that within an individual square
                                       you allow for that expansion, and you can get a co-ordinate even from a
                                       distorted plan with quite reasonable accuracy if you use it the right way.
                                       But that has nothing to do with me and Mr. Griffin must know the trouble we

                                       have been selected from others, and are as nearly accurate as any that are
                                       likely to be produced." This refers to the Whatman plans; it does not refer

            <p><a name="d0e9112"></a>Scrivener - If I recollect aright we drew two sets of co-ordinates: We drew
                                       sets of co-ordinates with <a name="211"></a> [Note: Mount] Stromlo, and we advised that
                                       the co-ordinates in blue had their origin at Stromlo and were on the Stromlo
                                       meridian.

            <p><a name="d0e9118"></a>20744 - Griffin - These being co-ordinates from Ainslie, it would be
                                       perfectly impossible to plot from the co-ordinates from Ainslie any bearings
                                       depending on the Stromlo meridian?

            <p><a name="d0e9127"></a>Scrivener - It is a function of both latitude and longitude, principally
                                       longitude.

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9145"></a>Scrivener - It is about six minutes of arc I should say.

            <p><a name="d0e9148"></a>20749 - Griffin - In my letter to you of the 24th December, I pointed out to
                                       you that the actual convergence was about fifteen minutes and not six
                                       minutes as calculated on which we were trying to lay out the city?

            <p><a name="d0e9151"></a>Scrivener - But the meridian of Ainslie was not the meridian of Ainslie; it
                                       is the adopted meridian of Ainslie, not the true meridian. My recollection
                                       is that the convergence should have been from the end of the south base. We
                                       have the correct meridian no doubt; but I do not remember the circumstances.

                                       acceptor was invited to Australia to supervise the lay-out on the basis of
                                       the ....adopted scheme. (The officials continually spoke of the revised plan
                                       but there was none such. The original plan was adopted.) By the slow process
                                       sanctioned by immemorial official usage the plans have gone back to the
                                       original designer for another revision. While the difference which has
                                       arisen between Mr. Griffin and the Minister may be left till time had thrown
                                       light on the curiously tortuous methods through which the plans ....have had
                                       to pass, there is quite enough evidence available to show that a settlement
                                       ought to have been arrived at many months ago. The country is entitled to a

                                       time and that of his office to useless work and at the same time the demands
                                       on time and strength to such an extent and in such a way as would break down
                                       the physical strength of some men and the mental powers of others.)

            <p><a name="d0e9188"></a>the same surveys. The contour surveys were lithographed on that scale, and
                                       the conditions of the competition required the plan to be drawn on those
                                       lithographs. My basic plan was drawn on a scale of 800 <a name="212"></a> [Note: sic, possibly
                                           200?] feet to the inch (the one including the surrounding
                                       districts) because that was the scale on which the original contour surveys
                                       had been reproduced when I came here. This was a much more convenient size
                                       to work on. That was done by the Department. The original plottings had been
                                       reproduced in the smaller scale as well as in the larger. I used the smaller
                                       scale as much more easily worked and showing the same facts. All the figures
                                       were legible on that scale. To produce a plan on the 400 ft scale on the
                                       lines of my basic plan would involve replotting and redrawing the whole, but
                                       the draughting would not take a great deal of time. Merely to reproduce a
                                       plan on the 400 ft scale would mean four or five weeks' drafting. I could
                                       see no advantage in the larger scale for the purpose required then, and it
                                       is a more unwieldy size.

            <p><a name="d0e9318"></a>Mr. Kelly - Primarily it was to enable me to look into these criticisms and
                                       into the question of the lay-out and completion of the city. Of course, I
                                       wanted to see Mr. Griffin before I could come to any definite decision in
                                       regard to him. A man might be a brilliant designer and yet be possessed of
                                       no practical execution. But as soon as I saw Mr. Griffin I realized that he
                                       was a practical man as well as one who is possessed of the gifts with which
                                       we know he is endowed.

            <p><a name="d0e9321"></a>6183 - Mr. Kelly - In fairness to Mr. Griffin, I must say that he never posed
                                       as an actual practicing specialist in sewerage matters. His theory was that,
                                       in addition to having the general knowledge that should be acquired before
                                       setting out on any plan, one should secure also the very best expert
                                       knowledge obtainable. His investigations, therefore, were preliminary and of
                                       a very broad character.

                                       dogmatize, but he thought that possibly things were wrong in connection with
                                       the water scheme. There had never been

                                       engaged on was the preparation of working drawings. These did involve

                                       adaptations would develop as work proceeded and it would be quite impossible

                                       forth comment from the opposition, that such a situation certainly called
                                       for a Royal Commission. After the adjournment, his own party were down on
                                       him like a hive of angry bees, fuming at him for putting his own party in
                                       such a position, laying them open to public condemnation, and threatened to
                                       throw him out of the Ministry. His only answer was that in his judgment it
                                       was the thing that had to be done. It was followed by a demand for an
                                       investigation by a Royal Commission, the first stop in which was the
                                       condemnation <a name="217"></a> [Note: commendation?, i.e., entrusting] of the
                                       commissioner in whose hands the investigation should rest. The method of
                                       choosing a Royal Commissioner is worth looking into, and the fact that this
                                       case was an exception makes it possible to show what the general tendency of
                                       the system is mostly because of its nature.

            <p><a name="d0e9378"></a>When a government feels that it is necessary to make an investigation it is
                                       helpless in the matter of being able to place it before an impartial
                                       judiciary. The judges of the Supreme Court are not required to take on a
                                       royal commission unless they wish it, of course their refusal is supposed to
                                       be on their having too much else to do, however the position rests with the
                                       judges, naturally, as in this case when they scent the conflict with the
                                       bureaucracy in which there is the risk of it being perfectly apparent to the
                                       public that the bureaucracy is wrong. They will not be inclined to take upon
                                       themselves the onus either of failing to condemn the officials or of
                                       condemning then, and thus bringing down upon themselves the enmity of the
                                       whole bureaucracy. For not only is it the opening up of opportunities, for
                                       promotion rests particularly in the hands of the officials with the whole
                                       press to back them, but they have every facility for injuring or destroying
                                       the standing of any member of the community.

                                       other to render the judgment to its advantage. A system so perfectly
                                       arranged for the purpose of corruption will of course be corrupt as a rule
                                       in its procedure. Marvelously, either because of the integrity of the
                                       barrister who finally accepted the position of royal commissioner or because
                                       of the marvelous case made by the Postmaster General, the commission
                                       resulted in condemnation of the officials. That there could be no pressure
                                       from the other side is apparent from the fact that they had no reward in
                                       their hands nor within their reach in which they could possibly offer to
                                       influence the commissioner.

            <p><a name="d0e9392"></a>It may be interesting to note the system of another of the judicial
                                       departments, the county court, similarly and ingeniously organized to
                                       facilitate corruption. Here the judges sit in certain courts in rotation,
                                       but at any time one of them may be transferred (by what authority?) to
                                       another court and another judge temporarily takes his place. This means that
                                       if the officials or their friends wish to have a position made in advance of
                                       the trial, all that is necessary is that some one of the group of judges
                                       shall be their tool, since any of the other of the judges can be supplanted
                                       at any required moment by their tool.

            <p><a name="d0e9395"></a>Under such circumstances the unwary litigant is helpless in regard to an
                                       appeal for the usual procedure of the court is to have no stenographic notes
                                       taken of the case. This means that the judge at his desk jots down whatever
                                       he feels inclined to which as in the case of our own experience, included
                                       none of the evidence against the Civil Service, and would doubtless exclude
                                       whatever was deemed advantageous to the other side. The verdict then becomes
                                       a thing manufactured out of whole cloth, and, since there is no pleading of
                                       the case or questioning of witnesses in the appeal, there is nothing on
                                       which the higher court can base any reason for reversing the judgment - a
                                       very simple, neat and effective system.

            <p><a name="d0e9403"></a>The first point to be decided was whether the officials would be allowed
                                       legal counsel for which they were asking permission. Mr. Webster was
                                       undertaking to carry the burden of the Government investigation on his own
                                       shoulders and felt there was no occasion for the government going to the
                                       expense of supplying legal assistance which would only tend to obscure and
                                       confuse facts which the government had the right to grant directly from its
                                       officials. There the questioning was entirely done by the Postmaster General
                                       before whom the various parties gave their evidence. His tremendous task in
                                       bringing facts to the surface in spite of the twisting of these officials,
                                       with their long experience with this art in the case where practically all
                                       the evidence was necessarily on technical matters, was a most marvelous
                                       feat.

            <p><a name="d0e9406"></a>His capacity was instanced in one branch of engineering after another, in
                                       getting a statement to its essentials from the engineers with whom Mr.
                                       Griffin had been connected and in understanding its bearing on the works
                                       that had been executed by the officials, and so mastering it as to be
                                       impossible to be confused, and to be able to hold to essential points
                                       against all dodging, diluting and twisting of the officers who were of
                                       course assisted by engineers friendly to themselves, resulted in the
                                       exposure which showed the officers guilty of insubordination, incompetence,
                                       wastefulness and dishonesty.

                                       conscription had led him to join with the opposite party in the formation of
                                       a coalition Government. It would therefore still be necessary to hasten
                                       another election to get rid of this last stumbling block, although in the
                                       meantime every effort was made to discredit him and to force him out of the
                                       Ministry. This they failed to bring about, so it was not until the following

            <p><a name="d0e9420"></a>During the first six years of Mr. Griffin's direction of the Federal Capital
                                       construction, he was under 8 different Ministers of Home Affairs. We begin
                                       to glimpse the truth that the changes from one party to another in the
                                       Parliamentary System do not signify the sensitiveness of this system to
                                       public opinion or control. The public has nothing whatever to do with
                                       throwing the Party out of power, nor have they any power at any time to do
                                       it, although some subterfuge is always used to make it appear to do so.
                                       Their powerlessness to bring this about was illustrated recently in
                                       Australia when during a campaign the Prime Minister was caught by the
                                       ingenuity of a very conspicuous and able citizen and forced into making a
                                       promise to the people that he would not introduce conscription without
                                       referring it to the vote of the people and that if in this referendum the
                                       vote was against conscription he would resign. The vote was against
                                       conscription but Mr. <a name="218"></a> [Note: William Morris] Hughes continued to remain
                                       in office. The method by which this was brought about was through the
                                       safeguard of the colonial system by which in any real emergency the Governor
                                       General, who has the final power, makes use of it. In this case since Hughes
                                       was an entirely satisfactory tool of the London interests the game was for
                                       him to resign, which he did thus was his pledge to the people supposed to be
                                       kept. When however the confirming of a new government was put to the
                                       Governor General which is supposed to be a pure formality, he refused to
                                       accept the resignation of Mr. Hughes who thereupon went merrily on in his
                                       office.

            <p><a name="d0e9426"></a>These things show how absurd it is to suppose there is a vestige of democracy
                                       in the colonial system whether the colony be called crown colonies or
                                       dominions. Of course all the rewards for service for a Prime Minister lie in
                                       London. The people of his own community have nothing to offer him. Here
                                       again we see the impossibility of imperialism's giving up the system of
                                       granting titles in the branches, from which Canada at the present moment is
                                       trying to escape. A recent instance of the direct control of the Prime

            <p><a name="d0e9574"></a>The construction of the building is as nearly fireproof as possible, all
                                       ordinary precautions being taken to prevent fires, the main materials being
                                       - Barrabool Hills stone, employed for its soft grateful color and splendid
                                       quality for the exterior, backed up by walls of brick and concrete. The
                                       ground floor is entirely of concrete, largely reinforced, and the second
                                       floor of reinforced concrete carried on concrete beans and permasite tiles
                                       making it practically sound proof. Interior bearing walls are of brick or
                                       reinforced concrete and partition walls of permasite tile. The only timber
                                       construction in the entire building is the roof of the students' quarter,
                                       recreation and education buildings and even here it is only the framing as
                                       the ceilings are of metal lath and plaster which is practically fireproof
                                       and the covering is of tile. In the interior finish also wooden construction
                                       is reduced to a minimum. The Cloister corridor floors as well as the stairs
                                       are of tile, while all of the rooms have a coved base course and border of
                                       magnesite surrounding the floor of Cork Carpet which has all the virtue of
                                       linoleum added to which it is longer lived, is warmer and more grateful to
                                       the feet. The windows and doors with frame of Jarrah, have plaster returns
                                       so that the narrow jamb lining is the only wood trim used in the building,
                                       the doors themselves being five ply solid flush veneer panels which are
                                       practically fireproof as well as the most sanitary construction known. The
                                       building will be screened throughout, every window and door as well as the
                                       entire cloister being protected from those carriers of filth and disease,
                                       the flies and mosquitoes. In fact throughout the entire structure the most
                                       modern hospital practice has been adhered to in the details that make for
                                       cleanliness and ease of maintenance.

                                       the architect to ensure a complete and harmonious whole. In the furniture
                                       the same result has been attained as in the building itself, the ideals of

            <p><a name="d0e9626"></a>In these days of architectural renaissance, when all the world over men are
                                       beginning to speak their minds in what is almost a new language in concrete

                                       new ideas and independent thinking bids fair to outrival the great Gothic
                                       upheaval of the Middle Ages - it is interesting to realize that here in
                                       Australia, a young country whose architectural history has yet to be
                                       written, the seeds of new and revolutionary ideas should be already sown and
                                       flourishing.

            <p><a name="d0e9632"></a>For now that the lamp of revolution has been lit, and Australia is beginning
                                       to catch a preliminary reflection from its beams, we are finding that a good
                                       deal more has been happening in this direction than we would suppose, and
                                       that there has been going on quietly amongst us the development of a new
                                       scientific architecture ever since Walter Burley Griffin came to Australia
                                       about sixteen years ago.

            <p><a name="d0e9635"></a>To the Australia public he needs no introduction. His prize-winning plans for
                                       the lay-out of the Federal Capital served that purpose. The building of the
                                       Capitol Theatre (Melbourne) and Newman College (Melbourne University) made
                                       us a little better acquainted with him. Everyone is familiar with the
                                       strange and arresting beauty of the Capitol Theatre. Newman College is not
                                       generally known; it is doubtful indeed if Melbourne realizes what a precious
                                       architectural possession it is. Though so absolutely different in type,
                                       these buildings express the same art and the same scientific purpose. While
                                       not classical in the conventional sense, Newman has an effect of pure and
                                       gracious serenity. Its logical simplicity and freedom from architectural
                                       platitudes impart to it a thoughtful and appropriate dignity. In its design
                                       only the simplest forms have a logical explanation. As the architect says
                                       himself, in his introduction to the plans, "art simply involves
                                       co-ordinating all the elements of environment, site, functional forms,
                                       facilities, material, texture and color, that can

            <p><a name="d0e9668"></a>The architecture of Newman College, which is the work of Walter Burley
                                       Griffin the Great, has been much criticized and is the subject of further
                                       disparaging remarks in the latest issue of the University Students'
                                       Magazine. One cultured gentleman has said that the building looks like a
                                       factory, and another that it has the appearance of a barracks. It certainly
                                       does differ from the stately Trinity, the inspiring Ormond and the severe
                                       Queen's, but to my eyes it is not inferior to any of these, and when its
                                       complete design is fulfilled will look better than the others. Its main
                                       feature is that there are no long corridors, but two story groups of eight
                                       flats, accommodating eight students, each opening off external cloisters.
                                       There is no question that this arrangement makes the students concerned far
                                       more comfortable than if the old plan were followed and that, after all, a
                                       college is built to suit the comfort of the students.

                                       shortly after his arrival in Melbourne, the movement being given an impulse
                                       by a donation of &pound;30,000 for bursaries <a name="228"></a> [Note: student scholarships?].
                                       The foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Carr in June 1916 and the
                                       building was opened free of debt.

                                       transportation. (Laughter) The danger, he said, was that Dr. Mannix would be
                                       smothered with the affection of his people. (Cheers) The State police had
                                       failed to rescue him from that danger and the Commonwealth police should be
                                       tried. (Great laughter) The prime Minster (Mr. Hughes) should wish to
                                       protect Dr. Mannix more than anyone else in the Commonwealth. (Great

                                       was the dream and ambition of the late Archbishop Carr and it was a monument
                                       to the magnificent work done by Dr. Carr during 31 years in Melbourne. Mr.
                                       Donovan of Sydney had given the endowment for bursaries on condition that
                                       the college was built at once and, in spite of the drought, the war and the
                                       attacks on himself, the work had been completed (Cheers) It was necessary
                                       that there should be a large endowment fund as it was his aim that the
                                       brilliant sons of a poor man should have a full opportunity of a university
                                       education. The building is of Barrabool Hills stone. It is equipped and
                                       furnished in modern style. The college is taxed to its full accommodation,
                                       there being 56 students. The acting rector is the Rev. J. O'Dwyer formerly
                                       of St. Xavier's, Kew. The contractor was Mr. B. Moriarty.

                                       came in with a sketch, on a usual small sized envelope, which he had made on

                                       contact the Assistant Prime Minister who was in charge of the Federal
                                       Capital. The train was a sort of Members club house. He had been given the
                                       job of doing the Newman College of the Melbourne University. The whole thing
                                       was there on that envelope plus what he had in his head. It was settled and
                                       so it was built, but that was a war to the finish too for everything was
                                       totally different from anything anybody had in mind. In the end there was

                                       Griffin from the right answer. To him there was nothing but the right
                                       answer.

            <p><a name="d0e9786"></a>The stone of the Barrabool Hills was not considered desirable as there was
                                       much evidence of its not weathering satisfactorily. But its use would save a
                                       big item in cost over the usual alternative of bringing the stone down from
                                       Sydney and this would give Griffin a freer hand in designs so he visited the
                                       towns around the Hills and found that where the stone had been laid properly
                                       on its bed it had stood aging perfectly. The character of this stone was a
                                       determining factor in the design - the flat receding arches leaving no
                                       chance for wear by weather.

            <p><a name="d0e9789"></a>The building is as satisfying as those of Europe of the good old times but is
                                       in no sense imitative, the whole determined by the nature of the stone and
                                       the problems of its occupancy. Some of the opposition of the chief donor too
                                       strong to be taken lightly was amusing. It was chiefly directed against the
                                       modern plumbing for he considered the "thunder Mug" universal in his
                                       experience (for up till some time later there was no sewer system in either
                                       Sydney nor Melbourne) and that of his ancestors was quite sufficient and
                                       that any expenditure in that line was not to be thought of. But Griffin's
                                       arrangement, making a unit of four studies and bedrooms on each floor,
                                       eliminated the necessity of even a house maid which the committee considered
                                       so advantageous that the plumbing, that is the design of the building, was
                                       accepted.

                                       other - the recreation building, each connected with the domed building's
                                       one the great dining hall, the other the library building - by two stories
                                       of dormitories and cloisters. These dormitories extend at right angles to
                                       each other from the domed building and each terminates in one of the service
                                       buildings, these again set at right angles - a truly magical conception.

            <p><a name="d0e9867"></a>City life seems to be inevitable. Man is a gregarious animal and loves his
                                       kind. But in this great land of open spaces gregariousness is overdone. One
                                       would think there was a limit to Australian soil to judge from our
                                       overcrowded and rather ugly cities, products of a tendency to follow in the
                                       gouty footsteps of John Bull, and a lack of imagination and artistic
                                       temperament which is truly British. When the climate and the open air life,
                                       combined with aggressive propaganda by the free spirits of today, have freed
                                       this budding Commonwealth from the grip of Mammon and the regime of the
                                       Philistine, we will begin to build a new civilization. This, of course, will
                                       call for new institutions. But first we must have new ideas. These are the
                                       ground-plan of the new Commonwealth, in which life will be lived as a fine
                                       art. Sounds Utopian, no doubt, to the matter of fact mind but sooner or
                                       later all of us will be Utopians. Even Columbus, who set out in a boat
                                       headed due west to seek the East Indies was utopian. But he arrived.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9870"></a>Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, is kind of Columbus in his
                                       way. He has left the beaten track and launched out on the lonely waters,
                                       hoping to reach the city of his dreams some fine day. To drop rather a mixed
                                       metaphor, he has started to build a suburb by the shores of Sydney Harbor -
                                       out of ideas. It is true he will use solid stone and a certain amount or
                                       mortar and wood, and things material of that nature, but he depends for his
                                       effects on ideas. He is a kind of a landscape architect - a painter of
                                       effects, in stone, and lime, and elevations. A British painter of genius was
                                       once asked how he mixed his paints. He replied &#8211; "With brains, Sir." Mr.
                                       Griffin builds his model suburb with ideas. The stone and lime and other
                                       matters are of the earth, earthy; but the ideas are Mr. Griffin's own. With
                                       ideas he can demonstrate the triumph of mind over matter.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9873"></a>To achieve the broad effects he aims at, this landscape architect has a
                                       canvas of 700 acres, situate on the foreshores of Middle Harbor, one or the
                                       finest effects produced by that greatest of landscape artists, Dame Nature.
                                       The combination which has resulted in the suburb of Castlecrag is a
                                       combination of Nature and Art. The native flora is a thing of beauty, and
                                       can be a joy forever. The aim of our builder of beautiful homes is to make
                                       human habitations things of beauty, if not eternal joys; and it is certain

            <p><a name="d0e9887"></a>The dwellings in this new suburb are designed to harmonize with their natural
                                       surroundings. The roads of easy grades sweep along the bluffs, and flow in
                                       curves which please the eye. The houses are inconspicuous, in keeping with
                                       the natural harmonies. As the natural flora is restored the houses will
                                       nestle into place, so that the slopes, as they arise from the water's edge,
                                       will be as completely garden as they were before being devastated by the
                                       hand of the vandal.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9890"></a>The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre. When each allotment is
                                       built upon, everyone will have a view of the stage and its setting, and in
                                       every direction the eye will encounter a garden, instead of a brick wall or
                                       an ugly fence. This effect is brought about also by the houses being placed
                                       so that they do not occupy a set building line, but are so placed that they
                                       conform to the general plan, which does away with all appearance of
                                       crowding, and almost entirely conceals the houses by the trees, shrubs and
                                       climbers.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9893"></a>The flat roofs add to this garden effect. By degrees the splendid blossoming
                                       evergreen climbers, hardy in this climate, will cover or embower roofs as
                                       well as walls.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9896"></a>Viewed as a town planning effort, Castlecrag not only accepts and makes the
                                       most of natural surroundings, but meets all the needs of a human community.
                                       The homes are planned for the greatest economy for the occupier and the

                                       life, based on a new Australian idea. That idea is that it is absurd for
                                       Australians to keep following in the gouty footsteps of old John Bull or to
                                       ape Uncle Sam. They must think out a new civilization, and begin to draw up
                                       the ground plan of the new institutions. The idea may be summed up in a
                                       phrase; Life is a fine art. That is really what all the poets, the seers,
                                       the revolutionaries of the ages have seen in their minds' eyes. It was the
                                       vision that Moses beheld from the Mount ere he passed behind the veil. Life
                                       as a fine art flourished on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in days long
                                       fled; in lands where corn and wine abounded; where song and music and drama
                                       made life resplendent; where man surpassed himself and became superman - all
                                       this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the shores of the Pacific.
                                       Castlecrag is a step toward the Australian ideal - a new Civilization, an
                                       Australia white in soul.

                                       form of government which arose when the government formed a liaison with the
                                       economic life of the mechanical period. It is called the machine age and it
                                       does not meet the requirements of the 20th century. It was not an essential
                                       unity and the mesalliance has become more and more apparent till now the
                                       divorce of these two realms has become an urgent necessity. It expressed
                                       itself in the carrying on of relations with conquered and colonial
                                       communities and later in dealing with neighboring states. In its later
                                       development the same methods are being applied to the citizenry within the
                                       boundaries of the central unit and it is now generally designated as
                                       totalitarianism&gt;. The word communism no longer has any meaning. It is simply
                                       perfected totalitarianism.<a name="239"></a> [Note: The last two sentences are

            <p><a name="d0e9980"></a>This last step lies in the Government's recognition of its natural advantage
                                       over its partner, the business world, which it does everywhere now, and in
                                       using its power first in bossing it then in taking business entirely into
                                       its own hands. In doing this the community has the strength only of a beam,
                                       properly the community should have the strength of a triangle. The
                                       government is but one angle of this trinity and fails in its true function
                                       which is to maintain Equity which requires that it safeguard the development
                                       of individual ability. Failing this the evolution of humanity ends for the
                                       aim of evolution is to bring into existence a being who can function in Free

                                       they get busy and do something themselves. If they have placed power in
                                       someone's hands and find it not pleasant let them not waste time in
                                       expecting one not to use it. He is in fact under obligation to use the power

                                       economic affairs whereas its task is to watch over the economic affairs to
                                       maintain equity comparable to the task of the traffic policeman. The
                                       business men of America could so easily rectify that whole position if they
                                       would quit asking the government for monopolies the granting of which simply
                                       upsets the whole traffic system. With clean hands they could see to it that

                                       soul. We can't blame the political organ for taking this on if there is no
                                       other organ in the community to fulfill this need. Nor have we any right to
                                       complain if it makes a mess in its attempts. We ourselves are requiring an
                                       impossible thing of it.

                                       census figures. In 1895 the population of Argentina was 3,954,911; that of
                                       Australia was 3,491,621. In 1914 the number of people living in Argentina
                                       had just about doubled and was 7,885,237. In that year Australia's
                                       population was only 4,940,952. That is to say, 25 years ago there were only
                                       half a million fewer people in Australia than in Argentina, but seven years
                                       ago Argentina had swung almost 3,000,000 ahead and today the population of
                                       this progressive South American State is probably twice that of the
                                       commonwealth. Not only so, but it is certain to receive vastly more
                                       emigrants than we .....Their arrival will inevitably give a tremendous
                                       impetus to production, commerce and manufacture." The cause of this
                                       difference lies largely in the greater perfection of the Civil Service in
                                       Australia which prevents the development of individual initiative and of
                                       course has none itself as that is a human and not a state faculty.

            <p><a name="d0e10020"></a>For an American to comprehend the significance of certain things it is
                                       necessary for him to know that so long as a bureaucracy exists at all it has
                                       the character of immortality. A permanent officialdom never dies. It acts as
                                       a unit and any temporary loss it proceeds to make up for. It does not need
                                       to accomplish its results in a life time nor in a generation nor during a
                                       particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group during a
                                       particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group of individuals
                                       who have been stung into activity, nor in a decade nor in a century. The
                                       episode of the revolt in the 18th century of the Americans has no look of
                                       permanence to the bureaucracy from which it broke away, and bit by bit they
                                       prepare the way to remove the influence threatening their organization. This
                                       alone is sufficient to bring about a war of Britain or as it now stands a
                                       United Europe (Russia is Asiatic) against America, its (bureaucracy's)
                                       natural enemy.

                                       based on a thoroughly entrenched Civil Service, and military too of course.
                                       En route to our destination - Australia - we spent a day in Roturua, New
                                       Zealand. Among the many interesting experiences there, among the Maoris, was
                                       one which included a divorce case in which the whole day was occupied in the
                                       conference of the two tribes concerned, with accusations, placations and
                                       final adjustment and the conciliation feast. In the evening we went to the
                                       theatre for the Maori dancing and singing and were intensely amused with
                                       what we later took much more seriously. Over the Proscenium arch was a
                                       picture of George, Rex, <a name="242"></a> [Note: George V] and below a painting of four
                                       flags one of them the flag of the United States. (This in 1914.)

            <p><a name="d0e10034"></a>The second amusing incident was in Melbourne shortly after the outbreak of
                                       the war when I went, as required, to the police station to register as an
                                       alien. A big husky officer sat at his desk with a huge volume in front of
                                       him. I told him what I had come for and to his question as to my
                                       nationality, said I was an American. "Oh," he said, pushing the book aside,
                                       "Then you are not an alien." "But I am." I said, "If I don't register I'm
                                       likely to get into trouble." "But I mean," said he, "What country do you
                                       belong to?" "I belong to the United States of America," I said. "Well then
                                       you are not an alien," he said settling back in his chair. "But yes, I am an
                                       alien," I said. "What country do you belong to: like Italy or France or
                                       Germany," he said. "Yes," I said. "The country I belong to is not Italy nor
                                       France nor Germany, but the United States of America." "Then you're not an
                                       alien," he said. "Yes," I said, "It's this way. The Canadians are Americans
                                       too but they still belong to the British Empire so they are not aliens but
                                       the United States of America does not belong to the British Empire so they
                                       are aliens." And wide eyed and full of astonishment he said, "Ohhhhhhh!" and
                                       permitted me to sign the book.

                                       transpiring before his eyes in his own country. He sees the menace of the

                                       which he had been working enthusiastically and which has so nearly reached
                                       perfection in the United States that it is becoming safe for the Imperial
                                       bureaucracy to take the next step.

            <p><a name="d0e10048"></a>There has been continuous propaganda carried on in the United States in
                                       educational quarters. In the universities it is quite common for professors
                                       to advocate the Parliamentary system as versus the Congressional; for
                                       students to be impressed with the idea that the British political system,
                                       though nominally monarchical, is in reality more democratic more directly
                                       sensitive to the people, than the American. Nothing could be farther from
                                       the truth. The British is an almost inconceivably perfect bureaucratic
                                       system and the Parliamentary form of government is a perfect tool for it,
                                       and the politicians are powerless to do anything contrary to the wish of
                                       officialdom, even Winston Churchill as instanced in the <a name="243"></a> [Note: Sir
                                       Stafford] Cripps&#8212;Indian event, such a clever camouflage with which to
                                       deceive the public into thinking it has power and control. But when a civil
                                       servant comes to Mr. Churchill and says, "But Mr. Churchill that can't be
                                       done." Mr. Churchill sends the cable to India, knowing that he will promptly
                                       be thrown out of office if he doesn't. All the major European governments
                                       are Fascist Governments. There is no way by which the people can alter that
                                       since there is no definite period of office and the initiation of an
                                       election does not lie in the hands of the people, nor in a constitutional
                                       right. There have been attempts to throw America back into the parliamentary
                                       form but as yet the constitution stands - a unique thing in the world, in
                                       consequence of which America with 6 per cent of the population of the world
                                       consumes 50 per cent of the products of the world.

                                       come down to ultimates it is probably a fact that the real reason why the
                                       United States has 130,000,000 inhabitants and enormous wealth and Australia
                                       only 8,000,000, or only one cityful, and almost no wealth is the
                                       independence of the one and the dependence of the other, for the "Mother"
                                       country is a leech on the dependent communities and you find the wealth of
                                       Australia continuously being dumped into the coffers of London.

            <p><a name="d0e10065"></a>Again Stead (an Englishman) says:- "Australia found to her cost that when
                                       urgent need for wheat arose, Great Britain and France preferred to send
                                       ships to Argentina to get it because the journey was so much shorter. For a
                                       time it is true Argentine wheat was not shipped to Europe as the Argentines
                                       demanded gold and England was not able to send it. Sometime, perhaps, the
                                       story of how the needed gold was found and where it came from will be told &#8212;
                                       it is an interesting episode, and illustrates how excellently the censor was
                                       able to assist a government in deceiving its people."

            <p><a name="d0e10068"></a>We were there. Gold was common currency, was in everyone's pockets. Suddenly
                                       nobody was carrying gold, only paper. The gold had all been sent to England
                                       to buy Argentine wheat, etc. Result, in Australia there is a technically
                                       named "depression," which lasted for years.

            <p><a name="d0e10071"></a>This was a characteristic use of a colony (and a dominion is no more than
                                       that), adopting the policy of forcing her to limit her enterprise to primary
                                       products, then when convenient refuses her shipping to carry wheat and trick
                                       her through the banks (London controlled) into supplying the gold to buy the
                                       wheat of her greatest rival. The Boer War had similarly been financed by
                                       stripping Australia of the gold of her early discoveries, free loans to
                                       everybody &#8212; on short terms &#8212; then suddenly foreclosing. The gold had gone to

                                       War was not the first time Australia had her gold spirited away to fill the
                                       coffers of the magnates of London. Before the Boer War the system followed
                                       was to start a land boom, to assist the Australian banks in financing
                                       speculators and then pulling the strings, calling in all short term loans,
                                       taking all the gold to finance the war and leaving Australia flat as a
                                       pancake for a long period of poverty and depression. It also set the
                                       population back to primary production. Never would it do to let a colony
                                       become sufficiently self-sufficient to feel that it could go alone. The
                                       whole system of education is based on training fear and hatred into the
                                       souls of the young which forms a chain which few are able to throw off in
                                       later years.

            <p><a name="d0e10082"></a>A member of Parliament who later became Prime Minister was one of those who
                                       at the outbreak of the war openly rejoiced that the Germans had been fools
                                       enough to go to war (the 1st World War). At that time he doubtless did not
                                       know that the initiative had been taken by Russia, assured of the backing of
                                       England given it directly by the bureaucracy, i.e., the king, by the Navy,
                                       since as Brailsford <a name="244"></a> [Note: Henry Noel Brailsford?], an Englishman,
                                       says:- that assurance (i.e., that if Russia would mobilize England would
                                       back her in the war which would be sure to follow. That mobilization was
                                       ordered not by the Czar but by the bureaucracy. The answer was war.) was not
                                       given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs nor by the Cabinet nor by
                                       Parliament but he assures us it was given. This means of course that England
                                       started the war. This member doubtless accepted the idea put over by the
                                       manufacturers of news that Germany had started the war. He rejoiced, said
                                       they were fools, that if they had kept on with their peaceful methods they
                                       would before long have had the trade of the world in their hands but now
                                       England could destroy her as a trade rival. That is the European system. It
                                       is called Maintaining the Balance of Power. These things were known to the
                                       Germans then and should be remembered in judging the Germans now in 1945.

                                       is quite as characteristic of the Laborites as of the conservatives - the
                                       Liberal Party. Here was naturally good material for the use of London.
                                       Shortly after this Hughes became Prime Minister (Not by an election by the

                                       and from that time on was supposed to be barracking <a name="250"></a> [Note: i.e.,
                                       cheering] for Australia noisily and even boldly opposing the policies
                                       of the "Mother Country" contrary to the fact again. He was throughout merely
                                       a smoke screen for Imperial purposes. His loud talk about never trading with
                                       Germany served after the war to keep Australia from buying in that market
                                       when all the rest of the world, Britain included, was quite ready and most
                                       eager to buy and sell. This is entirely contrary to the interests of
                                       Australia but according to the interests of Britain since it helps to limit
                                       both sales and purchases of Australians to Britain which is made more secure
                                       by the recent raising of the tariff to a point almost prohibitive of foreign
                                       imports.

            <p><a name="d0e10117"></a>Hughes undertook to put over conscription and failed because he had not yet
                                       realized that the way to do things was to be utterly high handed and he did
                                       not realize the strength of certain elements he was up against. One was
                                       little Adela Pankhurst, and one was Archbishop Mannix. In this connection it
                                       is necessary to remember that conscription in Australia as also in Ireland
                                       is a totally different issue from what it is in the United States. The
                                       interest of the Mother country is like that of a conqueror, by no means the
                                       interest of the dominion, frequently quite the opposite. An instance of this
                                       was the ghastly Gallipoli affair where Australian boys were deliberately
                                       thrown to the cannon to make a show of conflict where there was no desire

            <p><a name="d0e10185"></a>Idalia, Lee County, Florida lies on sandy palmetto flats and pine hammocks
                                       about 5 feet above the high water level of the Caloosahatchee River and with
                                       a maximum average variation in elevation represented by that figure. In its
                                       layout the problem was to match in salable lots the showing of the
                                       preordained conventional treatment. Such amenities as public fronts on the
                                       river front and esplanades were permissible only when obtained without
                                       encroachment on that assumed maximum of salable space. The site being
                                       naturally flat the roads are therefore direct necessarily. The one crossing
                                       from east to west is the diverted course of a through roadway. The north and
                                       south ways open up the best views of the river's expanse where the water
                                       vista is greatest and give access to the water and public park space for the
                                       people at the most desirable points. The lagoon terminating the west street
                                       is natural. The main esplanade commands the longest sweep of the river.

            <p><a name="d0e10188"></a>Since at present transportation is mainly from the gulf port of Fort Myer
                                           <a name="252"></a> [Note: Fort Myers?], 18 miles by water, the dock is the main
                                       station for both freight and passengers. It is placed, however, where its
                                       clutter will not interfere with the prospect or dignity of the water front.
                                       The main esplanade as an approach leads where the maximum of passenger
                                       traffic will not cross the freight handling space which is directly
                                       connected by alley shipping ways to the rears of all the mercantile and
                                       industrial sites. The electric railroad station eventually will co-ordinate
                                       with the water station in its position at the other end of the esplanade and
                                       in common with the water gate offers the advantage of comprehensive and most
                                       attractive aspect of this little community to the new arrival. Facing the
                                       esplanade also will be public buildings and hotel as well as stores and
                                       shops and the generous allowance for a setting of tropical verdure and
                                       flower gardens may well permit this village to utilize the advantages of its
                                       southern situation.

            <p><a name="d0e10233"></a>The usual assumption in America is that in Britain the King is but a symbol
                                       or but a social functionary without real political power. This is no more
                                       true of him than of the king of any other country or any time. Always and
                                       anywhere a king is more or less powerful according to his personality and
                                       almost never has a king much power as an official. But the office of king is
                                       all powerful in Britain as elsewhere since it is the stronghold of
                                       bureaucracy. The offices of the Kingdom may be held sometimes by one group,
                                       sometimes by another but always the organization, with the King as the
                                       keystone, is the all powerful political and therefore economic and social
                                       element in our totalitarian communities and they are all totalitarian since
                                       they all have but one community organization. With a king one can give
                                       titles, the cheapest way of bribing. <a name="254"></a> [Note: This last sentence is handwritten
                                           and has been inserted into the typescript.] The bureaucracy is the
                                       master and the others the slaves however manifested. This is but the logical
                                       consequence of the system and is inescapable though some are more firmly
                                       established than others.

            <p><a name="d0e10239"></a>Of all screens behind which the Bureaucracy hides itself the most effective
                                       is the Parliamentary form of government. Let us analyze the executive office
                                       in the parliamentary system. During the 1st World War who chose the Prime
                                       Minister of Australia? Who chose the Prime Minister of England? Not the
                                       people.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10242"></a>Through the exposure of Russian official documents and even before that we
                                       have evidence that the 1st World War was started by the Bureaucracies. The
                                       final plunge was taken by the Russian Bureaucracy on the assurance of the
                                       support of the British (see Brailsford <a name="255"></a> [Note: Henry Noel Brailsford?]).
                                       The Kaiser sent a messenger to the Czar imploring him not to mobilize. The
                                       Czar so instructed the head of his army who reported this forthwith to the
                                       British King's emissary, the head of the British navy who spoke with
                                       authority. He said, "Mobilize anyway and the British Navy will stand back of
                                       you." The Russian army was mobilized which according to the treaties meant
                                       war was declared by the Allies, by Britain. <a name="256"></a> [Note: Herbert Henry]

                                       have some idea of who it will be to start with, for the man who is leader of
                                       the party (which is not decided by the people) at the time of election as
                                       member of Parliament is usually, at least temporarily, made Prime Minister.
                                       He is made leader of the party not by the people but by the parliamentary
                                       members of his party. Really when anything important is on the Prime
                                       Minister is nominated by the King, i.e., the Bureaucracy. The day after the
                                       election another member than the leader can be substituted and made the
                                       Prime Minister in the name of the King. Coercion is effected by the mild
                                       phrase &#8211; "It is the King's pleasure" but if one doesn't conform one is a
                                       traitor.

                                       method of the Labor Party in Australia.) The people had nothing to say about
                                       this. If the step can't be brought about within the party then it is brought
                                       about as we recently saw in France with Monsieur <a name="260"></a> [Note: Edouard]

                                       wish nor the choice of the Liberal Party which had been elected by the
                                       people. His cabinet was made up largely of the opposing party, so if it was
                                       by common consent of the two parties this but removes it one step further

            <p><a name="d0e10288"></a>Gradually practically the whole of the government unit with Lloyd George was
                                       made up of the Tory Party, so that we have the direct opposite of the will
                                       of the people as expressed in the election. Lloyd George and a Tory cabinet
                                       suited someone or some power for war purposes and the reins were put in
                                       their hands. The power - the Bureaucracy, was satisfied so the arrangement
                                       continued. The essence of the bureaucratic system under the parliamentary
                                       screen is secrecy. The officials claim no glory. They get their rewards from
                                       within.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10291"></a>Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes visited London and served
                                       them there by voicing the "Destroy German Trade" and the economic boycott
                                       idea, perhaps the chief cause of the present war. He enabled London to seem
                                       mild and open minded at the Paris Conference and very democratic in the "We
                                       must grant our dominions some say in Imperial questions." He had returned
                                       from his first visit with instructions to put over conscription in
                                       Australia. He overestimated his powers of persuasion and so made a fatal
                                       error in his first step. This error saved Australia from conscription. We
                                       pause to say that conscription in an empire is a totally different thing
                                       from in a democracy where Equity is the foundation stone of the Political
                                       Organ.

            <p><a name="d0e10294"></a>Instead of himself announcing conscription and setting the bureaucratic
                                       machinery rolling as he could have done, he preferred to get the decision of
                                       the Cabinet as authority to act on. He failed to get that by the barest
                                       thread, one vote which was held, by one of those curious chances, to the
                                       cause of the people (in this case it was the personal influence of Griffin
                                       with a minister with whom he was lodging) for just long enough to prevent
                                       conscription from becoming an executive measure, the man having this casting
                                       vote going over shortly after entirely to the Tory side when a coalition
                                       party was formed. Hughes then took the matter to Parliament which refused to
                                       authorize conscription but voted that it be referred to the people. So an
                                       election was called for votes from former constituents (knowing he could get
                                       the Tory vote)

                                       to the people. He was made by Dr. Mannix of the Catholic Church to make a
                                       definite promise to this effect.

                                       as it can be expressed in the Parliamentary system. This election encouraged
                                       him to believe that the majority was with him and he put the conscription
                                       issue to the people and in electioneering said it was an absolutely
                                       necessary policy which the government must have, that he would refuse to be
                                       responsible for the government of Australia without conscription, and he
                                       made a definite promise that he would look upon this as a vote of confidence
                                       of the people direct and would resign if the vote failed to carry. It failed
                                       and the weeks and months passed but no resignation was forthcoming.

            <p><a name="d0e10308"></a>The majority of the people were looking for and demanding his resignation and
                                       though their feelings were not those with which the press concerned
                                       themselves yet, after all, the Australian Tories did not care for Hughes.
                                       There were the old issues on which they had fought and condemned him when he
                                       was a Labor Member. They would rather have one of their own men as leader of
                                       the Party so some of this demand for resignation crept into the press. He
                                       finally, no doubt after consultation with the inner circles, the holy of
                                       holies, gave his resignation to the Governor General <a name="261"></a> [Note: Ronald
                                           Munro-Ferguson] doubtless knowing in advance what would happen.
                                       The Governor General is the direct agent of the London Bureaucracy, in other
                                       words of the Crown, so in a final emergency can act and did so here (Just as
                                       it is in India really). Hughes was a proved trusty of the Imperial
                                       Interests. His resignation was not accepted by the Governor General, of
                                       course on the parliamentary basis that he saw no other way of establishing a
                                       stable Government with the parties as they stood in Parliament (though the
                                       leader of the opposition party went to the governor with the statement that
                                       he was convinced that the Labor Party could carry on - in other words could

                                       in spite of a majority against him in the community. He was satisfactory to
                                       imperial interests and that ended it. Having technically kept his promise
                                       Hughes continued to hold his job as Prime Minister.

            <p><a name="d0e10325"></a>We get at this time another glimpse of the method of operation of the
                                       Parliamentary system for there was a considerable number of members of his
                                       own party who were much dissatisfied with the things Hughes was doing and
                                       the way he was doing them, and they were ready and eager to break away and
                                       join the Labor members to form a new government but Hughes's threat that he
                                       would dissolve Parliament was sufficient to keep them from taking the step
                                       since dissolution means a new election which means for every member
                                       strenuous electioneering work and risk of losing his seat. This was also
                                       coupled with another enlightening element of the system. There was a real
                                       danger in the break away if they could get John Forrest, an old and popular
                                       politician, to head the Labor Party, so the Imperial forces took the
                                       precaution of giving John Forrest the title of Lord (limited to his lifetime
                                       to be sure), never before given to an Australian. This satisfied the old
                                       man's ambition and he no longer menaced Hughes. Having a King gives this
                                       almost irresistible power to the Bureaucracy. The cheapest form of bribery.
                                       Tagore learned this and handed back his title saying he had not understood
                                       its significance when he accepted it.

            <p><a name="d0e10328"></a>This is not democratic government. It is Bureaucratic government pure and
                                       simple but not an open and honest Bureaucratic government such as the
                                       Russian. In fact at present there are no governments anywhere that are not
                                       bureaucratic. It cannot be otherwise with totalitarian governments (i.e.,
                                       one organ for three functions - i.e., liberty, equity, fraternity) and there
                                       is no other form of government at present. It is time there was. With the
                                       present system, having a King makes bribery the simplest and cheapest thing
                                       in the world. The possibility even, of a title, is sufficient to keep most

                                       otherwise in so unwholesome an arrangement. One method that can be used was
                                       explained to us by a member of Parliament. With the secret ballot and the
                                       printing in the hands of the <u>bureaucrats</u> one ballot form
                                       is enough to buy and secure a whole line of votes. The one ballot paper is
                                       made out as desired, given to a voter, he gets his blank form at the voting
                                       place and brings out the blank form after having deposited the form given to
                                       him and brings it back to the boss, which checks his having voted as desired
                                       or not at all and the chain goes on. Naturally all the advantages in this
                                       game would be on the side of the officials as the forms are printed in
                                       Government offices. You see the King is a power in exactly the same sense
                                       that Parliament is a power. Both are perfect instruments for Bureaucracy. In
                                       America one flaw is the two thirds requirement in the Senate which caused

                                       "Politics must bring economics into line with moral interests." That is its
                                       one function - to maintain Equity. There is at present a hopeful sign in the
                                       World Organization which speaks not only of Security (Equity) but also of an
                                       Economic Organ and a Social Organ (Abilities) It is our job - America's job

                                       through the changes going on in Russia that it will be the first to build up
                                       an Economic Organization and to add a Political Organ limited to maintaining
                                       Equity. America's task is to facilitate this trend in Russia and to join
                                       with her in making it a World Economic Organization and to clean our own

                                       travel over the mountains going from Sydney to Melbourne you look down below
                                       to the old wagon road making the crossing at a much better grade.
                                       Governments quite deliberately always choose the wrong way first. People
                                       gradually realize that another way is better so it becomes easy to scrap the
                                       old and do another way, thus maintaining their force, still not choosing the
                                       right way if it can be avoided as in the Railway to Canberra where Griffin,
                                       learning that a change was contemplated, laid out a route with a comfortable
                                       gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old road thus keeping
                                       the way open for another tear down and rebuild.

            <p><a name="d0e10385"></a>Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the railroads in the
                                       control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America
                                       shows the consequences for individual initiative has brought about
                                       continental development in the United States. The railroads have been
                                       undertaken and pushed far and wide ahead of and encouraging settlement and
                                       development. The government control in Australia has made that impossible
                                       from the beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escape from a
                                       system firmly established where the preponderating vote of the city
                                       population makes it always to the advantage of the population to cater to
                                       the apparent advantage of urban interests rather than the advantage of the
                                       whole and the need of the future.

            <p><a name="d0e10388"></a>So on the whole, the railroads are simply links connecting the established
                                       cities which continually frustrates any hopes or plans of increasing the
                                       population of the rural districts. The problem of decentralization will
                                       probably never be solved until the radical step has been taken of breaking

            <p><a name="d0e10399"></a>the establishment of an Economic Organ. This is the more difficult perhaps
                                       because in Australia the Labor party is by no means a Labor party but an
                                       industrial organization whose interests are with the manufacturing element
                                       as versus the primary producers. Professor Meyers <a name="271"></a> [Note: Hugo Richard
                                       Meyer?], a student of railroading, has shown that the history of the
                                       railroads is the history of Australia. From the other angle, Mr. Valentine,
                                       an official of the Railroad Department but one of those whose mentality had
                                       not been perverted through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally
                                       owned and privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a
                                       definite time required 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the
                                       government owned railroad it took 247. Our own experience would lead us to
                                       take this as a typical example in the expense to the community of the
                                       Government owned utilities. <a name="272"></a> [Note: written by?]Walter Burley Griffin

                                       happens, though rarely, and only as a Temporary Official, he had been called
                                       to take charge of the undergrounding of the wires of the center district of
                                       Sydney. As the work approached completion he called the attention of his
                                       superior officer to the necessity of placing the men in some other work as
                                       of course it is practically impossible to dismiss Civil Servants. The chief,
                                       not wanting to bother, told him to find something for them to do. He replied
                                       that he couldn't and got the answer, "Well, then tear out the work and do it
                                       over again."

            <p><a name="d0e10414"></a>Of course in Australia there is always the added pressure from England's
                                       wanting to lend money and never wanting the principal to be repaid. In the
                                       tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable, miserable things
                                       imaginable. In Melbourne they ran the buses off by increasing the taxation.
                                       In Sydney the case is worse yet for with constant and often very steep
                                       slopes the grinding noise of the cable trams is unendurable and the old

            <p><a name="d0e10428"></a>The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to curbs for
                                       passengers). When the tramway department began the fight against them they
                                       offered to buy the tramways and pay off the whole indebtedness in 15 years
                                       (and they could easily have done so) but no, the government bit by bit
                                       increased the tax till they could no longer meet the expense and had to
                                       quit. In some cases the tram fares were then increased and the years roll on
                                       with no decrease in their very heavy rates. In the course of time however
                                       with increasing popular demands for buses they put on a few but first,
                                       seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old tram cars with
                                       new heavily built ones, still uncomfortable and noisy and dangerous, so that
                                       they could spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable
                                       transportation for hilly Sydney &#8212; the buses.

            <p><a name="d0e10431"></a>Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and
                                       urgently required service helps maintain the "morale," helps to keep the
                                       people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in
                                       the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in
                                       Australia, but it keeps the people busy and feeling important. I thought a
                                       pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the
                                       women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part of
                                       their efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in
                                       something they had at heart, which seemed shocking business to me who had
                                       been accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for any
                                       sort of charity or for assistance in any personal undertakings.

                                       The location of streets must be established so that proper connections will
                                       be made not only with the present road systems but with such roads as can be
                                       most advantageously laid out in the future in the adjacent properties, for
                                       circulation with easy grades and for occupation. Therefore the location of
                                       the future streets on adjoining properties has been suggested. In every case
                                       they follow the natural contours so will be nearly level roads with minimum
                                       grading.

                                       climb even to the top offers no steep grades, cheapening the construction
                                       and making motor access easy and safe. The interior reserves facilitate
                                       attaining this end. And yet the whole has a formality which makes it
                                       comprehensible and gives it distinction. The road system is not dependent on
                                       any of the roads suggested in adjoining estates but in the end
                                       intercommunication will be desirable for both parties. It would probably be
                                       years before the residential district is completed. That is of no importance
                                       so long as each thing is done correctly.

            <p><a name="d0e10531"></a>The district between Old Road and Route 16 has been suggested on correct Town
                                       Planning principles for a flat region between two radial thoroughfares, the
                                       distributive residential roads coming in at right angles to the
                                       thoroughfares so that there will be no acute lots. This is important for
                                       both economy and appearance. A portion of the Route 16 frontage belongs to
                                       the National Forest Reserve whose chief extent is on the other side of the

            <p><a name="d0e10545"></a>For many years it would probably not be desirable to develop the property to
                                       the N.W. of Old Road (to the south of the Lodge) any more intensely than
                                       shown. If a time comes when the district takes on a more urban character the
                                       transverse polygonal roads starting from Route 16 could be extended across
                                       the circular arc, diverting on an angle in the center to come in
                                       perpendicular to Old Road. The depth of the allotments could then be reduced
                                       to the normal 200' to make a sufficient interior park. The price to be paid

            <p><a name="d0e10649"></a>There are 115 allotments of 200' frontage. This should be sold as a
                                       covenanted estate which increases its value as each owner knows that others
                                       will be required to safeguard the natural beauty and so will have the
                                       incentive to safeguard his own portion. Each citizen thus becomes a part of
                                       a total police force watching out for the protection of the whole from fires
                                       and other forms of devastation.

                                       not more in its majestic forestry. The charm of the view is enhanced if the
                                       element of surprise is retained so that clearance for outlook should be
                                       local and not general. The covenant should therefore require that no tree
                                       more than 6 inches in diameter, say 6 feet above ground, could be cut
                                       without permission of the Corporation or its architect.

                                       are reserved and the picturesque Eastern portion can be charmingly treated

                                       that special pains should be taken to reserve it in its natural state to
                                       inspire all the children of the community through the coming generations.
                                       The allotments surrounding it are of sufficient area for the buildings and
                                       ordinary sports fields without going beyond the 225 feet from the street
                                       lines. In this park is the lovely Haunted Pool and the precipitous bluff to
                                       the East of it. Of course the idea is to keep the whole property as natural
                                       as possible. It should be a magnet for nature lovers.

                                       by WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10725"></a>I want to lay stress on two points:- the need for decentralization to insure
                                       equal opportunity to all Australians - and on the menace to democracy of
                                       bureaucracy. It is necessary that I should explain my point of view on
                                       matters of political principles as that of an American. The American
                                       political system differs from the British in that its elements are unified
                                       in the form of a federation which means that no one of its units is in any
                                       respect superior in authority to another.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10728"></a>From the American point of view, the absolute equality of all the units is
                                       the fundamental necessity for democracy. Any other system is aristocracy,
                                       the essential point of which latter system is that certain individuals or
                                       groups are in a position to take advantage of the others. It is easy to see
                                       that the Americans might feel that in the early period after the war for
                                       independence it might have been considered in England that the close
                                       organization of the various States would increase their strength and from
                                       her point of view be undesirable since at that time the theory of business
                                       was, and is even up to the present time, that strength and prosperity in
                                       another community creates a rival and that this is a disadvantage and a
                                       danger. This point of view is, of course, quite contrary to the belief of
                                       democrats. Otherwise democracy becomes impossible.

            <p><a name="d0e10731"></a>Americans have always felt that a most vital step in the unifying of the
                                       States was the location of its capital city in a district of its own
                                       entirely removed from any of the established cities with their individual
                                       State traditions.

                                       undertakings at the time of the federation of the United States into a

            <p><a name="d0e10748"></a>From the democratic point of view, federation, eliminating entirely the
                                       ascendance of any particular group, is the only system tolerable, as the
                                       only one based on justice. In the theory of the United States organization
                                       there is no possible excuse for the supremacy of New York because of its
                                       wealth or population, or Texas <a name="284"></a> [Note: "Massachusetts" has been crossed
                                       out.] because of its great extent, or for their having any advantage
                                       whatsoever or any control whatsoever over any other unit. With this theory
                                       inculcated in him from youth, an American naturally feels that the removal
                                       of the National capital of Australia to quarters of its own would be a great
                                       step toward loosening the bonds which <u>rendered ministers and
                                              parliaments and the people impotent</u>, as they seem to be at the
                                       present time, and that its establishment in a district of its own would
                                       quickly wipe out community jealousies and develop the broad national spirit.

            <p><a name="d0e10757"></a>It is generally supposed that the reason why progress at the Federal Capital
                                       is being opposed is because of the war or because it is an extravagance.
                                       This we feel is not the case. The extravagance is in keeping the capital in
                                       an established industrial city which necessitates buying very expensive land
                                       if new buildings are to be erected. The whole site of Canberra cost only

                                       paying very high rents as is now being done all over Melbourne for the
                                       housing of the various departments. The Government of a country, especially
                                       when run on a socialistic plan as it is in Australia, is a very big
                                       business. When it is brought forth as an objection to Canberra that it is
                                       not advantageously located for the development of industries, that fact is
                                       forgotten. The same is true of Berlin which, as well as Washington, offers
                                       an example of sufficiency of the Government, with the addition of its
                                       social, scientific and aesthetic appeal, to form a unit quite large and
                                       important enough to be an individual city.

            <p><a name="d0e10768"></a>If someone would gather the facts as to the running cost of the Government
                                       rentals and capitalize it - for the Government of the nation is under no
                                       necessity of paying constant interest and rent as an individual without
                                       capital might be forced to do - we would be made to realize what an enormous
                                       extravagance it is to permit the national capital to remain in Melbourne.
                                       Single Taxers will understand that, in fact, the whole expense of the
                                       construction of Canberra can be met without any taxation of Australia
                                       because of the splendid stand taken in the initial steps in nationalizing
                                       the land. It is dimly fell that it is to the interest of Melbourne to keep
                                       the capital here, again Single Taxers will realize that that means simply
                                       that it is to the interest of the land owners, for the crowding of business
                                       into one center greatly increases the rent and that is not to the interest
                                       of anyone else, but the contrary. The rest of the people have to pay the
                                       high rents along with the Government which means that they pay twice over,
                                       once in rent, again in taxation.

            <p><a name="d0e10790"></a>capital here? In what way do I reap advantage? Very few people realize what a
                                       big business a Government is and how it is housed all over Melbourne putting
                                       rents into the pockets of private individuals. Big industries are learning,
                                       when they have to expand, to get out into virgin country where they can get
                                       cheap land. The Government organization has no such pressure on it today
                                       because it is not spending its own money but the tax payers'. Why should
                                       they bother to watch out for economies?
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10793"></a>And why is it that other businesses are coming into Melbourne instead of
                                       going out into the smaller towns and the country districts? Well, the
                                       inhabitants of Bendigo can tell you, and of Geelong. It is because the big
                                       interests of Melbourne, with the government close at hand, have been able to
                                       put sufficient pressure on it to get the Railroads to grant discriminatory
                                       rates in favor of Melbourne. We are accustomed to think this system is one
                                       of the evils distinctive of privately owned railroads and in the United
                                       States the chief reason for advocating Government ownership is to overcome
                                       this evil, but we find the same thing is done in Australia and when the
                                       Government is the instrument where can we look for redress?

            <p><a name="d0e10796"></a>One might say if we cannot control our agents when they are directly managing
                                       a business how can we when they are merely a court of appeal and a police
                                       organ? That brings us to the root of the difficulties, which is the
                                       necessity for removing the incentives and for keeping the organization of
                                       Governments simple enough to control. If a Government carries on businesses
                                       outside the maintenance of equity it must have a tremendous organization
                                       which forms a huge mass of voters who can easily hold in their hands the
                                       destiny of any politician. Private ownership can never form so huge a
                                       monopoly as that of a bureaucracy which also has the power not only of
                                       collecting the profits of its business but can pour into the business the
                                       huge sums gathered by taxation in general, thus increasing the number of its

            <p><a name="d0e10807"></a>We had a curious illustration of the failure to recognize the value of the
                                       decentralizing nature of the Federal Capital enterprise in the Town Planning
                                       so called convention in Adelaide. The outer district delegates were strong
                                       and even bitter in their desire for decentralization though they had no
                                       concrete suggestions to make. But when it came to the question of pressing
                                       on with the Federal Capital they either had no conception of it as the first
                                       necessary step to accomplish the ends they were futilely struggling for or,
                                       as is more probable, were blinded by their long training in the idea that
                                       they must be loyal to Victoria. A strange idea that what will benefit
                                       another state must therefore injure one's own. It is a big story I have
                                       started on so I can only touch on these points hoping you will be led to
                                       investigate how, for example, higher rates are charged for raw material sent
                                       to Bendigo than brought to Melbourne and on the other hand lower rates on
                                       manufactured goods sent from Melbourne than brought into it.

                                       those individuals' life time is gradually choking the development of the

                                       destroy the development of the few big cities none of which is
                                       self-supporting nor reproductive. If it continues much longer the country
                                       will indeed fall into the hands of some other peoples who have a more
                                       rational social policy. It is of prime importance that the control of these
                                       private individuals over the government should be stopped and that the

            <p><a name="d0e10821"></a>as in every European country including America is the established
                                       bureaucracy. That bureaucracy is as autocratic in Australia as it was in
                                       Russia before the revolution with the exception that before the war its
                                       military branch was not so highly developed. Whoever may be the apparent

                                       unwittingly, and would in any case be powerless for any great evil were it
                                       not for the backing of the bureaucracy which is permanent and continuous and
                                       over whom the community has no control whatever.

                                       since the members of the early parliaments, being ignorant of the insidious
                                       evils of the system, through pressure from Europe and the pressure of a
                                       public opinion (which can easily be blinded by a highly developed publicity
                                       organization to think that the Civil Service means civil service) can fail
                                       to realize that Civil Servant means despotic autocrat. The abolishing of the
                                       system is extremely difficult. Its existence forms a line of direct control
                                       of Australia by England since all the ultimate rewards of officials -
                                       titles, etc., emanate from London.

            <p><a name="d0e10855"></a>The powerlessness of Parliament and of the Ministry and the absolute power of
                                       the bureaucracy is illustrated once again by the fact that the officers
                                       found guilty in the serious charges investigated by the Royal Commission
                                       were none of them dismissed, but some on the contrary have received increase
                                       of salary or promotion. That it is typical of such organizations is
                                       illustrated in Lord Northcliffe's <a name="285"></a> [Note: Alfred Charles William
                                       Harmsworth's] recent letter refusing to accept the position of
                                       Minister of the Air in which he states that he is not willing to put himself
                                       in a position which would require loyalty to officers for some of whom he
                                       can have no such feeling, stating that there are cases where officers who
                                       should have been punished have been retained and even promoted. On the other
                                       hand Ministers who in the interests of the Nation opposed themselves to the
                                       bureaucracy are thrown out of office as in the case of Mr. <a name="286"></a> [Note: King]
                                       O'Malley and Mr. <a name="287"></a> [Note: William] Webster. The officials' confidence in
                                       their power to do this has been illustrated within the last few days.
                                       Speaking of the new party in the State of Victoria which contains men
                                       sincerely determined to try to achieve some measure of efficiency and
                                       economy, an officer - a bureaucrat - said:- "It doesn't make any difference
                                       who are made Ministers. They won't be in more than two months."

                                       recent speech by <a name="288"></a> [Note: David] Lloyd George who used adjectives of such
                                       a nature in describing policies followed during his own administration as
                                       Minister as it is inconceivable that a man in any way responsible should use
                                       if he has not, in fact, found it impossible to fulfill the functions of his

            <p><a name="d0e10881"></a>controversy between the parliament and the military bureaucracy. This placard
                                       stated that Parliament which was held responsible by the people was being
                                       kept in ignorance of facts by the generals and could not, of course, be
                                       responsible if it had to act without knowledge; that the truth was that
                                       whatever efficiency or promptness there had been in meeting the necessities
                                       of the war had been brought about by the Parliament in opposition to and
                                       only by breaking down the routine of the Civil Service. In this emergency
                                       when one General after another was refusing to accept the post of Head of
                                       the Army he appealed to the people for patience with Parliament since, in
                                       fact, Parliament was, he said, the best instrument yet devised to oppose
                                       bureaucracy. How this contest resulted, whether in victory of Parliament or
                                       of the Bureaucracy, is difficult to know at this distance. Apparently the
                                       appeal of Lloyd George in his speech arose from similar circumstances. (In
                                       fact the congressional form of government is the only one that can be
                                       successful.)

            <p><a name="d0e10884"></a>We find that the opposition to the Federal Capital, aside from private
                                       interests such as landlords of Melbourne, etc., comes from two sources,
                                       England and the Bureaucracy of Australia. One of the methods used to
                                       obstruct the development of the Federal Capital was the tremendous effort
                                       made to establish the Arsenal within its boundaries or, when foiled in that,
                                       as close as possible to it. The menace to popular government of the
                                       juxtaposition of a great military establishment with the Capital is too
                                       familiar in history to need comment. The instance of the destruction of
                                       Washington is but one among many.

            <p><a name="d0e10887"></a>Apart from the military danger, the surrounding of Parliament by such an
                                       influence would be as disastrous in its way as the surrounding of it by the
                                       great financial interests of industrial cities. The fact that the

            <p><a name="d0e10895"></a>no means countered by the encouragement to establish such an arsenal city. In
                                       the first place the arsenal committee, taken seriously by some, was not
                                       permitted by the British authorities to go to England but was sent to India
                                       where its investigations of an antiquated arsenal could not but be an utter
                                       waste of time. Should the arsenal be built on such lines it would be no
                                       competitor of European plants but a total waste of the money invested.
                                       Further than this the establishment of such an industry at Canberra or
                                       anywhere within the Federal District with its entire lack of industrial
                                       facilities, even if the design were in accordance with the most modern
                                       developments would, because of the high cost of materials and
                                       transportation, prevent its output from ever competing in the World's
                                       markets and, if continued, could be a huge burden to Australia. The fact
                                       that the Federal District is but a short distance from the coast means also
                                       that in case of attack the aeroplane <a name="290"></a> [Note: airplane] offensive
                                       naturally directed against the arsenal would easily result in its

                                       accomplished by the efficient management of Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Webster
                                       could be made a negligible thing if they were permitted to build up within

                                       bureaucracy's control of the Federal Capital as made public in the Royal
                                       Commission is illuminating. The carrying out of such an undertaking opens
                                       the way naturally to jealousies, ambitions and intrigue, and the spending of
                                       huge sums upon it would not be at all objectionable to England since the
                                       taxpayers of Australia alone have to foot the bill, and the officers could
                                       well look forward to distinctions to be granted, such rewards as often
                                       accruing to futile as to useful services rendered, and in the case of the
                                       Capital the more futile the more acceptable to England.

            <p><a name="d0e10912"></a>The British member of the international jury for the adjudication of the
                                       Parliament House, after two hundred architects had in all good faith been
                                       working for months and spending hundreds of dollars, many having practically
                                       completed their drawings, writes out to the Australian Minister that the war
                                       offers a good opportunity to break the contract with these competitors which
                                       breach of faith would make it possible to put the work in the hands of some
                                       British architect. This was not the breaking of contract with competitors in
                                       enemy countries for that had already been provided for, but with those of
                                       neutral and allied countries, and even perhaps with those of Australia
                                       itself. It is incredible that an individual or private institution with a
                                       reputation to guard could make a suggestion of such a nature if he were not
                                       conscious of support of an organization which could protect him from
                                       consequences. A Minister of Australia when deputized by a number of members
                                       of Parliament to press on with the work, most important if we are looking
                                       for development in Australia, entailing an expenditure absolutely negligible
                                       if the truth were told, says he will cable to the architects of England to
                                       see if they think it advisable to go on. That such suggestions are not made
                                       in good faith is illustrated by the first abandonment of the competition on
                                       the advice of the bureaucracy on the plea that the war made it inadvisable

                                       their advice they were advising him to launch a competition of their own
                                       devising. The exposure of such proceedings has been the Federal Director's
                                       chief work during the past three years, and they have been stopped only by
                                       their exposure.

            <p><a name="d0e10923"></a>A permanent officialdom means a monopoly. It means autocracy utterly
                                       uncontrolled and uncontrollable. It means subordination of all the rest of
                                       the community's need to its own interests. It is both inefficient and
                                       tyrannical. A single autocrat may be efficient, a bureaucracy never.
                                       Efficiency within its ranks threatens it as much as efficiency outside so
                                       will not be tolerated and if by any chance it exists it will never be
                                       allowed promotion.

            <p><a name="d0e10926"></a>It is apparent that the existence, if continued, of such an organization is
                                       imperiled by the presence within its fold, or even in the country, of
                                       experienced technical or scientific men. The whole strength therefore of the
                                       Civil Service would naturally be exerted to minimize education in the
                                       country (and therefore we cannot look for proper development of the schools)
                                       and to prevent anyone coming in from the outside world. The driving out of
                                       any such is of first importance to them and much of their time and of the
                                       money of the taxpayers is spent in accomplishing that end. Since they are
                                       permanent, there is no limit to the amount of time they can so spend. Once
                                       rid of such experts as are occasionally brought in by some Minister who
                                       hopes to accomplish something, they are free again to pour untold sums of
                                       money no one knows where. The million pounds which has been utterly wasted
                                       at Canberra, finally put a stop to by an independent practitioner whose
                                       future career is dependent on his successfully and economically carrying out
                                       the undertaking he is entrusted with can, as soon as he is gotten rid of, be
                                       doubled and trebled without interference. The policy of stopping expenditure
                                       on the Federal Capital at present being followed would doubtless be
                                       immediately reversed could he be gotten rid of,

                                       England would not object to this since futile and wasteful expenditure would
                                       ultimately of itself choke the undertaking to death.

            <p><a name="d0e10937"></a>At any rate since the Federal Capital was stipulated in the Federation of the
                                       States the bureaucracies naturally determined to keep control of it.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10940"></a>Their first lost battle was when the Minister, Mr. O'Malley, with his
                                       foresight and broad vision, insisted that there should be an international
                                       competition to determine the plan. Mr. O'Malley considered that the best the
                                       world could offer was none too good for Australia. The bureaucracies laid
                                       out a program for competition and presented it to the Minister. Their second
                                       failure to obtain their ends was when in accepting the program for
                                       competition, the Minister crossed out the names of the three judges whom
                                       they had selected and determined upon the selection of three outside of the
                                       direct control of the bureaucracy. This provoked great opposition, with
                                       backing from England and through the Institute of Architects. After the
                                       prize had been awarded in this competition the department officials
                                       suggested to the Minister that a board of themselves should be authorized by
                                       him to work out a plan for the city, using such ideas as they saw fit from
                                       the premiated plans. Not being a town planner or technical expert as
                                       obviously a Minister cannot be, he did not recognize the absurdity from a
                                       technical point of view of such a procedure. His officers were supposed to
                                       be technical men although the civil service requirements in fact make it
                                       impossible that the permanent officials should contain any experts, the
                                       requirements that any man beyond a certain age - 21 years - cannot enter the
                                       service makes it impossible for any member to have had technical training
                                       and experience without both of which a man is not an expert. He accepted the
                                       suggestion that a board should gather suggestions from other than the first
                                       plan to include in it but stipulated that the design of the city must be

                                       that were the case, and seeing that he was set on that point they said yes
                                       although, in fact, it was not in any respect based on the first prize plan.
                                       It was, in fact, ridiculed as an absurdity when it came to the attention of
                                       the technical press. However, as a consequence of this by no means
                                       disinterested advice of the department officers, the work of the competitors
                                       and of the judges, themselves technical men, was thrown into the scrap heap.
                                       The Minister cabled the King that work was to begin on the Federal Capital
                                       in accordance with the premiated plan, and work was begun but on the

                                       the evidence of the Royal Commission. Mr. Griffin being greeted when he took
                                       the first step to fulfill his duties which was a request for data, with -
                                       "I'll be damned if I'll take orders from you." When the Minister attempted
                                       to bring about a working basis he was told he would precipitate the greatest
                                       rumpus the Department had ever known if he persisted. His political future
                                       was also threatened by them. He did not discontinue his efforts and shortly
                                       after his party was thrown out of office. The case with which the Civil
                                       Service organization can throw any politician out of power becomes very
                                       apparent when we realize that one in every 12 of the population, men, women
                                       and children is a civil servant, so that in fact every two men in the
                                       community have a civil servant to carry on their backs. The voting power of
                                       such a body of men is obvious. Also their indirect

                                       expense of the taxpayers is enormous.

            <p><a name="d0e10965"></a>The next minister in office accepted the advice of the Bureaucracy, at no
                                       time consulting the Federal Capital Director, but the fearful extravagance
                                       indulged in at this time, and since exposed by the Royal Commission, was
                                       brought to an end through the exposure of the methods being followed, by a
                                       movement within the party itself which again changed the personnel of the
                                       Home Affairs ministry.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10968"></a>The power of the bureaucracy over the career of politicians may perhaps be
                                       illustrated by the fact that this Minister who stopped extravagance, placed
                                       authority where it belonged by the contract entered into by the Government,
                                       and actually started movement along lines determined by both parties, was
                                       soon afterward driven out of Parliament. The politician ambitious for
                                       advancement does well not to oppose himself to the bureaucracy. Their power,
                                       almost incredible did we not realize that an absolute monopoly is in fact
                                       all powerful, is illustrated by the fact that all of the men exposed by the
                                       Royal Commission as outrageously extravagant, spending millions of pounds in
                                       utterly extravagant or useless ways, keeping books in such fashion as to
                                       make it impossible for anyone to know how moneys have been spent,
                                       misinforming ministers as to facts and ignoring and even going contrary to
                                       definite instructions of the Ministers, still retain their positions and in
                                       some instances, as I have said, have had salaries raised or rank advanced.
                                       In fact no one can dismiss a permanent official no matter what he does.

            <p><a name="d0e10971"></a>As an illustration of the stand they took, I will cite the amazing statement
                                       of the head of these Departments:- When questioned by the Royal Commissioner
                                       he said words to this effect that he did not feel called upon to acquiesce
                                       in the Minister's decision to put certain work in the hands of an expert
                                       employed for a particular

            <p><a name="d0e10979"></a>purpose. He had been made head of the Home Affairs Department by appointment
                                       of the Executive, that is the Governor General, and therefore did not
                                       consider that any of the other rules of Parliament need be heeded. His
                                       authority from the crown gave him a monopoly of government work in the Home
                                       Affairs Department of Australia and took precedence of any further acts of
                                       Parliament however authorized. In other words the provision of the Civil
                                       Service Act for employment of temporary men for special purposes the
                                       permanent officials do not intend to heed. If this assumption were granted
                                       it would mean Parliament would have no power. In fact that is the case
                                       though not openly understood.

            <p><a name="d0e10982"></a>I have wished to place before you a few of the facts that have come within
                                       our experience. It becomes constantly more evident that if we desire results
                                       either in the way of war or of peace our communities at home or abroad must
                                       find a substitute for the bureaucratic system which is at present universal
                                       in white communities.

            <p><a name="d0e10985"></a>The control of the government of Australia by the cities has limited the
                                       transportation to the coastal districts. This alone is sufficient to
                                       manifest the necessity of the Capital's standing on its own foundations
                                       since, as the Governor General puts it, "A country population is so
                                       essential to the present prospects and future safety of Australia."

                                       to the occupancy designer. It forms a series of almost flat terraces with
                                       quite sudden drops to the terraces below. Hence the form of the layout is
                                       the reverse of rectangular, but adjusted to the succession of hilltops and
                                       the series of terraces encircling them down to the river flats.

                                       a feeling of grandeur. Let us hope each individual citizen will treat these
                                       terraces reverently. They make it easy to set houses so that one tier
                                       overlooks another giving all the citizenry unobstructed wide views. Proper
                                       consideration for one's neighbor would, in general, keep the roofs flat
                                       which gives the occupant an added terrace for use in any of innumerable ways
                                       - for landing places for the gyroscope planes of the near future, for water
                                       reservoirs which would help keep the home cool in the hot season, or for
                                       choice gardens so that from the sky the whole will be lovely nature as it is
                                       now, or for general outdoor living.

                                       establishing a series of dams small or large along every stream. The lay of
                                       the land which has been cut into deep gullies by the volumes of rushing
                                       torrents lends itself perfectly to this treatment and would add an
                                       innumerable variety of lovely features for the delight and education of all
                                       its citizenry - pools, caves, open fields, steep precipices, waterfalls,
                                       streams flowing throughout the year - to accomplish which the fairies need
                                       human help. The water supply is adequate but wasted at present. After all it
                                       is high time humans changed their policy of destroying nature because of the
                                       greed of one generation and made it their task and their joy to save and

            <p><a name="d0e11058"></a>The plan of this community provides its citizenry with all urban advantages
                                       and at the same time retains all the rural advantages. The long and varied
                                       walks will still be there when occupation has been completed, and the system
                                       of parks interfacing with allotment groups makes all the distinctive
                                       features permanently available to everybody. Every allotment has its street
                                       frontage and its park frontage so one park will not be overcrowded because
                                       other districts lack similar advantages. The whole boundary of the property
                                       is retained for the community, and park paths connect all the larger open
                                       spaces. Adventure will always be there, hill climbing, waterside rambles,
                                       wide open views and the wild life that can be encouraged to take domicile
                                       here. The whole gamut of natural features is there and calls for the
                                       romantic type of plan. In fact it would be impossible to build the deadly
                                       gridiron plan for there are hills and steep gullies, flats and precipices,

            <p><a name="d0e11069"></a>The general lay of the land of the whole district round about has established
                                       main roads on a diagonal to the North and South of the compass, which means
                                       that the ideal orientation for residences - at 45 degrees to East West so
                                       that all the rooms get the sun and all get the shade - is practically
                                       parallel to the main thoroughfares which facilitates the establishment of
                                       this bit of formality which becomes important as the building increases and
                                       adds a pleasant element of the comprehensible especially when viewed from
                                       the air.

            <p><a name="d0e11072"></a>The property, about 2 square miles, cuts diagonally across a 2 mile square
                                       district. It is an especially picturesque district the adjoining areas being
                                       wide flat ranches with hills and mountains in the distance. Its destiny as a
                                       residential center is written in its richly varied topography.

            <p><a name="d0e11075"></a>The type of development shown here could be followed to advantage by the
                                       immediately adjoining properties by extending radial thoroughfares and the
                                       town might become a city. San Antonio is about three quarters of an hour's
                                       drive to the South East and the town of Boerne some twenty minutes to the
                                       North West. That is enough for rail service. It would not be desirable to
                                       have this lovely district industrialized.

            <p><a name="d0e11078"></a>The thoroughfare between these two cities crosses a corner of the estate thus
                                       establishing the location of the Civic Center. Other radial avenues will be
                                       directed to the point where the present road - Lloyd Drive - comes into
                                       Boerne Road. Another radial avenue is directed from this center to the South
                                       West to meet Old Boerne Road, an established thoroughfare. Another radial
                                       Avenue - Bersodi <a name="292"></a> [Note: Borsodi?] Drive - could be established to
                                       complete service to the surrounding districts. Along these thoroughfares the

                                       becomes the residential area. We thus establish the Thoroughfares and the
                                       Distributive streets. Such foresight prevents the occurrence later on of
                                       blighted districts for it is obvious that business could not maintain itself
                                       on the devious roads of the residential areas. The thoroughfares provide
                                       indefinity <a name="293"></a> [Note: indefinite?, infinite?] opportunity for the expansion
                                       of business. The spaces between the radii offer permanent residential
                                       advantages.

            <p><a name="d0e11095"></a>The junction of Lloyd Drive with Boerne Road having established the location
                                       of the Civic Center, we take advantage of being on a thoroughfare to
                                       establish there a business district for the pioneer days, the buildings
                                       there being on a rental basis so as not to interfere with its transformation
                                       later on to some important monumental building such as a Town Hall. At the
                                       moment Boerne Road could be widened on the property to form a circle
                                       sufficient for 6 shops - A,B,C,D,E,F - 3 on either side of the road. The
                                       shops radiate back to a wider frontage on the great circle to be constructed
                                       later. The next step in the years to come would be to get the Council to
                                       permit the development of Boerne Road into this circle deviating the traffic
                                       to encircle these shops forming a plaza. These shops would then make this
                                       larger circle their frontage the small inner circle becoming their court -
                                       and later on the court of the Town Hall. At present and for some time to
                                       come there would be no widening of the road but simply a fixing of the line
                                       or the inner circle, to fix the frontage of the shops, and a drive around
                                       the future front for present loading.

                                       water, plumbing and power available for the initial buildings. There is a

                                       here doubtless a suburban community will first develop, purely residential,
                                       social and educational, depending on a bit of commuting for its general
                                       services though certain services and crafts might well be initiated here and
                                       become permanent, a home bakery, craft shops for weaving, modeling, etc., a

                                       so indicated on the plan. To the East of the buildings already established
                                       are quite lovely terraces for homesites and below them flat fields which
                                       might well be used as small farms - nut groves, vegetable gardens chicken or
                                       rabbit raising, etc., and on the terraces above, on Lolaberg way, are fine

                                       spots, the hill tops, around which the groups of allotments are swung so as
                                       to give fine wide views to everybody. The crystalline groups of this suburb
                                       district hang like beads on the main circuits of the Rosary. Here fancy is

                                       frontage is minimized, though ample for building dwellings on these high
                                       spots, and then the lots widen as they extend over terrace after terrace so
                                       that most of them contain picturesque natural features and all of them have
                                       frontages on the reserves surrounding the crystals.

                                       allotments on this highest terrace connect with this Old Boerne Road and so
                                       have a short out to Boerne. The opening of an old country road along the
                                       South boundary would give the rest of the Rosary Crystals district access to
                                       this drive to Boerne.

            <p><a name="d0e11144"></a>It might be advisable to use the Crystal center parks on the high points as
                                       reservoirs from which water could be piped down to each dwelling. This might
                                       be a welcome supplementary supply if not sufficient to meet all needs.

            <p><a name="d0e11158"></a>The two basic principles of Town Planning are communication and occupation.
                                       The radial thoroughfares from one center to another establish the location
                                       and development of business. If such are not established to begin with the
                                       time comes when they have to be driven through at great expense. Since the
                                       realtor wants rectangular blocks he gives no consideration to the need for
                                       direct communication from point to point and even if such have been
                                       established he plunks a gridiron system on top of them, even if he is laying
                                       it out on a drawing board. The two problems should be solved at one and the
                                       same time. This is done by establishing the radii and then bringing in the
                                       distributive streets perpendicular to them. This makes all lots either
                                       rectangular or obtuse which is just as satisfactory for building purposes,
                                       just as economical. Therefore in the Civic Center we bring in the
                                       distributive streets at right angles to the radial streets. Such a system,
                                       as it extends further and further from the center, gives greater and greater
                                       space for interior parks as should be the case as land becomes cheaper the
                                       further it is removed from the closely occupied centers. These parks cost
                                       nothing since they take up no street frontage.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11161"></a>Terrace Drive illustrates this point. Here just South of the Center are
                                       lovely terraces for residential purposes sufficiently high to give all the
                                       homes beautiful views of Park Mountain across the River especially if they
                                       are built with flat roofs. The terrace drive is kept narrow to make this
                                       possible for every house. The whole river and its banks are so interesting
                                       and so varied that they have been dedicated as permanent park with one drive
                                       along its western side open to this park - the Park Drive. It could be made
                                       narrow and winding if nature calls for that treatment. It is the one park
                                       drive. It skirts the River Park with its charming natural

                                       This method should be followed in the location of all the residences. The
                                       schools surround an interior park or pool with a bandstand in the center,

                                       doors been open to all who would come. Out of this difference of policy
                                       America has developed a different type of character from Australia which has
                                       an almost equal area, except for Alaska, of inexhaustible resources, for
                                       this talk about desert in Australia is nonsense. She has no more than her

                                       aridity as fast as possible.

            <p><a name="d0e11209"></a>I nearly threw a riot in a group of my beloved friends in Casa Bonita when I
                                       announced my conclusion that there was this marked difference in the ideals
                                       of Australians and Americans; the Australian's ideal aristocracy, the
                                       American's democracy; the Australian interest in getting out of doing, the
                                       American's in doing. The difference has been encouraged by the fact that on
                                       the whole no one has been assisted in coming to the United States. Each one
                                       has taken on his own adventure and no one has helped him after he got over
                                       here. He has had his own battle to fight and win, whereas to a large extent
                                       Australian immigration has been assisted (even to the remittance men who in
                                       a way are paid to stay away from Britain) and after arrival they look for
                                       and demand assistance. They feel the world owes them a living. They have yet
                                       to learn that they not only determined their circumstances before birth but
                                       even chose their parents and brought them together before their birth. As a
                                       consequence in Australia there is little kindliness outside of one's own
                                       circle. So little of this is there in Australia that practically everyone
                                       who moves digs up the plants he has planted and takes them along to the next
                                       place. Usually they die but that is better than leaving them for the other
                                       fellow. I remember the surprised look in a man's face - a highly cultured
                                       and nice man too - when I suggested he go ahead with building on a homesite
                                       he owned though he might have to leave it later, that he make of it another

            <p><a name="d0e11217"></a>Of our own experience with young folks we have known, when they come to
                                       America they are welcomed, given hospitality, given jobs even in preference
                                       to home folks out of the feeling that they are "a long ways from home."
                                       Quite the contrary in Australia. This is definitely the result of the
                                       differences of the social systems under which they live. Even if immigration
                                       lasted for a while, they swiftly put up the barriers against further
                                       incomers. This is carried to an absurdity in Australia where the population
                                       of a good sized city lays claim to a whole continent nearly as big as the
                                       United States. Social relations may be very pleasant but when one enters the
                                       economic realm he finds everyone, individually and collectively against him
                                       tooth and claw. The reaction on themselves of this spirit is that within the
                                       community itself ability or excellence in any direction is hindered,
                                       opposed, prevented from functioning.

                                       democracy one will find, and having been inclined to accept Australian
                                       propaganda at its face value, an American gets a painful shock on arriving
                                       there where he finds himself in Europe with a vengeance. One suddenly finds
                                       out all about Colonial America stripped of the glamour of the distance of a
                                       hundred and fifty years. Suddenly he understands why the American revolution
                                       took place and begins to comprehend the significance of the American
                                       constitution. And gradually one becomes terrified at America's ignorance of
                                       European affairs and systems. A transient traveler cannot see inner truths
                                       but when one undertakes to live in (I do not mean retire to) a European
                                       community he begins to know. Also he begins to lose that joyousness so
                                       characteristic of America, for everything he has been in the habit of
                                       hanging his hopes to for bettering the future soon shows itself to be
                                       futile. Reform movements even fundamental reforms he begins to realize offer
                                       no help. And finally be sees that though purporting to be democratic or to

                                       guarded, but for years Griffin was an observer from within the cabinet one
                                       might almost say. We must remember that the Americans who wrote the
                                       constitution were fresh from their experiences with the evils of the
                                       parliamentary system and we should be thankful indeed that they made their
                                       great effort center not entirely on escaping from a power over them but also
                                       in solving the evils of the system under which they had been living.

            <p><a name="d0e11237"></a>In taking the stand that corruption was less in Europe either before the war
                                       or now, there is a very important element that has been overlooked.
                                       Corruption as commonly understood arises only when the underprivileged begin
                                       to contest the claims of the privileged. Until that time the generally
                                       accepted standard gives a propriety to the lack of fairness necessarily
                                       involved in privilege which makes the use of the word corrupt
                                       incomprehensible to the general community. This still obtains when the
                                       underprivileged begin to object but still have no power to make their point
                                       of view effective which is still the case

                                       the power of the bureaucracy but that is but removing them one step further
                                       from democracy. The privileged element still has full power. It may grant
                                       some philanthropy as much or as little as it wishes, but that is not of the
                                       nature of justice. As the belief grows that privilege means unfairness
                                       favors are granted from caution as well as philanthropy but when the
                                       underprivileged reach a point where they have the power to enforce fairness
                                       then privilege takes to hiding and corruption begins. In spite of the ugly
                                       name this latter stage is far preferable to the earlier and indicates a
                                       higher standard of morality and intelligence in the community. We might say
                                       that is where America stood in 1930.

            <p><a name="d0e11267"></a>The next stage is to clear away all the mental confusions and realize that
                                       there is nothing to gain by attacking corruption, which is a result, but
                                       only by attacking the cause - privilege - and wiping it out of existence.
                                       When that is done attention can then be turned to corruption (which in more
                                       personal forms may still exist) and to minimize it by opening the doors to
                                       opportunity for constructive use of ability through a triune organization of
                                       the community with an Abilities Organ whose function is to give every
                                       opportunity to ability. The cause of corruption has its stronghold in the
                                       union of the Political and Economic systems. We should be able to recognize
                                       it in its modern guises. It is most encouraging to find the present world
                                       movements recognizing the necessity of building up Economical and Social
                                       (Ability) organs as well as the Security (Equity) Organ, which is
                                       essentially a police (military) organ.

                                       eyes of the law he has no rights, either to collect debts due him nor to sue
                                       for libel. But he can be sued for libel whether he says anything or nothing
                                       since speaking the truth is considered quite as libelous as speaking
                                       falsely. A foreigner is one whose honesty, intelligence, industry are things
                                       to be deadened as establishing bases of comparison threatening established
                                       methods of muddling and monopoly. The whole community unites to hound, to
                                       cheat, to defame the foreigner wheresoever he may come from. These methods
                                       are common to business, professions and unions.

            <p><a name="d0e11284"></a>The classes divide simply according to self interest. Each class is filled
                                       with hatred of the other especially the "liberals" who speak with the
                                       greatest venom of the "lower class" and who can't get away from the subject.
                                       From their point of view the laborer is not a human being but a creature
                                       with no rights, created solely to work for the upper class and who should be
                                       forced to serve his superior class by whatever means are necessary,
                                       starvation being the favorite. If they can't be forced to work, as is the
                                       case with the aboriginals, then poison them. Privilege is divine and anyone
                                       attempting to tamper with it is a traitor. The upper class consequently does
                                       not pay its bills. This is not considered dishonest. It is one of their
                                       privileges always to be in arrears. It accords with the ideal of getting
                                       something for nothing. To work for money as they do in the U.S. so

                                       pleases. If at any time it happens that a certain group of "subjects," for
                                       there is no such a thing as a citizen, attempts to urge its
                                       "representative," it's a scandalous thing talked about ad nauseam in the
                                       papers and the community generally and no "self respecting" member will pay
                                       the slightest attention to the wishes of these constituents - nor do they
                                       even in the matters on the platform, for of course a supreme power cannot be
                                       bound by platform statements which are merely used as dust in the eyes. The
                                       human creature will talk so give him a platform to talk about if he is a
                                       laborer. The Liberals sleeping comfortably, don't require any platform. They
                                       merely squirm with disgust when the Laborites talk about theirs.

                                       people and their agents are power and titles and promotions. The more brazen
                                       they are the greater the reward. And no one not even a laborite would dream
                                       of lessening the power of the Civil Service. Indeed the whole effort of all
                                       parties is to increase the strength of this despotic organization. The whole
                                       community believes in despotism. The idea of democracy is beyond the reach
                                       of the imagination. They have heard the word but it has no meaning. The
                                       Bureaucracy strangles the community. Heavy debts are forced on them,
                                       education is perverted and prevented. Out of a class of 40 or 50 children

                                       newspaper today - in the year 1945 - that England is arranging to <u>permit</u> a few "lower class" young folks to go to the
                                       higher schools. This is called democracy in Europe.

            <p><a name="d0e11330"></a>Australia is under the absolute domination of an established bureaucracy
                                       which controls not only major but even petty affairs of its citizens. Under
                                       its sway talent can't develop. It permeates all fields from the lad who
                                       enters a factory to the professional man. The former finds that if he works
                                       efficiently he has put himself wrong with the supervisor and that no
                                       promotions will come his way and that he will be one of the first to lose
                                       his job when slack times come. A good example is a certain youth we know who
                                       was a real mechanical genius. He had made a beautiful full sized motor boat
                                       as perfect in its woodwork as any that comes from the shops. The only part
                                       he had to buy was the engine. He got a job in a manufacturing establishment
                                       and, having the habit of work, worked well turning out considerably more
                                       than his fellow workers. This promptly put him in bad with the foreman who
                                       presently made life unendurable for him and he is now working on a farm. So
                                       this young man's particular abilities are lost to the community. This was
                                       Unions. Yes, but a reflection of uppers.

            <p><a name="d0e11333"></a>The architect, for instance, discovers that to design is impossible, that
                                       specifications for buildings laid down in ancient times are required, with a
                                       few supplements such as requiring window sills 2'6" from the floor. Early in
                                       his practice in Melbourne Griffin designed an office building - the Leonard
                                       Chambers - for which he made drawings, at much cost to the office of course,
                                       over and over for two solid years and which he finally threw back
                                       practically as they were in the beginning and the Council passed them.
                                       Probably they got tired of seeing "the damned Yankee" around. The building
                                       had no window sills for its whole front, between its two outside piers was
                                       glass in pattern with steel bars from the first floor to the top floor. When

                                       "How could he do that? It's against the law!" They had been cured of the
                                       impulse to design by the squelching of any such pernicious efforts in their
                                       early youth.

            <p><a name="d0e11344"></a>Within officialdom the pressure is still greater. A lad came to us from a
                                       government office because his moral nature had not yet been broken down and
                                       his parents did not exert the usual domination over him to hold onto a life
                                       job. He had a permanent job with a raise of salary at certain fixed periods
                                       of his life if he played the game but he didn't enjoy being obliged <u>not</u> to work. It didn't take him long to learn that if he
                                       had finished the task given him by his superior officer he had only annoyed
                                       him if he told him he was ready for the next. If he wanted to keep in his
                                       good graces he must, when the supervisor came around, push his pencil around
                                       and look busy. Only so can a Civil Servant attain those positions which
                                       bring them honor and glory, though of course if they outlive all their
                                       contemporaries they will come into them through pure priority.

            <p><a name="d0e11350"></a>While I was in America I, like all the pious people, was working for Civil
                                       Service reform. It took but a short experience under a perfected officialdom
                                       to realize the folly of such a movement. It is however one of those things
                                       that really cannot be grasped by the rational method of thinking. It is so
                                       reasonable, so subtly appealing. It can be comprehended only through
                                       experience or through creative, inspirational thinking through which we can
                                       perceive that this mixing of the economic with the political can end only in
                                       dictatorship which ultimately can have no efficiency. We must realize
                                       however that separation is no good if the political organ continues to grant
                                       special privileges such as monopolies, ownership of land or tolerance of
                                       private <u>power</u> of any sort.

                                       early days of the 1st World War I noticed a small paragraph in an obscure
                                       part of the paper saying that President Duschanel <a name="301"></a> [Note: Paul Deschanel?;
                                           "Poincare" crossed out] (and we must remember that he had no such
                                       authority as our Congressional President) had placarded the whole of France
                                       with an appeal to the people to support the Parliament as against the
                                       Military Bureaucracy, saying that Parliament and the President were the
                                       executives selected by the people and it was not possible for them to
                                       function in this capacity unless they were informed as to facts and the
                                       Military department was refusing to supply them with facts. He recognized
                                       the objection of placing necessarily secret information in too many hands,
                                       such as Parliament or even the Cabinet. But this objection could not hold in
                                       the case of the President. He stated that in the early days the French
                                       soldiers at the front would have starved, such were the delays through the
                                       red tape of officialdom, if Parliament hadn't taken into its own hands the
                                       forwarding of provisions.

            <p><a name="d0e11370"></a>Weeks, sometimes years elapsed in my gathering of information on the sequence
                                       of events. The generalissimo of the army refused to give this information
                                       and was dismissed by the President. Each general asked refused to accept the
                                       conditions. Ultimately Duschanel <a name="302"></a> [Note: Deschanel?; "Poincare" crossed
                                       out] called upon a general in the Saar district where both Germans and
                                       French saw to it that there should be no fighting for without those supplies
                                       the war couldn't continue, and General <a name="303"></a> [Note: Ferdinand] Foch accepted
                                       the position as head of the French Army. He was a Catholic. Now I am not a
                                       Catholic. For a long time I was very anti-Catholic. Australia cured me of
                                       that. The bureaucracies are Masonic. When Generalissimo Foch issued his
                                       instructions no general obeyed them. The movements of the Allied armies
                                       stopped, British as well as French. The Germans were welcome to walk into
                                       Paris if they wanted to so far as the Allied armies were concerned, but
                                       curiously enough the German activities ceased too (Bureaucrats of course).
                                       From a high officer in the Australian army who was there we learned
                                       personally that there was no battle and defeat at Amiens (if

                                       going, followed after. From an article in the Saturday Evening Post after
                                       the war I read that, having volunteered in the early days, an American
                                       Aviator - and other aviators in Northern France all ready to go to the front
                                       and knowing the urgency of the situation could not conceive why they were
                                       not sent forward. Finally they were sent and they saw this, to them, still
                                       incomprehensible thing, happening. There were three orderly lines of march;
                                       no fear, no excitement. Two were coming away from the front, one marching
                                       in. Those coming out were the people of the district carrying their goods;
                                       and the soldiers. The one going in was the last reserves of France, the old
                                       men. They were the only ones who responded to Foch's appeal to save France.

                                       when he said that the President of France had selected the General of the

                                       greatest editor of those years, who also foretold - out of his knowledge of
                                       underlying things - practically everything that happened during the war even

                                       ourselves, wept tears of anguish when President Wilson yielded to the

                                       direction (Commissioner) with wide latitude of regulation based on
                                       socialized land and socialized public street services, together with an
                                       ethic and hygienic authority considerably wider than police power as
                                       ordinarily construed. To encourage continuity there is provided in the
                                       organization, antecedent to the usual function of the City Surveyor, a
                                       permanent Landscape Gardener to bring to bear on the continual development
                                       and incidental problems a fundamental conception of their aesthetic aspects.

                                       made contact with Griffin on that first visit to Australia. The occupation
                                       of this irrigation location had already begun and a water tower was partly
                                       built. Mr. Wade asked Griffin to design the city and showed him the water
                                       tower. Griffin suggested that there should ultimately be a pair of towers as
                                       a formal gateway to the city.

                                       The native flora, almost exclusively ligneous, indicated the line of least

                                       borders are inherited. The unambiguous scale of Leeton suggested the general
                                       informal arrangement which can only be brought out in execution by

                                       business traffic. They are given a garden treatment by a central planted
                                       space wherein if necessary tram lines may be run with the minimum of dust
                                       and obstruction and where trees and shrub growth may be carried right

                                       are essential to trade. The avenues are accorded dignity by their important
                                       objectives and by their uniform concave gradients disposed to emphasize
                                       these few resources of the architecture of a modest village. Intersections
                                       are at right or obtuse angles, everywhere of course, for economy and
                                       simplicity of the abutting buildings. Alley ways for heavy traffic

                                       quarter of a century under Parliamentary government have revealed to me
                                       personally what was called to my attention by an article in one of the
                                       American monthlies shortly before Griffin was called to Australia in 1914 as
                                       Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction of Canberra. That
                                       article spoke of Parliamentary government as the most successful smoke
                                       screen ever devised for concealing the fact that the complete control of
                                       affairs was in the hands of the Powers that be as versus the People. This is
                                       implemented by a perfected Civil Service from which America was fortunately
                                       rescued by <a name="320"></a> [Note: President] Andrew Jackson. It is better to have the

                                       delay indefinitely whatever they object to, as this article stated, but that
                                       in a system of more or less indefinite tenure a party in power can always be
                                       thrown out by the officials by a manipulation of the votes of the Members.

                                       against their party but it is not usually so, the case is utterly different
                                       from the American where voting against one's party does not throw the party
                                       out of power. One does not wish to put oneself out of a job. It is usually
                                       pressure; seldom that a Member would vote his party out of control and
                                       consequently have to go to the bother, time, expense and risk of a new
                                       election.

                                       written into the constitution that the site for the Capital must be

            <p><a name="d0e12164"></a>in any country there may be a great man who will arise to force through some
                                       great undertaking but this often means great struggles and even wars. Why
                                       make it unnecessarily difficult? None of the influential ones wanted the
                                       Capital to become a fact, not the Empire, not the States, not the officials
                                       nor the business men. But Mr. James Alexander Smith pressed on. He persuaded
                                       the Minister of Home Affairs, an Irishman, Mr. <a name="325"></a> [Note: King] O'Malley,
                                       to put out conditions for an international competition which Griffin won.
                                       For this, the Labor Party was thrown out of office.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12170"></a>This was about the time of the outbreak of the First World War. The Liberal
                                       Party was now in power. There was an Associate Prime Minister. He was also
                                       an Irishman, Mr. <a name="326"></a> [Note: W.H.] Kelley. Mr. J. A. Smith persuaded him to
                                       invite Griffin to Australia. He did so and he was appointed Federal Capital
                                       Director of Design and Construction. So then the Liberal Party was thrown
                                       out of power. Since there are but two parties in Australia, it is not so
                                       easy for the Bureaucracy as when there are several parties and specially in
                                       Australia where the Labor Party has established the method of voting their
                                       Ministers into office. Each member having ambitions would vote for himself
                                       first then second for the one he considered the least likely to win. The
                                       unanimity of opinion on this brought the "Wombat" <a name="327"></a> [Note: William Oliver
                                           Archibald] into the post of Ministers of Home Affairs. He was very
                                       subservient to the officialdom so it was a hard year for Griffin. But the
                                       Party felt he was not a credit to them so they held another election among
                                       the Members and O'Malley again came into the Home Affairs.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12179"></a>Now the war was on between Smith, O'Malley and Griffin on the one side and
                                       the whole Bureaucracy on the other. Every possible obstruction, every delay,
                                       for another year till finally an amazing thing happened. Great individuals
                                       are not determined by race. Indeed it is now true that nothing can be found
                                       that distinguishes one race from another. A great man may arise anywhere.

            <p><a name="d0e12187"></a>great Englishmen, Mr. <a name="328"></a> [Note: William] Webster, a member of the Cabinet,
                                       who with the consent of Mr. O'Malley called for a Royal Commission which
                                       after nine months of testimony condemned on all accounts the head officials
                                       of the Home Affairs Department. Such a thing had happened only once before
                                       in British history which goes to show that although nothing is impossible,
                                       it is certainly wise to choose a form of government which does not make
                                       things that are important to the people almost impossible.

            <p><a name="d0e12193"></a>The fact that the Prime Minister and the whole Cabinet are selected from the
                                       Legislative body means that there is almost never anyone of <u>executive</u> capacity or experience, which again makes them dependent
                                       and subservient to the officials of their various departments. They have no
                                       knowledge nor experience to enable them to hold out against official advice.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12199"></a>The Legislative temperament considers and reconsiders. The Executive
                                       temperament decides and acts on his decisions. The head Executive must have
                                       the <u>power to choose his assistants and to dismiss them</u>,
                                       otherwise he cannot be held responsible. This applies to his Cabinet and to
                                       the officials. The remedy for complications should be met by limiting the
                                       functions of the Political Organ, ultimately, to maintaining Equity.

                                       that has the maintenance of Equity written into its constitution and whose

                                       pleased. I wore different colors for myself but except for a momentary
                                       disappointment felt pleased. The best crew won and good sports got the cup.
                                       We went early to pick our places. At 12:30 we owned the river. The East side
                                       of the Judge's box we argued was the best. By standing on the edge of the
                                       embankment we could get a good view of the approaching boats and decide the
                                       finish with the judge, as it were. Having settled this we had our lunch.
                                       There were thirteen of us &#8212; no doubt that was the mistake. The day was
                                       glorious, warm sunshine and no wind. The lunch was a great success; a man
                                       snapped us "The First Comers." A little after one o'clock two or three
                                       people came along so we got into position. We spread out the rug corner-wise
                                       and sat in a row, feet dangling; another two had a cushion and one of the
                                       party sat on a little camp stool. Father and the little boys went off to get
                                       a boat we had engaged. Everything possible was done to make the day a
                                       success. We, the women folk, preferred to sit where we were; it would be
                                       more "fun" and our country cousins and the friends from America would enjoy
                                       the boys' corner.

            <p><a name="d0e12273"></a>Right up to 2:30 we congratulated ourselves upon our maneuvers, but presently
                                       the "camper" had to decamp to the lower level, she not being strong and the
                                       crowd beginning to press. She took up her seat and stood below. Another two
                                       minutes and we others decided to stand for fear our backs might get broken
                                       and we got up one at a time to

            <p><a name="d0e12281"></a>maintain our positions, because by this time there was a great press and we
                                       guessed there was a crowd behind. We got up and saw and then we knew we were
                                       in for it. Our folks came over from Scotland in the early days and stuck,
                                       and we had it in us. The country cousin was pushed down the embankment
                                       twice. She rolled right over but came up again smiling and brave. But it was
                                       all right till I was suddenly pulled back and a burley form twisted me about
                                       and got in front. It was a policeman, and all at once there were six of
                                       them. The first one who was now in front of me doubled his body and butted
                                       into me. I felt myself falling and clutched something. It was another
                                       policeman who threw off my hands and shouted, "Don't you hold on to me, move
                                       back. Don't push &#8212; her Excellency is here." It was all over in a moment &#8212; I
                                       mean the parting up with our stand. Our party was pushed back into the
                                       swaying, seething mass. To and fro, backwards and forwards, up and down we
                                       swayed and ran. Policemen backed and shouted and boys pushed forward. Never
                                       did I know anything like it. Once I saw my husband and the little boys
                                       looking anxiously our way and I wished I had not been chosen to be right in
                                       the "fun." My hat was ruined, my coat torn, colors gone, best boots beyond
                                       description. Then their Excellencies were got into a boat (not having six
                                       policemen to guide us we could not get into ours) and things eased a moment.
                                       My fight was over though and I fell back and the boats came in and I didn't
                                       see. Arrived at 12:30 and didn't see.

            <p><a name="d0e12284"></a>Now being a sport though 40 (odd) I didn't mind. "All in the day," but I
                                       would like to suggest that some other arrangements be made for the policemen
                                       next time. No one would mind Their Excellencies' having the best place, and
                                       we would not ask them to picnic at 12:30 to get it, but couldn't an
                                       enclosure be made in readiness? A railing say 4 feet square would perhaps
                                       suffice. Everyone would respect this and be pleased to welcome the occupants
                                       at the last minute. I try to

            <p><a name="d0e12314"></a>Anyway Walt decided it was time he investigated the Yarra. At about 12
                                       o'clock we started off for our jaunt. We took a train to a slight distance
                                       out of Melbourne, got a boat, and of course there was no stopping Walter
                                       till we had rowed 26 miles, 13 up against the swift current of the Yarra
                                       River and 13 back getting back after 10 and finding the boat-house people
                                       quite perturbed for fear something had happened to us. They do not know
                                       Walter but they did know he was the Federal Capital Director and apparently
                                       could not be classed among our "favorites" who would have been glad to have
                                       his career brought to an end by any means the Lord might provide.

            <p><a name="d0e12317"></a>Of course he decided on all the locations for dams to hold the waters of a
                                       series of lakes to take the place of the swamp reaches the rains bring to
                                       large districts making them completely useless. It would make a wonderful
                                       park system for Melbourne and outlying municipalities. One such lake would
                                       be at the foot of Mt. Eagle Estate the laying out of which was one of his
                                       early jobs over here and where his sister's home and our Doll House were
                                       built.

            <p><a name="d0e12334"></a>everywhere in Australia too was the gridiron plan being imposed no matter
                                       what the nature of the landscape. Griffin had been prepared for what Town
                                       Planning was up against by his experience with the Fairy Harbor Estate on
                                       the coast of Manly &#8212; steep bluffs, craggy rocks, for which impossible roads,
                                       gradients no auto could master, had been determined upon by the conventional
                                       subdivider. The client brought his problem to Griffin who suggested the sort
                                       of thing he later accomplished in Castlecrag. But before a municipal council
                                       would pass a subdivision it had to be okayed by a licensed surveyor and no
                                       surveyor would stamp with his approval what, though it conformed to the laws
                                       of nature and the needs of men, defied the established custom of the empire.
                                       There is a sort of lese majesty in doing something so different. So that
                                       lovely bit was destroyed.

            <p><a name="d0e12337"></a>Prepared by this experience Griffin used new tactics. He laid out the streets
                                       on easy gradients with provision for interior and River Bank parks
                                       calculating all the streets and allotments and paid the surveyors as if they

                                       which he had tried for so many years to break down in his wife, we started
                                       to build the doll house on the second lot within the same enclosure as his
                                       sister's home on the Mount Eagle estate which he had laid out several years
                                       before in Heidelberg, a municipality some 14 miles from Melbourne. He took

            <p><a name="d0e12354"></a>to Sydney for the stone for important buildings; and where the bricks as
                                       everywhere in Australia were ugly in size, shape, texture and color, he
                                       invented a new type of construction, an interlocking, concrete tile, the
                                       last word in economy for permanent fireproof residential construction. The
                                       structural columns consist of two or four interlocking quadrants spaced on
                                       units based on the width required for openings, giving a charming fluted
                                       exterior wall and round corners in the interior. The walls between are two
                                       and a quarter inches thick with hollow space in which a coating of bitumen
                                       or Aquella can be placed. The tiles are one foot square and are staggered
                                       horizontally and vertically so there are no through joints. The hollow space
                                       between is enough for warmth and sound proofing. The economy in the
                                       thickness of the walls gives the space of an extra bed room in an ordinary
                                       two bed room house so that in a house covering the same area one gets three
                                       bed rooms instead of two.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12357"></a>The surfacing of the tiles can be of different colored sands used while
                                       manufacturing them so that the house looks like cut stone and in the
                                       sunshine like marble; and in the interior there is no need for plaster nor
                                       for decoration though many rich and varied color effects can be obtained by
                                       staining the tiles to pattern or otherwise. Thus the knitlock construction
                                       undercuts the cost of the cheapest brick buildings, and makes windows as
                                       cheap as walls since the tile as laid up form finished sills, heads and
                                       jambs so far as the masonry is concerned. Griffin had not yet worked out the
                                       knitlock roof tiles when Pholiota was built.

                                       home it was designed to meet our personal requirements. The floor was brick
                                       laid solid on the ground, so cool in summer and warm in winter.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12382"></a>Father and Mother Griffin were visiting the Lippincotts when the time came
                                       for the windows. For the time of their visit we were all living together
                                       with sister Genevieve's family. One day I saw father prowling around and
                                       talking something over with the carpenter farmer and, listening in, I found
                                       they had decided that the windows wouldn't work. Of course it was another
                                       invention of W.B.G.'s, a pivoted window which wouldn't slam in the wind,
                                       with the simplest device in the world for opening and shutting without
                                       opening the screen. Of course our very elegant father didn't at all like to
                                       see his distinguished son doing day labor and on a house which was to become
                                       a one room home, and he was equally disgruntled by having a tom-boy
                                       daughter-in-law who delighted in taking part in such rough work.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12385"></a>Then son-in-law Roy came home &#8212; he also an architect &#8212; and there was another
                                       consultation re the windows which the farmer had discontinued installing,
                                       and I heard them say &#8212; "Of course it won't work." The pivot was some four
                                       inches from the window jamb so you see of course it wouldn't work. I
                                       secretly reported this conference to my senor <a name="330"></a> [Note: Walter Burley
                                       Griffin] who disgustedly said, "Of course it will work," and out he
                                       went and put in a window. Of course it worked. Nobody said anything to
                                       anybody, but I kept an eye on the house and presently saw father go out and
                                       look and try. It opened!! And later on I saw Roy go out. Same answer. Nobody
                                       said anything to anybody.

                                       (for the little ones for it was in the same yard, a fenced enclosure, as

            <p><a name="d0e12399"></a>hours were often late, and the children could take possession during the day
                                       so long as they promised not to eat the sugar. But our home it was and no
                                       one ever had a more perfect house. In the two years we were there before we
                                       had to go up to Sydney. I am sure we entertained more people than anyone in
                                       Australia except perhaps the Governor General. Everyone wanted to see it and
                                       everyone had to show it to their friends. So they found entertainment there
                                       whether we were at home or not. On our return we might find embers still hot
                                       in the fireplace, or a bead from a dress on the floor, or a jar of jam on
                                       the table.

            <p><a name="d0e12402"></a>We always taught the young people in the office that they must never be
                                       satisfied with anything short of perfection, the correct answer. They all
                                       came to Pholiota for a Christmas party, the young folks supplying the
                                       eatables. Everyone brought sweets! Such a party! One of our head draftsmen
                                       told me he had never been able to comprehend what I meant by saying even the
                                       least thing must be perfect, but now he understood. Here this, one might
                                       say, costless house and furniture was perfect. The most conservative man I
                                       ever know, whose wife and children wanted us to build a house for them, was
                                       finally persuaded by his son to come out and see us. He wandered about the
                                       little home, twenty-one feet square all told, smiling and laughing, and
                                       finally said &#8212; "It's too pretty to use." Practically it was perfect too a
                                       place for everything and everything just naturally dropping into its place.
                                       In Pholiota the interior tiles were subdivided by a groove into six inch
                                       squares which were colored alternately gold and henna.

                                       corners) to screen the two divan alcoves or sleeping quarters, became an

                                       back his chair and so increasing the circumference. Over it hung, from the
                                       peak of the sloped ceiling, a beautiful fretwork plaster lantern designed
                                       for and stolen from the Palais de Dance. By thus drawing the curtains the
                                       two alcoves became two private bed rooms. The four corners usually partly

            <p><a name="d0e12416"></a>Well presently some man was called to book by the municipal council for not
                                       having complied with the municipal requirements. Such perpetual petty
                                       dictatorship in all details of life! No wonder the spirit of the European
                                       peoples is so completely broken. And venom being a natural result of
                                       frustration this gent reported to the council that the Griffins were living
                                       in the doll house. This came near resulting in an international scandal. We
                                       were promptly ordered to bring our house into conformity. Now as it happened
                                       our house met all their requirements but not in their way. It was larger but
                                       it did not have three separate rooms, its average height was greater but its
                                       minimum height was less than 9 feet, it had enormously more ventilation but
                                       it didn't have dinky little ventilators in the wall above the window height.
                                       There was no wall above the windows. The kitchen was compact and completely
                                       equipped but that kitchen corner wasn't the required area. There was no
                                       possible way of making the house conform except by tearing it down and
                                       building it over again, making it ugly in proportions, impossible for
                                       entertainment, wasteful of space, etc., etc.

            <p><a name="d0e12438"></a>on the part of the Director of Design and Construction of the Federal
                                       Capital, we received a notification that if the house were not made to
                                       conform in two weeks they would proceed to pull it down. Whereupon Mrs. G.
                                       said to Mr. G. &#8212; "Well let them pull it down and we'll live in a canvas bag
                                       (as we had done in our canoe trips and which in fact would not have been
                                       against the law) and cook our meals over a bonfire. We own this lot. We'll
                                       see what they do about that." And there it stood. We concerned ourselves no
                                       more about it though we know that a townsman had recently been evicted from
                                       his home. He was a builder who had taken on a contract for a house and
                                       forgotten to include the cost of the roof. The client refused to pay for the
                                       roof so he was left without enough money to carry on the construction of his
                                       own house. The whole of his house was framed and roofed and most of the
                                       exterior walls completed but only the kitchen, dining room and bath
                                       completely finished, the rest like an open veranda which in that climate is
                                       perfectly comfortable to sleep on, which a large part of the people do the
                                       year around. But it didn't conform to the requirements so he and his wife
                                       were thrown out onto the street. Such is government in the economic realm.
                                       When will we wake up to the fact that a human community needs three complete
                                       organizations to fulfill the three necessities of human beings in a
                                       community.

            <p><a name="d0e12441"></a>One day our neighbor brought a guest of theirs in to see us. We had a
                                       pleasant hour together. That's the trouble, these imperialists are so
                                       pleasant one can't believe their system is the last word of ingenuity of
                                       Satan himself. However nothing fatal happened. We found out later that this
                                       gentleman was the State Architect who had been called upon by the Council
                                       and who had advised the Council, under the circumstances, to call it an
                                       experimental house and drop the matter, which they did.

            <p><a name="d0e12452"></a>discomfort comes not only from the cold during the four months of winter when
                                       the whole community, rich and poor, suffer intense discomfort in the houses,
                                       but frequently during other seasons. With one voice all who come from other
                                       climates say they have never suffered with the cold in their lives as they
                                       do in Australia. The solution to this, removing all the discomfort of the
                                       climate is the simple device used by the aboriginals &#8212; to take advantage of
                                       the much lesser range of temperature of the ground, at least 20 degrees less
                                       than that of the air. This is practically all that is needed in this
                                       wonderful climate to make living comfortable summer or winter. With doors
                                       and windows closed on nippy days and a solid floor the warmth of the earth
                                       comes up and fills the whole house and on coldest days a bit of a fire in
                                       the fireplace with the warm floor and the whole house is all right. Such a
                                       little thing and a whole civilization can be transformed, but do you suppose
                                       a Municipal Council would permit it? By no means. Our brick floor met the
                                       issue in Pholiota. Of course we had rugs as well, the aesthetic helping out
                                       the practical.

            <p><a name="d0e12455"></a>Interiors are things unknown to practicing architects because their training
                                       in the universities is from pictures and you really can't photograph
                                       interiors. Anyway their training consists only in the study of individual
                                       expensive buildings. In other fields how could the poor dears make a living.
                                       So we moderns live in packing boxes and the genius of our children dies from
                                       starvation in their early years. The story of a friend's child is typical.
                                       She was sent to a music teacher to learn music. She wept all the time she
                                       was there. When afterward her mother asked her why she didn't sing she said
                                       she couldn't, it was so ugly &#8212; the room.

                                       factor in every community. This one room house was one of the most perfect

            <p><a name="d0e12469"></a>A German friend was visiting us, Mr. Hugo Meyer <a name="331"></a> [Note: Hugo Richard
                                       Meyer?], formerly a Harvard professor, then writing a history of the
                                       Railways of Australia which he said he found to be the history of Australia
                                       and its lack of development. As we sat before the fireplace he said Pholiota
                                       reminded him of a castle in Germany. The bringing of the exterior permanent
                                       material completely into the interior would do this. And yet with this
                                       material and its formal units we were continually getting the most exquisite
                                       pictures with the changing lights of the day and the changing floral
                                       displays of the seasons framed by our windows. The brass candlesticks which
                                       looked silly on the piano were yanked off and looked handsome on the
                                       fire-breast giving it an altar like effect when the morning sun struck
                                       across the room giving brilliance and sharp shadows to the great clusters of
                                       flowers which stood in a corner of the fireplace alcove.

            <p><a name="d0e12475"></a>There were so many ancient gum trees on this hill sloped river bank, some in
                                       groups, some isolated, that for over half a century the artists of Melbourne
                                       had gathered there for their camping outings to enjoy and paint their
                                       loveliness. Many were five feet and more in diameter, most of them white
                                       barked, not the tall towering species but broad spreading and very
                                       picturesque. The owners finally decided to subdivide. They put the work in
                                       Griffin's hands. In laying out this Mount Eagle Estate which consists of a
                                       beautiful hillside and the flats below extending to the Yarra River, he took
                                       great pains to arrange for permanent preservation of these trees arranging
                                       the streets and allotments so that almost all of them were in interior
                                       reserves. Such reserves cost practically nothing as they take up no street
                                       selling frontage which also meant that they never could

            <p><a name="d0e12623"></a>Some three years ago an article of mine appeared in the Sunday Times dealing
                                       with the condition of affairs at Canberra. I pointed out that a Departmental
                                       Board of disappointed competitors had obtained control of the carrying out
                                       of Burley Griffin's splendid plan and while pretending to preserve the
                                       "dominating conception" of that plan, were really imposing their own crude
                                       plan upon his. I took the stand that as Griffin's plan had won the first
                                       prize in a worldwide competition in which all the great expert town-planners
                                       had taken part, if any modification of that plan were necessary it should be
                                       carried out not by strangers but by the man whose brain had conceived the
                                       original design.

            <p><a name="d0e12626"></a>At that time there were rapid changes in the personnel of the Ministers who
                                       had to deal with Canberra. Of these Mr. W.H. Kelly, in a brief interval of
                                       office, appeared to be the only one who rose to the true appreciation of the
                                       importance of the plan. His successor &#8212; Mr. <a name="335"></a> [Note: William Oliver]
                                       Archibald, a weak man, fell into the hands of this Departmental Board and
                                       the whole of the blunders which have followed, and which have been exposed
                                       in the masterly report of Mr. Wilfred Blacket, K.C. are the inevitable
                                       consequences.

            <p><a name="d0e12635"></a>What struck me as a citizen of the Commonwealth at the time was that public
                                       buildings were being erected encroaching on the alignment of main avenues as
                                       laid down in the plan of Mr. Griffin. When Mr. Austin Chapman, who deserves
                                       great credit in this matter, demanded an explanation of this, he was

                                       appreciate better since Mr. Blacket's report) that "these buildings could
                                       easily be pulled down when the final allotment of the streets became

            <p><a name="d0e12668"></a>The fatuousness of this was manifested to all those who had visited
                                       Washington (U.S.A.) and become conversant with the series of muddles which
                                       were associated with the great United States political center. It is strange
                                       how history repeats itself. One of the features of the history of the
                                       magnificent Washington plan is the conflict with stupidity which nearly
                                       drove the great French engineer, <a name="336"></a> [Note: Pierre Charles] L'Enfant, who
                                       planned Washington in conjunction with George Washington (himself a
                                       surveyor) out of his mind and embittered his whole life. One of his
                                       successors, <a name="337"></a> [Note: Alexander "Boss"?] Shepherd, was also treated in the
                                       same way and he too succumbed in the battle with stupidity. To make a long
                                       story short, when the people of the United States came to their senses it
                                       cost a later generation $15,000,000 to restore the plan of L'Enfant. That
                                       was the price that was paid by the people of the United States for the
                                       bungling which proceeded in regard to their Capital for nearly a century.
                                       Such bungling has happily, I hope, been stopped in the bud by the inquiry
                                       now concluded and the report of Mr. Blacket.

                                       a Commission. In my opinion, and with all respect to Mr. Sulman, the public
                                       reposes the utmost confidence in the man at present, though only
                                       imperfectly, in charge &#8212; Mr. Walter Burley Griffin. Those who know any of
                                       the work that has been done, and have followed the whole history of this
                                       great enterprise with interest, know that no more competent man could be
                                       found to place in control of this work than Mr. Griffin. He should be the

                                       incompetence and stupidity against which Mr. Griffin has had to struggle. It
                                       is to be hoped that the struggle is over now. Mr. Griffin has gained his
                                       experience inch by inch; he has confounded his detractors he has vindicated
                                       his own capacity, and by that means he has proved himself to be the one and
                                       only fit man to be entrusted with the task of carrying out his own design.
                                       All that remains to be said is to express the hope that the experience of
                                       the incompetency of the last few years will inspire the statesmen in charge
                                       of the affairs of the Commonwealth to make up their minds to take the advice
                                       of the one man in Australia who is competent to advise them upon the design
                                       of a great city built upon a virgin site.

                                       discussion in the City Club of Chicago. A number of solutions were
                                       considered and are being considered in various districts for actual
                                       execution. Chicago's plan like that of so many of our modern cities consists
                                       of a quadrilateral plan superimposed on a radial one. It is laid out in
                                       quarter mile sections and one such Section was the problem for solution. The
                                       method of general layout means that everywhere in Chicago these streets at
                                       half mile intervals become the lines of through traffic with trams, and the
                                       consequent development into business streets. It also means that there is no
                                       occasion for through traffic between them and that no business will develop
                                       within them because of the advantage of the boundary streets in being most
                                       convenient of access to the stream of people coming home from the city
                                       center. Therefore such a Section encircled by neighborhood stores, shops,
                                       offices, public service equipment such as fire engine houses, etc., offers
                                       opportunity for a complete and secluded domestic unit. The first step
                                       therefore is to destroy the temptation of using it as a thoroughfare for
                                       which there is no need by blocking the center so that it no longer offers a
                                       short cut. At last we have the chance to give a fair chance to the domestic
                                       life which has suffered so terribly in the rapid development of out great
                                       cities. How necessary this is we can get a notion of if we compare the
                                       organism humanity to the organism tree. If a tree fails in the perfect
                                       development of the blossom &#8212; the reproductive organ &#8212; the tree will soon
                                       disappear, or at least degenerate. So with our human communities. The
                                       industrial and transportation elements form the root and trunk branching out
                                       from the centers, but the domestic element is the blossom complete in itself
                                       perfect in form, and every community should bear abundantly these beautiful
                                       blossoms. This example promises a Town Planning requirement which in this

                                       other civic elements already established but with the opportunity of the
                                       best possible location of each element for itself and its relation to the

                                       prevailing winds for refreshment and protection; topography of surface and

                                       to its simplest elements we find has just two elements &#8212; habitation and
                                       communication, and the reason why most of our communities are so
                                       unsatisfactory in their general arrangement is because one or the other of
                                       these has been given consideration to the detriment of the other.

                                       interests of the outlying regions show a markedly radial basis through the
                                       transformation of country roads into city streets. Here the element of
                                       convenient transportation has predominated. Where an owner of property has
                                       rapidly built up a community by subdivision of land and disposal of it we
                                       find the rectangular or gridiron plan. Here occupation has been given
                                       consideration and no weight to convenience of intercommunication.

            <p><a name="d0e12799"></a>great expense. Often in the layout of new cities we find that there has been
                                       no attempt to reconcile these two elements but that the results we have
                                       grown familiar with in old cities are copied in plans for new. This is a
                                       waste of an opportunity, as a radial system is the best solution of direct
                                       access from outlying regions to a center of common interest, and the right
                                       angle forms the best shape for building purposes the solution is to use the
                                       radial system and bring in the cross streets at right angles to them. This
                                       forms no acute angles and the obtuse angles formed at the junction of cross
                                       streets are perfectly satisfactory for building and offer advantages for
                                       community purposes. With this abstract solution of the municipal problem we
                                       have now to adapt it to the local conditions and the individual requirements
                                       of the city.

            <p><a name="d0e12802"></a>A photograph of the model of the site gives an idea of the general
                                       topographical conditions though the fact that the vertical dimension is four
                                       times that of the horizontal makes it appear much more rugged than it is in
                                       reality, the slopes as a whole being very gentle. The flood basin of the
                                       Molonglo River which crosses the site suggests the advisability of using it
                                       to the utmost possible extent for water surface. The dry season sometimes
                                       very severe makes the storage of water imperative and the modifying
                                       influence of a considerable water surface much to be desired. There is much
                                       talk about proper provision for disposal of storm water but in Australia the
                                       first consideration should be its preservation. The problem is very simple
                                       when one looks at it directly with open eyes. Nature records her maximum
                                       floods and all one has to do is to provide channels for that maximum. If in
                                       the main channel we arrange to use the whole flood basin for no other
                                       purpose but the storage of water the flood water is taken care of. There is
                                       ample rainfall to maintain the level of these lakes as guaranteed by the
                                       original competition and borne out by experience since even this year, the
                                       worst drought Australia has ever known, there has been excessive flow in the

                                       that in the course of time Australia will build another such dam as is just
                                       completing at Burrinjuck which will hold back too waters to form a lake
                                       continuous with these of the Capital and extend some 50 miles length to the
                                       West which will place the Federal Capital on another such body of water as
                                       the Sydney Harbor and make it unsurpassed in natural beauties and advantages
                                       by any city in the world.

            <p><a name="d0e12813"></a>Since the special requirement of this city is the housing of the Government
                                       one looks for the most desirable location of the group of Government
                                       buildings which shall best meet present requirements and offer ample
                                       facility for expansion in the future. The site conditions of this valley are
                                       a somewhat extensive level stretch on the north bank of the river enclosed
                                       by hills and mountains those in the distance to the South West rising to the
                                       summit Bimberri often snow covered. Touching the boundaries of the area
                                       determined for the city site are three minor mountains. The most conspicuous
                                       peak is the conical Ainslie to the North East. To the North West is Black
                                       Mountain, and to the South East is Mugga Mugga with the foothills clustered
                                       about it opposite from the mountains to the South West.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e12816"></a>The plain recommends itself for the business district of the city. There are
                                       two possibilities for the location of the Government group, the slopes of
                                       Black Mountain looking up the river, or the terraces on the Southern bank
                                       rising from the level to Kurrajong, to Red Hill, to Mugga Mugga, to
                                       Bimberri. A line drawn from the peak of Ainslie to Red Hill passes through
                                       the peak of Kurrajong, is perpendicular to the river bed and is at an angle
                                       of some 15 degrees to the North and South line hence most desirable for
                                       orientation of the streets, giving throughout the day good shade on one or
                                       the other side and giving sun to all rooms of the buildings. This line was
                                       determined upon as the main axis of the city and all the public buildings
                                       throughout the city are set on this axis. The importance of such an orderly
                                       arrangement is always very great and can be especially appreciated in a city
                                       surrounded by heights so

                                       of the whole city. One of the chief pleasures we get in the contemplation of
                                       any work of man is the consciousness that results were intentional. We
                                       rejoice in evidence of intelligence.

                                       equation, the requirements or this special city. We have to take care not
                                       only of the Federal Government group. There is the Municipal group. Also the
                                       National University and the Military establishment in addition to the usual
                                       municipal requirements of any city.

            <p><a name="d0e12830"></a>The result of the solving of this equation we will express first
                                       diagrammatically. The schedule summarizes the elements. In Town Planning as
                                       in Architecture there must be a vision. There must be a scheme which the
                                       mind can grasp, and it must be expressed in the simplest terms possible.
                                       Just as music depends on simple mathematical relations so do Architecture
                                       and Town Planning. In other words it must be comprehensible and the reason
                                       for everything done must be clear. In this plan the land axis is made the
                                       garden frontage of the city. At its extremity opposite the peak of Ainslie
                                       is placed the Capital Building each offering and impressive terminal to the
                                       other. Transversely and parallel to the water axis is the retail business
                                       district extending a mile on the level stretch between Mt. Vernon, a low
                                       hill on one side on which are placed the municipal buildings and an equal
                                       eminence to the East where the railroad station is located. Between this and
                                       the water are the Play Grounds of the city of easy access and offering to
                                       the population of the whole city the spectacle or the Government group. At
                                       the western extremity of the water axis at the foot of Black Mountain lies
                                       the University group and at the Eastern is the Military establishment.

                                       and the main Railway Station become the chief centers for radiating avenues
                                       all of them so located as to give fine vistas with marked terminal. These
                                       avenues are all 200' wide, a magnificent system and at the same time a
                                       necessity because of the high speed traffic unknown 50 years ago. This
                                       insures safety for with a double parkway the trams and high speedway in the
                                       center can be somewhat depressed so that crossings can be made with a slight
                                       ramp. This is the system followed in the Railroads. In colder climates the
                                       occasional filling of these trenches with snow is a difficulty but in
                                       Australia there is no difficulty, and the method has the added advantage of
                                       making the tracks very inconspicuous overcoming the ugliness of this feature
                                       which is such an eyesore in most of our communities. The Avenues develop
                                       into business lines as through routes always do and will serve the local
                                       needs of the districts they traverse. It also means that none of the other
                                       streets will undergo the transformation from residence to business so common
                                       and troublesome in many of our cities, for the other streets are all
                                       indirect and a business enterprise located on them would be too greatly
                                       handicapped in its competition with those of easier access. Therefore the
                                       intraradial spaces become strictly domestic, and can develop in quiet and
                                       security counting on the future as securely as the present, the spaces
                                       formed by the obtuse angle in the center of these domestic spaces form a
                                       natural location for a system of small parks increasing in size with the
                                       increased distance from the centers and the consequent decrease in land
                                       values.

                                       for school use for this district is now the business center of the city. If
                                       the schools had retained the ownership of this land the income from it would
                                       be sufficient to support the schools of the whole state. Unfortunately most
                                       of it was sold to individuals who rent it to those who wish to build and the
                                       princely income now goes into the pockets of a handful of individuals who
                                       absorb the community earnings of the whole district.

                                       Mining Colleges lie at the root of Black Mountain which can thus be used as
                                       experiment station. And the Agricultural College expands into the open
                                       fields to the North West.

            <p><a name="d0e12875"></a>Now we shall take up the occupation of the main elements of the city. The
                                       Railroad comes into the main station through a subway of a few blocks in
                                       length which entirely disposes of it as an obstacle and gives it utmost
                                       convenience. Octagonal in shape, it can be used both as a terminal and for
                                       through traffic without conflict of either with the other, thus enabling
                                       trains to be piled up on the terminal tracks for the crowded hours and to
                                       run in onto the through tracks in continuous succession. There can of course
                                       be any number of intermediate stations as along the line and a branch can be
                                       sent in a subway to the Parliament House. With lifts to the street level the
                                       stranger even can immediately determine his way for the Town Hall caps the
                                       hill at the further end of the main business street with the chief retail
                                       stores and down the other avenue is the conspicuous Federal group. About
                                       this center are the markets. The station itself is conspicuous from other
                                       parts of the city. Backed by the Barracks in one direction and by the
                                       cathedral high on the slopes in the other it forms an impressive terminal to
                                       the two avenues which come into it.

                                       South and West. The more industrial groups will develop in the other
                                       directions and the suburban centers will increase indefinitely in these
                                       directions with increasing population. The Railroad yards are placed in the
                                       Northern suburb which natural conditions determine as the industrial
                                       district. The first question of this nature which has come up is the
                                       location of small arms factory. If placed to the East as suggested by the
                                       Works Department the prevailing winds would carry the smoke and odors over

                                       from the East during three seasons, 50% during one season, the windiest
                                       season, and the major portion of the night winds. A crime in any case, the
                                       preciousness of water in Australia would make the location of a factory
                                       along the river bank as suggested such an outrage on the community as it is
                                       hard to conceive any but a private monopoly utterly indifferent to the
                                       welfare of the people considering. We have an instance of the perpetration
                                       of such an outrage in one of the outlying districts of Chicago, where the
                                       Union Steel Works have occupied the whole lake frontage cutting the town of
                                       Gary <a name="343"></a> [Note: Indiana] entirely off from access to the shore and turning
                                       the delightful lake breezes into an ill smelling and filth bearing scourge.
                                       The development of the various districts is worked out in line with the
                                       methods suggested in the early part of this talk. An illustration is the
                                       University residence group in convenient juxtaposition to the grounds on
                                       slopes of the foothills of Black Mountain forming a series of terraces, the
                                       streets following the valleys and the homes on the higher levels. In
                                       addition to the small park system and those in the interior of blocks we
                                       have the great park system and a lovelier one no city can boast. The three
                                       mountains are retained as natural reserves for the preservation of the
                                       native fauna and flora. On Ainslie alone are buildings to be placed,
                                       memorial buildings to commemorate great deeds and great achievements and
                                       always so located and so constructed as to emphasize and not to injure the
                                       natural beauties. At its feet begins the great midway garden. Since all art
                                       depends on proper consideration of terminals the origin of this great way is
                                       marked by the Casino and park accommodation house from which radiate the
                                       paths to the commemoration grounds. From this point the midway extends right
                                       through the city opening up the whole to the Government Group on the slopes.
                                       When it reaches the river it spreads out into the play grounds of the City.

                                       into to form a great stadium which at the same time shall not obstruct the
                                       view across, enclosed by such buildings as library, museum, natural history
                                       building, and at either end on the water's edge the Zoological Garden and
                                       the aviary and natatorium. This Play ground is connected with the other side
                                       of the water by a boulevard which sweeps under the main bridge on the other
                                       forming a high speed promenade commanding but not obstructing the central
                                       district of the city. While the upper and lower of the chain of lakes are
                                       left informal the banks of the lower lake at the University being used for
                                       the Botanical Gardens, the three center lakes have been made formal the
                                       shape of the flood banks making this surprisingly easy requiring almost no
                                       cutting or filling. This formality adds a touch of dignity to the majestic
                                       Federal Group, and offers a mirror for its reflection. The water way is
                                       sufficient for aquatic sports, the center basin being exactly one mile long,
                                       and for pageant in time of festival. The city presents itself as an

                                       the Parliamentary buildings occupying the stage, giving the impression of
                                       one great building like some of the superb structures of Indo-China
                                       presenting a facade one mile in length and piling up terrace on terrace, the
                                       water gate in the center with the judiciary buildings on the lower level
                                       flanking the forum formed by bringing the level of the first terrace out
                                       over the roof of the Water Gate; the next level occupied by various
                                       departmental buildings grouped about a central court with its pool giving a
                                       stately and charming out door resort to the members of the government.
                                       Terminating the court is the Parliament House set on a level 40 feet above
                                       that of the court at its feet. This whole garden frontage of the main
                                       buildings of the city starting with the peak of Ainslie to the North is
                                       terminated by the Capitol building itself on the top of Kurrajong some 60

                                       ultimate can be attained only when the railroads (all continental
                                       communication) have been taken out of the hands of the government. Since the
                                       voters are all, practically, in the coastal cities it is thumbs down to any
                                       politician who suggests spending tax money on any other extensions. The
                                       bureaucracy gets its revenge by placing the railroads in the wrong place
                                       each time &#8212; climbing high over mountains though better grades are evident as
                                       the wagon routes show. When that becomes obvious to too many they rebuild at
                                       a better grade still reserving better ones for a later time.

                                       Port Stephens has sea level entrance to the interior of the continent. It is
                                       in close contact with vital mineral supplies and Newcastle is an already
                                       established industrial center near by.

                                       this district between Sydney and Brisbane and they purchased this strategic
                                       promontory. He designed the city. It was surveyed, the allotments staked out
                                       and the whole was sold from the plan in the Sydney real estate office. This
                                       meant contour surveys were made in the course of which he became personally

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13003"></a>Just as the beauties of the Haven Valley are common to all the Australian
                                       coasts, the flats above on this continental plateau may well serve for all
                                       sorts of intense occupation, but the unique beauty of the foreshores, their
                                       valleys and promontories, should be preserved for all time and residential
                                       occupancy can use them but need not destroy any of their beauty. Thus
                                       charming and spectacular sites for dwellings are to be found all along the
                                       coasts. The flats above them sometimes extend to mountain valleys of equally
                                       strange and unique charms. The blueness of the Blue Mountains can be
                                       explained I think only by supersensible knowledge for in this land where we
                                       find the Paradise people, and the pre-solid vegetation recorded in the now
                                       material forms of nature, so in the blueness or these valleys we find the
                                       pre-liquid conditions visible to the ordinary eye though no material name
                                       can express it. For the blueness that fills the valleys is no mist. It can
                                       be explained as the manifestation without materialization of the 3rd of the
                                       4 Ethers &#8212; the chemical Ether which manifests materially as water.

            <p><a name="d0e13006"></a>Let us face the future of Port Stephens as the New York of Australia and look
                                       at the spectacle of a city completely beautiful, correct in its location, in
                                       its design and in its solution of its various types of buildings. There is
                                       no reason why the earliest buildings as well as the later ones should not be
                                       correct and correctly placed and all beautiful for as we have seen in our
                                       preceding studies beauty is not an expense but calls simply for the
                                       expenditure of mind and spirit which are not depleted by use but the
                                       contrary. In other words it calls for the use of human faculties &#8212; thinking,
                                       feeling and will (doing). Along the foreshore reserves would appear
                                       dwellings for nothing but artificial land values caused by private ownership
                                       of land would keep people from homing in the midst of such beauty. Town
                                       Planning includes a Zoning system.

            <p><a name="d0e13022"></a>Port Stephens is an illustration of what the Military department of the
                                       bureaucracy can do with the interests of a nation. On arrival in Australia,
                                       Burley Griffin immediately made the continent of Australia his concern and
                                       found that the Western coast had two natural seaports. Eastern United States
                                       has but one which has made New York city the inevitable seaport of the
                                       Atlantic coast and the important city that it is.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13025"></a>At each of these points there is a splendid harbor and a sea-level entrance
                                       to the interior of the continent. In his innocence he interested a client,
                                       who was carrying on a considerable real estate business, in the opportunity
                                       offered at Port Stephens which must become the seaport of New South Wales,
                                       for Sydney which has a fine harbor has to transport all goods going in or
                                       coming out over the mountains. If the railroads had not been nationally

                                       the Port Stephens district not only has these primary necessities for a
                                       seaport but is surrounded by a district rich in a great variety of natural
                                       resources &#8212; coal, iron, and so on, as well as the magnificent agricultural
                                       resources of the district back of it. But National ownership gives the
                                       cities control of the politicians and officials through their preponderating
                                       vote so Sydney has been able to maintain its interests versus the interests
                                       of the continent.

                                       His client bought this land, a magnificent promontory on this a finer harbor

                                       military purposes. This destructive power won in the conflict of interests
                                       over the constructive interests of a continent. Griffin had expected to take

                                       opportunity, a harbor with a sea level entrance in Victoria. But since Port

                                       following? Who was the chief economic rival of Britain? I think that no one
                                       will deny that it was the United States. Then what power could Britain bring
                                       into war, for no matter with whom it was Britain could secretly or openly
                                       back this opponent of the United States.

                                       Dominions the habit of hatred was directed against America and before the
                                       war was over it was far stronger, at least in Australia, and more bitter
                                       than the hatred of the Germans. Then the Japanese began to work up a case
                                       against the United States regarding the treatment of her citizens. Here was
                                       a chance and a secret understanding could be entered into. The idea of
                                       Japan's initiating a war against the United States was, on the surface, an
                                       absurdity but Japan was piling up war supplies, etc. No absurdity if she had

            <p><a name="d0e13070"></a>The next thing cooked up was the attack of Japan on China. America's sympathy
                                       for China was well known. Of course America's treatment of the indemnities
                                       after the Boxer Rebellion was an affront to all the imperialisms of Europe.
                                       (We must remember that all Parliamentary governments are imperialisms.
                                       Officialdom controls affairs as versus the people.) If only America could be
                                       caught in any warlike act the trick would be turned and another World War
                                       would be on. America's naval vessels were hanging around. Hoover's personal
                                       (mining) interests coincided with Britain's, but fortunately the cabinet got
                                       wind of the situation and gathered in the middle of the night to confer with
                                       the president and insisted that a wireless be sent to the navy not under any
                                       circumstances to fire a shot no matter what the provocation. So America kept
                                       out and the Chinese drove the Japanese out. In that first attack China won.
                                       So Japan backed by Britain, secretly of course, started the war on China. It
                                       is nonsense to think Japan would have done this if she hadn't known England
                                       wouldn't object. But again America was a disappointment. She took no overt
                                       act to support China so another good chance for a World War and the
                                       gathering of the clans to "Maintain the Balance of Power" was lost.

            <p><a name="d0e13073"></a>So then what? Well then the whisperings with Germany began. To be sure
                                       Germany had a good many grouches and couldn't be handled quite so easily and
                                       brought about a good many complications but yet the main thing was being
                                       accomplished. A revived Germany was a threat to Britain if she went into
                                       India. So she makes an agreement with her that she can have all central and
                                       Eastern Europe if she will keep out of India. So the imperial game goes on
                                       with endless twists and turns. Germany was again

                                       maintain Equity. Since moral standards vary in the various communities this
                                       will be the slowest to function well: an Economic Organ to attain Mutual
                                       Advantage in production and exchange. This should be easy to get functioning
                                       swiftly since it is already a fact though not consciously organized: and a
                                       Social Organ to enable every human being to develop his Abilities to the

                                       effort, a certain amount of human accomplishment largely attributed to
                                       inspiration and a consequent vanity in those supposed to be inspired, and
                                       hero worship by the rest, a large amount of imitation on the part of others
                                       but no steady progression in the field till finally the underlying
                                       principles begin to become apparent, the laws are investigated, the whole is
                                       brought within the scope of the intelligence. Then the accomplishments in
                                       this particular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with
                                       amazement at the results.

            <p><a name="d0e13106"></a>We have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of
                                       development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but
                                       the development of this wonderful field was very limited till the law &#8212; a
                                       purely mathematical one &#8212; of the conservation of rhythm &#8212; was understood.
                                       When we learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves
                                       with each other and the consequent destruction of sound and that the sounds
                                       we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each other so
                                       that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a development of the
                                       art of music which is one of the miracles of the present time. A hundred
                                       years has done what all the thousand of years proceeding did not begin to
                                       do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learn this
                                       fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the controlling
                                       law.

                                       destruction is painful to us but evidence of continuity is a joy and
                                       inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law.
                                       Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made
                                       conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elements in our present
                                       creation, and in being made aware of infinity through the preservation of
                                       rhythm, so in architecture and landscape architecture which are but

                                       space units we use reinforce each other and a feeling of spaciousness is
                                       obtained. In a building or in a community a huddle and clutter of unrelated
                                       units is as distressing as a harsh sound.

            <p><a name="d0e13120"></a>Let us illustrate this principle so simple yet so vital capable of so many
                                       and so varied results. The first problem in this field is that of the
                                       smallest unit in our life of to-day, one family. We take it in its simplest
                                       distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and
                                       conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its
                                       industrial development to provide effective shelter and comfortable living,
                                       though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use
                                       utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we
                                       are making or the conservation of space. Every family requires provision for
                                       the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the
                                       bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any
                                       other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom.
                                       Similarly the working quarters should be isolated, and so concentrated as to
                                       save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in
                                       closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private
                                       needs the quarters to be used in common should be so arranged as to help
                                       each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving
                                       feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary
                                       we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that
                                       would be required for a small living room and a small dining room as one
                                       room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is
                                       empty and vice versa. With a little more leeway putting the two rooms
                                       together in the form of an L adds a little bit of mystery. With a house a
                                       bit larger a half story level scheme gives opportunity for a large living
                                       room with high ceiling which its greater proportions prevent being
                                       inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library opening out from the
                                       higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these rooms

            <p><a name="d0e13128"></a>and a delightful feeling of openness to the whole. This arrangement is very
                                       economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages of
                                       both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation in
                                       the heights of the ceilings of rooms of various sizes eliminating the
                                       unpleasant proportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same
                                       level from large rooms to small rooms and at the same time getting the
                                       feeling of openness and distance, and in addition an emphasis as pleasing in
                                       building as in any art.

            <p><a name="d0e13131"></a>From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two
                                       families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work
                                       together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by
                                       intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one
                                       of the streets of Evanston <a name="349"></a> [Note: Illinois] where the lots and houses
                                       of approximately the same size are all placed each the same distance from
                                       the other, the only idea being to get the most out of one's own lot no
                                       matter what the consequences to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look
                                       crowded and cramped for yard space, till we come to two houses (Comstock
                                       Houses) that were built at the same time with the intention of making a bit
                                       of music, instead of adding to the noise. Here in spite of the fact that the
                                       size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that there is
                                       ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses have
                                       thrown their open space together, and have located themselves on the further
                                       sides of their respective lots. This means of course that an architectural
                                       problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house may have
                                       equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about this if one is
                                       but willing to take the pains. It means of course that the one house cannot
                                       as a rule be a duplicate of the other. With this arrangement each house has
                                       an open space to look out, twice the size of what it has with the other
                                       method. The manner of solving this problem varies with the size of the lots,
                                       and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there is always an
                                       advantage to be gained by working together.

                                       wives and children, wanted cottages for their summer outings, and decided to
                                       build on this charmingly picturesque bit or woodland. Each family by this
                                       arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be built so as to destroy as
                                       little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to get as great a view as
                                       possible of the river with trails leading to each cabin from the large
                                       building nearer the main road which serves for accommodation house and
                                       entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is the common garage and
                                       caretaker's home in connection with which is the farm for raising
                                       vegetables, fruit, etc. for the whole group.

                                       bring service portions together making it possible to emphasize the

                                       illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing
                                       together of sounds does not consummate the making of music, so in Town
                                       Planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as
                                       anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have
                                       all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and the
                                       law of conservation of space observed as in music the sound wave must be
                                       conserved. Some illustrations will make this point clear.

                                       similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of
                                       course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more

                                       tract of land about 1500' by 2000' on the outskirts of Chicago, and was
                                       better than the usual layout of that region in one respect. It had left the
                                       usual depth of block the same but had omitted the alley so unnecessary in a
                                       residence district, throwing that extra space into the yards. It was the
                                       intention to build two family apartments on all the 50 foot lots and they
                                       were placed uniformly as is the common custom. Realizing the great
                                       importance of interior parks in districts so closely occupied we started out
                                       to do that much. Instead of running the street through on the long side it
                                       was taken transversely across and a short street brought into it. We had a
                                       four acre park. The next question was - How many lots had we. On counting we
                                       found we had exactly the same number of lots of the same depth and width as
                                       in the other arrangement. Since the streets on either side of the property
                                       were ample for through traffic added seclusion was given by this arrangement
                                       and while keeping the width between building lines the same, the pavements
                                       of the streets could be reduced, decreasing expense and adding to park-like
                                       appearance.

            <p><a name="d0e13174"></a>By a grant of 50 feet from each private lot leaving it still one hundred feet
                                       in depth an interior park of one acre was obtained in each of the smaller
                                       blocks and a 5 acre park in the larger, ample for sports for the children
                                       and young people of the whole neighborhood, and by using one lot for common
                                       a neighborhood club can be built. Indeed the increased value given to all
                                       the lots by this arrangement would probably build a comfortable club house.

                                       space for sports in the interior of the block and this space can be used for
                                       purely park purposes or for gardening. The maximum feeling of openness is
                                       given by grouping one-family fireproof houses in pairs with the service

                                       but also with relation to the group on the opposite side of the street. Care
                                       is also taken in the grouping of these pairs to give picturesqueness and
                                       varying interest, uniting some with low concrete walls to give a feeling of

                                       at Grinnell <a name="354"></a> [Note: Iowa] where the somewhat rolling ground of the town
                                       as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking
                                       illustration of the impractical nature of these so called practical ways of
                                       doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues,
                                       fails to see beyond its nose and, curiously enough, fails in consequence to
                                       accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact
                                       that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the
                                       parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having
                                       decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives
                                       him best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the

                                       it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the pipes for the
                                       higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or there would be

                                       technical man for solution. By making the streets follow the bottom of the
                                       ravines these difficulties and extravagances were entirely overcome. By
                                       recognition of the nature of the location which made it essentially and
                                       permanently a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide
                                       pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that
                                       instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66 that
                                       is 9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the
                                       average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there
                                       was an increase of 30% in the saleable frontage, which, taking the prices
                                       previously set increased the profits of the sale by &pound;3,000
                                       <a name="355"></a> [Note: $3,000?]. In addition all the houses were located on the higher
                                       land, none in the hole and the whole took on the look of a park, and became
                                       in consequence the most attractive residence district in the town.

                                       desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first
                                       ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they were laying
                                       out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with
                                       cross streets necessitating steep gardens in numerous cases and with no park
                                       space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated, even if the
                                       profits are to be increased but again that was not the case.

                                       of the gross streets became entirely unnecessary, easy gradients were
                                       obtained everywhere, the depths of the blocks were increased till almost
                                       without exception all the blocks had interior parks, while at the same time
                                       the private allotments were increased from 130' to 150' in depth, and when
                                       the count of lots was made there were still as many as before. So naturally
                                       the client would have no objection to the advantages to be offered to

                                       appointed a medical officer whom he knew personally over the heads of a

                                       when we were in the United States we might easily have had your point of
                                       view in this matter, but we feel that our experience here has opened our
                                       eyes to what we consider is the greatest menace to democracy threatening the

                                       of a bureaucracy, in other words of Civil Service, and is quite as true of
                                       it in France (concerning which there was an illuminating article in one of

                                       may be. An analysis of the system will show how inevitably an organization
                                       of permanent officials must develop into a tyrannical, inefficient organ,
                                       just as in the case of placing any individual in complete irresponsible

                                       President is responsible for. The assumption that men who have been in
                                       office longer are quite as efficient as the new comers is not only without
                                       any rational foundation but is almost necessarily the contrary of the fact.
                                       This is apparent in every department in which we have had the opportunity to
                                       observe and is a point on which we have gained much information. It is the

            <p><a name="d0e13336"></a>There is, of course, no reason why a permanent official should not react to
                                       his circumstances in exactly the same way that any autocrat does and, in
                                       communities where the Service has been perfected, I assure you they do so
                                       react promptly and effectively.

                                       of a Permanent Civil Service organization, for in the Spoils System an
                                       individual who temperamentally is inclined to be active and efficient can
                                       act in accordance with his impulse. Not so in the Civil Service, since the
                                       case and security of his superior officers is best promoted by inefficiency
                                       and ignorance in the men about him. Moreover inefficiency makes it easier to
                                       increase the numbers in the Service which increases the power of the
                                       organization by its command of votes.

            <p><a name="d0e13342"></a>In our experience, one of the Ministers who was inclined to oppose the
                                       inefficiencies of Civil Service was told by the head of one of the
                                       Departments that if he did so they would drive him out of Parliament at the
                                       next election which was then pending. They have, of course, a powerful
                                       publicity organization, constantly using the news papers, and with unlimited
                                       funds in the taxes collected. This power means that the nominal responsible
                                       agents of the people, the Members of Parliament and the Ministers have, in
                                       fact, no power at all for when, as of course sometimes happens, an
                                       individual man refuses to be intimidated he is shortly driven out of office.
                                       The work is systematically obstructed during his term of office and stopped

                                       soon as that individual is out of office. As the head of one of the
                                       Departments told one such officer according to evidence sworn to in the
                                       Royal Commission which has recently been investigating the methods of the
                                       officials in connection with the Federal Capital, - "The Minister and Mr.

            <p><a name="d0e13366"></a>That these officials snap their fingers at any attempt to interfere with them
                                       is constantly shown as it was recently when the Chief Justice in a Royal
                                       Commission exposed the outrageous management of one of the Military camps
                                       and commended another. The man who was commended was demoted by his
                                       superiors in the Department and transferred to a distant and unpleasant
                                       location, while the one who was condemned was promoted with an increase of
                                       salary.

            <p><a name="d0e13369"></a>That such must be the consequence of such a system is apparent when we
                                       consider that the organization is self-contained, feeding itself only from
                                       the youngest members of the community since no one is allowed to enter the
                                       permanent service after he is 21 years of age, which thus precludes the
                                       possibility of its containing men of education and experience; that their
                                       positions are permanent; that no one outside of the Service can promote or
                                       demote or dismiss any member of it, for the process of dismissal can be
                                       accomplished only by a jury of themselves which, naturally, never dismisses
                                       a man, thus safeguarding themselves for future emergencies. For instance,
                                       one Prime Minister of Australia recently, new to his office, discharged his

                                       that in this incident of the Federal Capital some 5 million dollars has been
                                       spent by the Department officials which has not accomplished anything of
                                       permanent benefit, a large part of which has produced no results whatever
                                       that any investigation can discover. The Commissioner investigating the
                                       Federal Capital finds the Ministers utterly powerless through the fact that
                                       they are either kept in ignorance of expenditures or their instructions are
                                       ignored. To quote from the Commissioner's report:- "As to finances at
                                       Canberra, the evidence discloses that there never has been efficient
                                       Parliamentary or Ministerial control and that moneys have been expended by
                                       the officers without the authority or knowledge of the Minister and without
                                       any proper revision by the officers of the Auditor-General's Department."

                                       universally apparent in the United States is because it is so recent that it

            <p><a name="d0e13443"></a>The menace of this institution lies in the fact that it is an autocracy of so
                                       large a body that it is in the nature of the control of a minority by a
                                       majority which is naturally much more difficult to overthrow than when the
                                       reverse is the case. A man who had spent some 7 years in Russia and, while
                                       there, thought no other people could be so under the heel of a Bureaucracy
                                       found, after the same length of time spent in Australia, that the
                                       Bureaucracy was exactly as powerful here. A quotation from one of today's
                                       papers offers an illustration of what I mean by that - when we realize that
                                       no matter what exposures are made no remedies are forthcoming: -
                                       "Revelations of the methods of the Defense Department (one of the
                                       Bureaucratic Departments of course) made during the trial of the defending
                                       military officer in Sydney were of the most disquieting kind. In the earlier
                                       stages of the war, when ordinary business precautions were sacrificed to
                                       haste, allowance was made for chaos in the Department. But the remark of
                                       Judge Scholes who presided showed clearly that a condition of inexcusable
                                       muddle was permitted to continue. It was disclosed in evidence amongst other
                                       things that sixty thousand pounds (&pound;60,000) was passed through the
                                       Department for payments to a corps that had long been demobilized. The
                                       Defense Department was frequently warned of the hopeless drifting in its
                                       financial administration, but the only response to criticism was an
                                       assurance in superior tones that all possible safeguards were being adopted.
                                       At Victoria Barracks, Sydney, even the most elementary precautions were not
                                       taken. The unhappy results there do not of course imply dishonesty elsewhere
                                       but are strong presumptive evidence of deplorably slipshod methods
                                       throughout the Department."

            <p><a name="d0e13446"></a>I will quote another newspaper:- "Everywhere the Australian citizen may look
                                       he sees himself surrounded by evidence that the direction of national
                                       affairs is in the hands of messers and that, whether it be building a city
                                       or running a war or a post office, muddle reigns supreme. In this particular

                                       treated. But his vast capacity for wasting money and making a mess mattered
                                       so little that when <a name="365"></a> [Note: William Morris] Hughes formed his Rump

                                       Customs - a job only second in importance to that of Defense Minister." But
                                       the important thing to note is the succeeding sentence:- "Is the public <u>never</u> going to wake up and insist upon at least decent
                                       administration? Or is it simply going on approving of politicians who
                                       plainly say that administration doesn't matter?"
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13466"></a>The politicians are blamed whereas there have been Ministers who have
                                       strained every nerve to administer efficiently but for whom it was
                                       impossible there being no way except to break the law - the Civil Service
                                       law - and that would by no means be effective unless supported by the
                                       people, which it wouldn't be.

                                       individual adopts a method similar to the Civil Service. He will first
                                       choose an agent but after this he will not be able to dismiss nor demote nor
                                       decrease the salary of this or any of the subagents whom his chief agent has
                                       employed. Not only will all the profits of his business go directly into the
                                       hands of his agent except what is barely necessary for his own living
                                       expenses, and perhaps without that exception, but all the income of his
                                       other business, investments and inheritances will go directly into the hands
                                       of this agent so that if the business is not kept running on a profitable
                                       basis it can be supported by these outside sources of income.

            <p><a name="d0e13475"></a>How satisfactory would such an arrangement be even during the lifetime of the
                                       agent chosen by the business man and how satisfactory in the hands of his
                                       successors. Very satisfactory to the agent, of course, and it is he who
                                       would be Kow-towed to by the community.

            <p><a name="d0e13510"></a>It is indeed important for us to begin to think internationally, and to
                                       observe most carefully the results of systems that have been put into
                                       practice. For instance, you would not be an advocate of the Single Tax
                                       System if you were here in Australia. Our experience has warned us that the
                                       Single Tax, adopted by any community under autocratic control, even if it is
                                       nominally a democracy, is but the most efficient instrument for
                                       impoverishing the people. The things these communities need to work for is
                                       not single Tax but for abolition of Bureaucracy and for Popular Control. And
                                       in the United States if Single Tax is adopted and the Civil Service left to
                                       perfect itself, a generation or two will suffice to put the United States
                                       exactly where the countries of Europe are now and bid fair to remain for a
                                       long time to come.

                                       countries as well as to Australia, have no power whatever except that of
                                       apportioning and collecting the taxes. These funds are expended only by the
                                       Civil Service Bureaucracy. The Bureaucracy is the aristocracy which,
                                       hitherto, has worked very quietly, leaving the politicians to get what glory
                                       they may from conspicuousness and to take all the blame of any evils evident
                                       in affairs. The present situation, however, is enabling them to come out of
                                       their hiding, for the demand of the people for Socialism which means putting
                                       into the hands of the Government, necessarily therefore into the hands of
                                       the Bureaucracy, all the businesses of the community, is a system which has
                                       now been accepted by the established aristocracies who, already largely
                                       bureaucrats, have seen that by this method they can perfect their powers.

                                       analysis of the proper function of government. The human being has two
                                       functions to fulfill, that of an individual, and that of a unit in a
                                       community. As individual, his duty and his right is to watch out for his own
                                       interests. As a Citizen, it is his duty and privilege to see to it that all
                                       other individuals have equal opportunity to look out for their interests.
                                       This means that the function of Government is the maintenance of justice,
                                       and only that. All other undertakings are matters for the individual, which
                                       he can carry on either by himself or in combination to any extent, even to
                                       that of the whole membership of his community. But always outside of this
                                       should be the governing machinery which should form no part of the other
                                       activities of the community.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13527"></a>For instance, in the question of Single Tax, the Government should go no
                                       further than seeing to it that this common property of the community should
                                       be enjoyed by all equally, that is it could properly collect the rental
                                       values of land but, after paying out of this sum the necessary expenses of
                                       its own machinery, the rest should not be used by this organization for
                                       expenditure for any other purposes whatever but should be divided up among
                                       the individuals who, individually or in groups, could then expend it
                                       according to their wishes. To unite the profit making machinery with the
                                       justice maintaining machinery will cripple or destroy justice in the future
                                       as it has always in the past.

                                       are organized for the <u>benefit</u> of the citizens, has no
                                       basis of justice and consequently no element of democracy. And you will

                                       wake up and look for them. The recent case of the building of boats by the
                                       Navy Department is typical, the officials spending $80,000,000 recently
                                       building the same old boats according to their routine, indifferent to the
                                       recently formed necessity of armoring them below the water line because of
                                       submarines; introducing expensive new toys in the way of electrical devices
                                       where it happens to please their fancy in spite of the fact that they offer
                                       no advantage while tremendously increasing cost, neither extravagance nor
                                       efficiency being elements that the Civil Service need to take into account
                                       at all.

                                       the Bureaucracy. If it is merely an ousting of individual members, no more
                                       is gained than by the killing of a land owner when his son, or anyone else,
                                       inherits his property. Unfortunately there are few in Europe who think they
                                       believe in democracy who are not in fact believers in Socialism - the very
                                       antithesis of democracy - the strongest of all forms of aristocracy, and
                                       necessarily Bureaucratic for business cannot be run without an organ to run
                                       it.

                                       pernicious is the custom of giving titles. It is like a rot in the heart of
                                       an apple. The abolition of military titles would be a great help in the
                                       control of the military pending its entire abolition. It would puncture much
                                       of the element of vanity and consequently much of its appeal to those who
                                       are looking, not to render service, but to gain glory. One has to live in a

                                       times only because they pay, yet few cities in the world ever had the
                                       prospects of this first and only capital of a continent. Melbourne and
                                       Sydney pay handsomely but merely to a single land-holding class. Canberra on
                                       the contrary with no land-holding class will be profitable to the whole

                                       the middle ages controlled their own land have no need to levy rates or
                                       taxes to pay their way and many of these towns have been paying annual

                                       cities pay the least in proportion to their population because the highest
                                       values accrue to the lands serving the economically higher classes of
                                       residential communities. None of the great Capitals of the Continent of
                                       Europe - Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow - possess preponderant

                                       loosen a little the strangle-hold of the metropolitan capitals which are

                                       their fair share of legislative interest and assistance so long as the
                                       propinquity of the great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the

                                       4,500 official employees to be transferred forthwith. As a matter of fact
                                       the latest Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner's Staff List shows 2,898
                                       permanent employees a year ago on the Central Staffs to which must be added
                                       also the Parliamentary, Railway and Repatriation, Naval and Military
                                       permanent Central Staffs outside the Commission, amounting to 600 more and
                                       no less than 1,000 temporary employees in all branches; altogether 5,500.
                                       And the employment during ten years has been increasing over 10 per cent per
                                       annum. The average pay of these Commonwealth Servants is &pound;200 per year
                                       whereas the average income of wage earners generally is only &pound;172&#8211;13&#8211;8.

                                       the assessment valuations of the Cities of Canada confirm these figures. He
                                       states moreover, that in some Western Cities the assessed value of the land
                                       alone is &pound;400 per capita and a particular city of 15,000 population is
                                       referred to showing &pound;270.

                                       declarations in the Australian "Wealth" Census of 1915 was &pound;92 per capita
                                       but that may be considered about half the true value as may be seen by

                                       independently of the land. In fact in the successful garden city of
                                       Letchworth, England, with 13,000 population these services bring twice as

                                       decided to keep the bond and honor the contract on which the proposition was
                                       really based and go on with the project on business lines.

                                       of work, two thirds unskilled, that the average man could take up. The
                                       Government has been forced to find thousands of houses for these men and
                                       their families and by this demand has much increased the cost of building in
                                       the metropolitan cities, whereas large idle brickworks, millions of bricks,
                                       extensive stores of timber, cement, and building plant have been waiting the

                                       building industry in Australia. If five thousand houses are erected in
                                       Canberra they will relieve to that extent the national shortage of twenty
                                       thousand houses, without adding to the government's responsibility or in any
                                       way upsetting the real estate or building market. If this work was left

                                       site was chosen and announced in the public press. During this decade a

                                       to undertake the planning since there were no Town Planners in the modern
                                       world. And, mirabile dictu, toward the end of the decade the announcement
                                       came - an International Competition for the Capital City.

            <p><a name="d0e13830"></a>Australia, not having attained unification through a revolution, had adopted
                                       the routine type of government, the parliamentary, which puts the
                                       politicians in the bag of the Bureaucracy instead of vice versa as in the
                                       case of the United States thanks to the great genius of the creators of the
                                       Congressional form and to <a name="377"></a> [Note: President] Andrew Jackson. In the
                                       United States the elected government can, if it will, dismiss a civil
                                       servant. Elsewhere the civil Servants can throw out the government whenever
                                       it wants to. In the battle of Canberra this fact must be understood. It was
                                       the fight of a single man against, well against on empire if one states it

                                       without this man who advised him when he arrived in Australia to return to
                                       the United States. Mr. Smith was not a traitor but a remodeler of Empire, a
                                       house-cleaner so to speak. Real power if it is not perverted to the
                                       advantage of the individual lies in the individual man.

            <p><a name="d0e13844"></a>Mr. Smith got this wild Irishman, Mr. O'Malley, to publish the terms of the
                                       competition. The Labor Party was thrown out of office in consequence but the
                                       announcement was out. (Later Smith got the assistant Prime Minister of the
                                       other Party to advise the Prime Minister to appoint Griffin as Director of
                                       Design and Construction of the Federal Capital. Whereupon the Liberal Party
                                       was thrown out. So the fight went on.)

            <p><a name="d0e13847"></a>In the mean time the adjudicators had been selected. They were to be chosen
                                       by their official organizations - one by the surveyors, one by the
                                       engineers, one by the architects. Mr. Smith was chosen by the
                                       engineering-institute. The architects under pressure from "home" refused to
                                       nominate one so the Minister, Mr. O'Malley, appointed one. However
                                       Australian architects entered the competition but not the English. They
                                       bided their time but this time it never came.

            <p><a name="d0e13850"></a>Plans were sent from all around the world. The adjudication went to W.B.
                                       Griffin by a 2 to 1 vote - Mr. Smith and the Architect appointed by the
                                       Minister. The third voted for an Australian plan. At the official handing of
                                       the envelope containing the number of the winning plan to the Minister of
                                       Home Affairs by the head official of this department with the photographers
                                       around to record this event, Mr. Smith called his attention to the fact that
                                       he was delivering the wrong envelope, the correct one was in his left hand
                                       pocket. At that moment the cameras clicked. It made an interesting
                                       photograph but the correct one was handed to the Minister. I am telling this
                                       story at this late date because it is critically important now in 1947 that
                                       Americans should comprehend the difference between the Parliamentary and the
                                       Congressional forms of government. Except in the United States and

                                       British history contains only one other case of a Royal Commission going
                                       against the officials.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13864"></a>Meantime the Labor Party was again thrown out because officialdom can always
                                       influence enough votes to throw out a party non-grata to itself. You see
                                       Permanent Officialdom has the spending of all the money and has the
                                       selecting of Temporary officials. This is one of the essential differences
                                       between the Parliamentary form of government and the Congressional, that
                                       great work of creative genius of the founders of America. Another is that
                                       the Parliamentary cabinet Ministers are legislators without economic or
                                       executive experience so dependent on the officials in government
                                       undertakings. At least a number of American Presidents have had considerable
                                       executive experience. The result is that in America 6 percent of the
                                       population of the world consumes 60 percent of the products of the world.
                                       You see people are all right all around the world if you give them a chance.
                                       The British people are lovely on the whole like all other people but their
                                       form of government is the masterpiece of Satan himself. The consequences
                                       will be dire if after the war the institutions of the world are modeled on
                                       this pattern.

            <p><a name="d0e13867"></a>The first thing Mr. Smith did when they began the study of the plans was to
                                       have the presentation drawings Griffin had sent in photographed so that they
                                       should not be seduced by their beauty. These drawings by the way were made
                                       by myself. So they were tucked away among the archives. The second prize
                                       went to Mr. <a name="379"></a> [Note: Eliel] Saarinen of Finland and they were beautiful
                                       too but these two designs represented two different schools. Saarinen
                                       imposed his concept on nature, cutting, terracing, formalizing the district
                                       on traditional lines. Griffin touched Australia's native beauty with loving
                                       hands. The plan, as an Australian writer puts it, "fits the location like a
                                       glove." None of its beauty has been attained at the expense of nature. It is
                                       a majestic union of classic and romantic. The judge found that every
                                       function of the Capital City was located where it was to its best advantage.
                                       As a Scotchman wrote Griffin after the adjudication, "It is the only
                                       comprehensible city plan I have ever seen."
            </p>

            <p><a name="d0e13878"></a>Mr. Smith went over it with a fine tooth comb as he did all the plans. The
                                       decision was given to Griffin because it was correct, every need of a city
                                       met, every function fulfilled and every organ located where it should be in
                                       relation to others and where nature would best serve it and enhance it.
                                       However the judges had no say in deciding who should have charge of carrying
                                       the design into effect.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13881"></a>With the unification of the continent the rivalry between individuals for
                                       control of the land rents became a rivalry of the States for the location of
                                       the government within its boundaries for that meant the housing of
                                       officialdom and the continual rise of land values. Victoria won out in the
                                       first place but only after it had been written into the constitution that a
                                       new city should be built. The bargain was that Melbourne should house it for
                                       the first decade but that the city should be built in New South Wales only
                                       about 100 miles from Sydney, within one might say not excessive commutation
                                       distance from Sydney at any rate for the members of Parliament. It took a
                                       decade more for Canberra to grow attractive for New South Wales members to
                                       take residence in Canberra.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13884"></a>The proper method would have been for the city planner to determine its
                                       location but at that time there was no such thing as a city planner. When
                                       Griffin went to Australia he did locate and design the port and capital for
                                       the new state of Northern New South Wales when the time comes for that
                                       division and he also pointed out the proper place for a transcontinental
                                       port in Victoria. Had he been consulted he would have located Canberra more
                                       nearly in the center of Australia, in the McDonald Ranges, safer from the
                                       military point of view, a charming location and one that would help to
                                       develop Australia continentally. The government controlled railroads have
                                       kept Australia from developing continentally as the U.S. did under private
                                       ownership for no politician would vote against the wishes of his
                                       constituents who objected to having remote Railroads built out of their tax
                                       money. If it were not for obstructions from outside its borders there is no
                                       reason why Australia

                                       interests instead of on continental political and economic lines. A district
                                       to serve in Australia as the District of Columbia in the United States but

                                       property in the district instead being just one subdivision of the Nation.
                                       This would of course prevent private citizens from reaping the fruit of
                                       rising land values in the district. It also prevented in Canberra what
                                       happened in Washington - the perversion of the business district where in
                                       Washington the high prices charged by current owners diverted the whole
                                       business district from its proper location, deadly to the perfection of the
                                       development of the city.

            <p><a name="d0e13898"></a>Of course the right answer is to have no State lines. States are just
                                       hangovers of old jealousies which have no meaning now, and consequently act
                                       as diseases in the community. Tariffs are already being set up on those
                                       lines in the U.S. There are just two natural government entities - the
                                       continent and the city. Their nature is different and calls for different
                                       types of government. The intermediate state has no proper function.

                                       its suburbs of Canberra has made possible the orderly development of the

            <p><a name="d0e13904"></a>The first thing Griffin did in Australia was to check the roads, then
                                       thoroughfares, of the suburban districts to make them connect most directly
                                       and economically with the neighboring towns. A curious thing happened
                                       however for Griffin's design is not only for the central city, the area of
                                       which was specified in the conditions of competition, but includes the
                                       surrounding suburbs. The more or less frequent changes of party control and
                                       thus of ministers led each new Minister of Home Affairs to

                                       the other suburbs as shown in the approved plan so that from quite early
                                       days one could climb one or another of the hill slopes and look out upon a
                                       whole city with all its suburbs laid out on the ground and occupied to a
                                       certain extent while the population was still very small. Naturally there
                                       are in consequence some complaints about distances. This premature
                                       expenditure was really no extra expense since the government has to pay
                                       neither rent nor interest on money spent and it and its consequences have
                                       had a very remarkable effect on Australia. It means that while still very
                                       young Canberra has become a great show not only for travelers from afar but
                                       for the citizenry (even though there still remained different gauges in the
                                       railroads of the states) and it has to a considerable extent broken down the
                                       state jealousies. Australia now thinks as a unit as has been evidenced by

                                       imperial barriers in a way that was impossible at the time of the last war.
                                       Of course London foresaw that, which accounts for the opposition to the
                                       competition for the capital city, and previously to the capital city at all.

            <p><a name="d0e13921"></a>After Griffin's death, a few days before I left Australia, I went with a
                                       friend, a newspaper man, to have a farewell look at Canberra. Now in the
                                       early days practically no one wanted Canberra. It meant financial loss to
                                       both the big cities, Sydney and Melbourne, because the large and ever
                                       growing Civil Service would move away and all their business with them.
                                       Their rents and their purchases would be lost. So land owners and business,
                                       sellers and buyers, helped officialdom - that is the whole citizenry -
                                       helped to put obstacles in the way of progress of the Capital. But Griffin
                                       always felt that "the people" really wanted it, really needed it and the
                                       flame of his enthusiasm backed by the determination of Mr. Smith kept it
                                       keeping on. He knew the people of Australia needed it and would awaken to
                                       the need.

            <p><a name="d0e13929"></a>This is what happened on a farewell visit I made with Mr. Trinick. We both
                                       went incognito. After jaunting around and seeing the sights we stopped in a
                                       shop. Casually Mr. Trinick said to a clerk, "Well we tourists think Canberra
                                       is a pretty nice place, but I suppose you people who live here don't feel
                                       that way about it." "We certainly do like it very much," said the young man.
                                       "Well," said Mr. Trinick, "I asked a man who it was that designed Canberra
                                       and he did not know." The youth flared, "There is not anyone in Canberra who
                                       does not know that Mr. Burley Griffin designed Canberra. They feel that
                                       through his great inspiration the soul of Australia is being developed."
                                       That was a nice farewell for me his wife and I realized that the old bitter
                                       fight was over. Canberra was born undeformed and healthy and would grow on
                                       and do her work.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e13932"></a>We had realized this for some time. At the end of 7 years of service as
                                       Director Griffin resigned. His plan was gazetted. That means that no change
                                       can be made in it without an act of Parliament. The construction work had by
                                       this time established the plan on the ground and Canberra had become an
                                       established fact and, with Griffin no longer to fight against, the officials
                                       began to realize that carrying on correctly would bring great credit to
                                       them. And so it has been. Round-the-world traveling which had become so
                                       popular before this war, enabled voyagers to see this really unique sight
                                       from Mount Ainslie or Red Hill - a young city and all its suburbs laid out
                                       on the ground before them, beautiful scenery with a background of mountains,
                                       streets constructed, splendid tree plantings evergreen and ever blooming,
                                       with street lights all in, Parliament House and other government buildings,
                                       several residential centers fairly occupied, residences, shops, theatres,
                                       etc. The one thing lacking to make a truly grandiose scene is that the
                                       waters of the Molonglo had not yet been dammed to form the permanent
                                       reflecting basin. The plan as one looks down from the heights will not
                                       really be comprehensible till this is done.

            <p><a name="d0e13935"></a>When they take Griffin's suggestion and dam the lower Molonglo with a dam
                                       comparable to the Burrinjuck, there will be an environing district for
                                       habitation on water frontage comparable to Sydney's miles of foreshore

                                       the world. Not that that has been made obvious to the casual glance, but
                                       structure can be truly modern only when the <u>foundations</u>
                                       are properly laid for that particular thing and so it is with Canberra.

                                       planning in modern times, say of the past 300 years. For this science (and

                                       and decided to take that course. On arriving he found there was no such
                                       course. However, on his demand and through his persuading two or three
                                       others to join him, the course was created in the University of Illinois,
                                       lying in that fertile Mississippi valley. Since then the course has been
                                       established in many universities in Europe and America. Indeed the pressing
                                       need arising from the growth of big cities in recent times, for up to the
                                       latter half of the 19th century there was no such thing as a big city in our
                                       modern sense of the word, this need awakened the conception of the necessity
                                       of foresight in developmental work; and the increasing death toll arising
                                       from the cramming in of modern methods into ancient forms made it clear that
                                       the forming of cities should no longer be left to arise from cow paths nor
                                       real estate subdivisions.

                                       Australian States were federating into a continental nation and then and
                                       there decided to enter the competition for its capital

                                       yet an established profession of landscape Architecture the choice of such
                                       an Architect could be made only through competition.

            <p><a name="d0e14001"></a>For ten years he watched the architectural publications and then, sure
                                       enough, there was the announcement before his eyes. Owing to a busy practice
                                       in 14 states, the months slipped by and nothing was done about it, though
                                       doubtless the matter was brewing within, till finally his wife, performing
                                       that valuable function of the Xanthippes of the world, flew into a rage and
                                       told his that if he didn't start on the design that day she wouldn't do a
                                       stroke of drafting on the thing. The design was begun that day and, after 9
                                       weeks of driving work, toward midnight of a bitterly cold winter night, the
                                       box of drawings, too long to go into a taxi, was rushed with doors open and
                                       the men without their coats - no time to go up 16 stories to get them -
                                       across the city to the last train that could meet the last boat for
                                       Australia, the imperturbable Mr. Griffin himself the only one not quite
                                       frantic by this time because to his mind if Australia was serious about the
                                       matter of their Federal Capital they wouldn't let the moment of the arrival
                                       of the plans be the determining factor in their choice and, to his land
                                       planning mind they couldn't but be serious in such a matter.

            <p><a name="d0e14004"></a>A year later the cable came that Walter Burley Griffin had won the prize. His
                                       words on receiving the message were: - "Ah then I shan't be able to see a
                                       plan better than mine."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14007"></a>A year later again he arrived in Australia taking up his duties as Federal
                                       Director of Design and Construction and for seven years gave himself to the
                                       work. His plan was gazetted which means that it cannot be deviated from
                                       except by an act of Parliament. And at the present time Canberra has become
                                       a center of interest to Australia and to the world though few yet realize
                                       its potentialities. A few months before his death Mr. Griffin, who kept
                                       himself thoroughly posted on matters architectural, said to me that nothing
                                       had yet been put forward in

            <p><a name="d0e14018"></a>Cities are growing things, developing during the centuries, but today, after
                                       two decades, from the top of Mount Ainslie, one can look down on the layout
                                       on the ground of a city with all its suburbs complete. Mr. Griffin did not
                                       expect to see these suburbs in his lifetime. It is one of the world's unique
                                       sights. You see a government doesn't have to pay interest on its capital
                                       investment so can afford to do such things.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14021"></a>There, to the knowing eye, is revealed the fact that here at least the two
                                       essential factors of a city were considered simultaneously and so solved
                                       perfectly, the conditions of occupation which require right angle, or obtuse
                                       angle, allotments, and those of distribution which require radiating
                                       thoroughfares.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14024"></a>City planning, as founded by Mr. Griffin, was not a mechanical drafting board
                                       affair later to be imposed upon the earth destroying whatever got in the way
                                       of this abstraction which might produce a certain monumental beauty but
                                       could only be a dead or dying thing doing its share, not toward keeping the
                                       Earth alive but toward killing it entirely as seems to be the only way in
                                       which the Egos of our people can express themselves at the present time.
                                       However we can keep up our courage knowing that the nature of the Ego, at
                                       first destructive, later can become constructive.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14027"></a>In planning Canberra every detail of the natural conditions was thoroughly
                                       studied in order to preserve them and to make the most of each and
                                       everything so that the City can indeed be a living thing, a healthy, growing
                                       thing. Such reverence for our Mother Earth is acutely necessary now for the
                                       rate of destruction is increasing so rapidly that even a century or two may
                                       make the earth incapable of supporting life, the conclusions of geologists
                                       speaking in terms of former long geological periods to the contrary
                                       notwithstanding. Their theories fall down before actual facts. And the
                                       continent of Australia would do well to learn this lesson from its Capital.

            <p><a name="d0e14035"></a>In the layout of this city alone have the requirements for modern high speed
                                       been met in the two hundred feet wide avenues which are the business streets
                                       and extend from center to center of the various suburbs making possible the
                                       accommodation of high, low and medium speed at different levels and without
                                       level crossings which when put into effect will wipe out the heavy death
                                       rate of our present highways. The subsidiary distributing domestic roads
                                       leading off at right angles from the business avenues are, as they should
                                       be, devious and narrow used as they should be only to bring residents and
                                       their services to the dwellings and domestic community buildings.

            <p><a name="d0e14038"></a>In addition the whole residential area has central open park and play space
                                       off the street frontages in the interior of blocks so that children can
                                       reach their destinations in going to school or other community functions
                                       without traveling on the roads at all but by following park paths which can
                                       dip under even the slow traffic roads by subway paths. And adult population
                                       in the evenings can also take these pleasant ways to the interior central
                                       groups of club rooms, gymnasia, museums, libraries, sport fields and so on.
                                       The city is thus dotted with open spaces which are no extravagance because
                                       they occupy no street frontage.

            <p><a name="d0e14041"></a>From the hill tops, though a spectacular sight, the city plan cannot yet be
                                       understood because the water axis, a system of waterways which will entail
                                       but a trifling expense, has not yet been established. When this is done
                                       which will probably be in the near future the delightful water sports will
                                       be available for the citizenry, and Canberra will have become a true garden
                                       city for a garden is not a garden without water. When in carrying on that
                                       most important of Australia's works, the impounding of water, another dam
                                       comparable to that of Burrinjuck has been constructed somewhat below the
                                       city there will arise a body of water comparable to the Sydney Harbor giving
                                       some 50 miles of superbly beautiful residential area.

                                       Anglo Saxon puritanical feeling that it is immoral to express and clothe
                                       themselves in beauty, though at the same time they look with envy as well as
                                       contempt at beauty expressed by other peoples, when each one realizes that

                                       him, when he realizes that beauty is a necessity for the health of himself
                                       and his children, when he realizes that what each one does should make the
                                       city as you look at it from the hill tops look not less but more beautiful,
                                       when he realizes that each one can assist not in denuding but in reclothing
                                       all the hills not only with soft wood forests but with native loveliness,
                                       perhaps taking Mr. Griffin's suggestion to plant each hill with a
                                       distinctive color, one with reds, another with blues, another with yellow
                                       and gold and so on, then what a breath taking thing the heart of Australia
                                       will have become.

                                       way to put it than to say that Mr. Griffin started a new era. Then again
                                       perhaps we should say James Alexander Smith started a new era in Australia
                                       for he not only carried the Federal Capital through but he trained a whole
                                       group of young engineers who have done things in these recent decades,
                                       climaxing with Mr. <a name="385"></a> [Note: John] Curtin as Prime Minister who did
                                       amazing things. His untimely death is a shocking thing.

            <p><a name="d0e14085"></a>Shortly before I left Australia, I motored down to Canberra with the Trinick
                                       family for the spring show of blossoms for its streets are superbly planted.
                                       Mr. Trinick, curious about the feeling in Canberra, said to an attendant in
                                       one of the shops: - "We tourists enjoy Canberra immensely but I suppose you
                                       folks who have to live down here feel differently," and he suggested that it
                                       wasn't even generally known who was the designer. The young man answered
                                       with some warmth:- "We like it down here very much and everyone here knows
                                       that Mr. Griffin designed Canberra and they feel that through that great
                                       conception of his the soul of Australia is being developed."

                                       notable anniversary passed last Sunday unhonoured and unsung. It was the
                                       16th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House, Canberra, by the Duke
                                       of York, now King George VI. It was also the 42nd anniversary of the opening
                                       of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by a former Duke of
                                       York who afterwards graced the throne as King George V (father of the
                                       present King). Surely it was a day of great memories. Monday May 9th 1927,
                                       "a day of perfect Australian sunshine" at the new Federal Capital (see Argus
                                       report May 5, 1927) lives in memory among all who are left of the 20,000 or
                                       30,000 people who were there on that historic occasion, as a day of great
                                       splendour and dignity and excitement to say nothing of the noise. You will
                                       remember (if you were there) the strange setting for the unique event - the
                                       new white House of Parliament away out in the open country, gleaming in the
                                       sunshine; other white buildings (including two blocks of administrative
                                       offices) at odd places in the wide open spaces round about, some of them
                                       still in the making; numbers of marquees and tents scattered about the
                                       locality too; the new roads, winding about the landscape, shadeless and bare
                                       but for the lines of tree seedlings on either side; piles of building
                                       material here and there, and other signs of a new city coming into being.
                                       You will remember too the great crowd of expectant visitors and the hundreds
                                       of motor cars that carried them there from Sydney, from Melbourne, from
                                       Brisbane, Adelaide, Goulburn, Wagga Wagga, and no one knows how many other

                                       government acts in the distinguishing between towns and cities - Canberra
                                       might not be regarded as a city at all. It has only about 2,500 houses, and
                                       not a great number of other buildings, and the population of the whole
                                       capital territory is little more than 12,000. Yet is not a mere town. It is
                                       more like a town than a city. It is a Town Planner's dream come true; an
                                       enduring testimonial to the genius of the late Walter Burley Griffin, the
                                       Chicago architect who won the Commonwealth Government's prize for the design
                                       for the Federal Capital. It is a place of beautiful buildings, beautiful
                                       trees, and beautiful flowers, to say nothing about the inhabitants. There
                                       are no high buildings, nor ugly buildings, nor slums; no horrible street

                                           site?], no unsightly fences. Instead of the customary picket
                                       fences in front of houses in the residential areas there are low hedges, and
                                       these are trimmed and kept in uniform order by the Department of the
                                       Interior. Almost every street has a central plantation, and there are plenty
                                       of public parks and gardens. Through the trees in many places are to be seen
                                       beautiful views of the distant hills and mountain ranges. Beautiful
                                       Canberra.
