                                       prize winning solution of a plan for the capital city at Canberra,
                                       Australia, in 1913 opened the doors to the new world of Regional City
                                       Planning with a project which will not soon be surpassed. One hundred and
                                       thirty of the most famous architects from all nations competed. Only Griffin
                                       and <a name="18"></a> [Note: Eliel] Saarinen offered a program for a living city - all
                                       the rest were dead patterns - graphic designs of fabulous unrealities. I
                                       could write at length on this man and his work. He died in India in 1938

                                       line was published in any of our Architectural Journals. But I will leave
                                       this subject with a bit of grim humor. Of the one hundred and thirty
                                       competitors for the Canberra City Plan only Griffin, Saarinen and dear

            <p><a name="d0e1412"></a>The Pinnacle was the only building on Castlecrag when we bought the property
                                       - three promontories of Middle Harbor. It certainly was strategically
                                       located. The lower story, a garage and one room, was built of the local
                                       sandstone which again was correct. A narrow stairway led to the attic space
                                       from the rear of which a door and a short flight of exterior steps led out
                                       onto that spectacular terrace from which you could survey two thirds of the
                                       surrounding horizon and the great stretches up and down Middle Harbor and
                                       out through the Sydney Heads to the Pacific Ocean.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1415"></a>We named it The Pinnacle. Its age is unknown but under loving hands it became
                                       not only livable but charming and even elegant in an antique way. Roofing it
                                       with concrete tile was revolutionary in Sydney whose enchanting bluffs had
                                       lost their beauty under the plague of red roofs and red brick walls that had
                                       crept like a skin disease over all Sydney's promontories. Moreover it became
                                       watertight which can't be said of the houses roofed with the Marseilles tile
                                       universal over there where the nature of the storms makes it entirely
                                       unpractical.

            <p><a name="d0e1454"></a>The inexpensive concrete Knitlock tiles were used on the gabled roofs, the
                                       garage was transformed into a great kitchen-dining room and the narrow room
                                       to the east became bedroom, and the studio room upstairs a sumptuous living
                                       room. All this happened by degrees. But it was occupied during the very
                                       early days by a brilliant English journalist and her daughter who from her
                                       babyhood took over the charge of Castlecrag as well as her mother. The story
                                       of Mary of Castlecrag is a wonderful story in itself for she was an outdoor
                                       child and wandered over and continually looked out for the interests of
                                       Castlecrag, safeguarding the flowers, reporting fires - she was the spirit
                                       of the place as if she were incarnated to watch and guard it, knowing every
                                       inlet and crag and flower, as well as tending to her mother's needs for her
                                       mother was mostly in town, interviewing, writing and so on. Later her
                                       mother's literary work took her to London so we lost Mary. But the Pinnacle
                                       was never vacant. You might call it the healthy seed from which Castlecrag
                                       grew into a truly modern municipality.

                                       cylindrical, many of them very showy, red or yellow or orange though
                                       sometimes green. Among them are the Callistemons and Banksias.

            <p><a name="d0e1487"></a>This is a Banksia Marginata decorating the edge of a precipice like a grand
                                       cap on the top of a majestic column. Like so many of the tropic seas, if not
                                       all of them, the water is a vivid blue like azurite or other precious

            <p><a name="d0e1490"></a>The blossoms of the Banksias stand erect on the stems and, after the blossom
                                       time has passed, form a hard wooden cylinder sometimes 8 or 10 inches high.
                                       We used such a bush on one of our interior block reserves, the Ericifolia,
                                       for our Christmas tree in our out-door Christmas celebrations in Castlecrag
                                       for in the antipodes the Christmas is in the summertime.

                                       suspend growth till the rain comes and then boom ahead to make up for lost
                                       time. Nor do they resort to needle leaves to accomplish this but spread
                                       their rich greens in every form of leaf known to deciduous plants.

                                       COMPETITION<br> &amp; MOST ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1514"></a>A dwelling is the most important unit in a human community. It is the most
                                       complicated problem, the one most difficult to solve in the profession of
                                       architecture. The range of its possibilities is endless. Other buildings are
                                       but incidents in the mass of dwellings.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1517"></a>In this unit (Page 15) we present a solution. It is like a life cell in a
                                       living body. In a way the health of the community rests on the perfection of
                                       the single cell as it does in the body.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1520"></a>We ourselves have put this cell to the test. In no point did it fail us -
                                       minimum of care, complete beauty, intimate connection with the garden,
                                       hospitable beyond the normal.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1523"></a>This is one of those surprising forms that give unbelievable results.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1526"></a>It meets the requirements of the three problems and suggests a fourth for a
                                       perfect finish with a 4 foot unit.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1529"></a>With a 3'-6" unit it meets the competition requirements a little more amply
                                       since all four units come within the 1700 square feet limit giving a
                                       completely enclosed inner court. The colonnaded cloister feature could be
                                       added later. The children could build it. In fact if the knitlock tiles were
                                       used the family could build the entire fourth unit.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1532"></a>The exteriors shown in these photographs are not of this building but are
                                       placed here to show the varied ways in which the material can be used - with
                                       either plain or fluted surface, sometimes the flutes appearing on the
                                       outside, sometimes on the inside, sometimes on both outside and inside.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1535"></a>The smaller exterior with the chimney seat on the roof shows how the whole
                                       roof can be utilized for open terrace or veranda. As we used it, it became
                                       an important part of stage settings as for the last scenes of Goethe's
                                       Faust, Part II, and the angel choruses.

                                       the entertainment of our friends who were many. We really led an

            <p><a name="d0e1593"></a>There were no doors in the house except to the bath fixtures. Curtains hung

                                       all parts. We never did cut off the fireplace alcove nor the one opposite
                                       it. Usually the curtain was pushed to shut off the corners leaving the
                                       living room (with a round table in the center) 13' square plus the fireplace
                                       alcove and the three major alcoves. The one opposite the fireplace held the
                                       piano and a library table. The other two held couches (bed springs) one

                                       It was sold the next day. After the owners had been there a couple of years
                                       they had to move across the continent. They offered it for sale and it was

                                       gives a real feeling of the South seas to many a garden and coast line. And

                                       rapidly taking the place of real ones. To one who has seen the spiritual
                                       forces that bathe growing things, varying in color with the seasons, it must
                                       indeed seem the worshipping of brazen images instead of deity.

                                       design of cities and formulating certain principles therefrom, I searched
                                       the library of my university as well as the three metropolitan libraries in
                                       Illinois for comparisons and found only some German contributions of which I
                                       had read the English and French periodical abstracts.

            <p><a name="d0e1744"></a>TOWN PLANNING - For firstly:- Towns, in the local sense, are generally
                                       piecemeal affairs, not entities either in area nor functions.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e1747"></a>CITY PLANNING - City planning suits better in America where Municipal
                                       organizations are single entities and embrace up to a hundred square miles.
            </p>

                                       and Regional planning has to come into vogue.

            <p><a name="d0e1756"></a>NOT HARD AND FAST - And secondly:- That is only one side of the difficulty.
                                       Town Planning as a term includes everything in the Town, whereas everything
                                       is by no means capable of being planned. This has resulted in making of it
                                       often a catch phrase and catch-all for establishing some authority over
                                       everyone and everything in the community which, in a democracy, must work as
                                       more limitation and restriction on individual initiative.

                                       imagination is a function of the individual. Of course, only as far as that

                                       there are no laws for planning, only human faculties that are derived from
                                       knowledge and experience after that knowledge and experience have become
                                       absorbed into a complex of human capacities which defy analysis and from
                                       which they cannot be abstracted by any intellectual analysis, nor organized
                                       into any codes of law. In other words, <u>a plan must be a work
                                              of art</u> and works of art cannot be effected by Boards or

                                       created. If all Towns, Cities, Regions and Continents even are filled with
                                       ever changing planners for all their activities and developments, what scope
                                       is there then for general planning?

                                       proportion as its imaginative picture represents a possible unity and as
                                       that unity appeals to the people whose creative activities are to co-operate
                                       in obtaining and extending it. This is why the scope of effort has so

            <p><a name="d0e1873"></a>OUR NATURAL HERITAGE - Because we have so <u>little</u> of
                                       historical mementoes left, our land planning must stress their preservation,
                                       but it is because we have so much, such great wealth of natural beauty here
                                       in Sydney that our land planning is the most urgent necessity. Our natural
                                       attraction is not a matter of "beauty spots" but of a general character that
                                       is unique among great cities of the world embracing as it does, right at our
                                       doors, a combination of all the famous Azure Coasts, Mountain Lakes, Clean
                                       Evergreen Forests and rich and delicate flora, with a perennial salubrious
                                       climate, and this applies to the coasts to the North including Port Stephens
                                       though at that point we have a sealevel entrance to the interior of the
                                       continent.

            <p><a name="d0e1879"></a>DISCRIMINATION IN USE - Of course it is not planning that preserves these
                                       advantages, for planning is after all only arrangement, but it is only
                                       through forethought in the arrangement of our operations that best use and
                                       maximum conservation of our resources are rendered possible.

                                       Council has for several years been constructing as relief work a "Scenic
                                       Drive" at the cost of their chief scenic feature traversed, the unique bluff
                                       now disfigured by the huge ugly rock excavation, an open wound across it
                                       that will not heal and which has destroyed much of its charm forever. These
                                       so-called scenic roads are without plan because a plan implies a
                                       comprehensive purpose and not the defeat of the purpose through the means
                                       employed. For instance, one way traffic routes would have accomplished at
                                       once the access to the scenery and saved the scenery itself though it would
                                       not have employed so much relief labor which was the immediate expedient
                                       that irreparably defiled the last vestige that is left of Sydney's first <u>PRIDE</u> - the Harbor of unsurpassed beauty.

                                       the foliage of the whole tree. In West Australia the gums run a race with
                                       all the other trees and shrubs. They are like Shakespeare's Bottom, they
                                       want to be the lion too. They deck themselves out in blossoms now this
                                       color, now that, some pink come yellow, they will not be outdone, and the
                                       Ficifolia comes out sometimes one shade of red, sometimes another but mostly
                                       an indescribable rich henna - a brilliant orange toned red. I can't find a
                                       word to describe it. No wonder my husband and I quarrel over the naming of
                                       colors. No words fit.

                                       the Gum Trees turn to every color of the rainbow and many shades that no
                                       respectable rainbow ever indulged in. Stately avenue trees too so that the
                                       whole streets can be planted to the unbelievable henna flames, or pink or
                                       yellow. Not blue. There are Blue Gums but it is the exquisite blue of their
                                       young leaves that gives them their name, not the blossoms. Think of the
                                       slopes of the Rocky Mountains planted to masses of this color, not too far
                                       above frost lines! "Well why not? Come on let's."

            <p><a name="d0e2317"></a>Second - To reverse the usual city building methods which have to do with
                                       town lot speculation schemes, and to substitute therefore the more modern
                                       plan which provides for a long term lease of the lands for both agricultural
                                       and business purposes.

                                       small tracts and by means of co-operative selling plans provide a market at

            <p><a name="d0e2323"></a>Fourth - To establish a district Agricultural School similar to those
                                       operating in Belgium, Holland and Denmark and through which the farm life of
                                       those countries has been regenerated by making the small truck farm
                                       profitable.

            <p><a name="d0e2326"></a>To Mr. Preston B. Moss more perhaps than to any other man is due the growth
                                       of the city of Billings and the marvelous development of the surrounding
                                       country. He was convinced that some better method than buying land and
                                       reselling it would have to be adopted if actual settlers were to be
                                       protected. Mr. Moss secured a site that meets admirably every requirement
                                       and need of commerce and trade and ideal social amenities; and in Walter
                                       Burley Griffin he found the man of the hour in modern city development. Mr.
                                       Griffin after making a personal inspection of the site gave it his
                                       unqualified and enthusiastic approval, and undertook the preparation of the
                                       plans. Mr. Griffin inspected the site on his return trip from Australia
                                       where he had just closed a contract with the Federal Government to
                                       superintend the construction of the capital city Canberra.

            <p><a name="d0e2380"></a>THE FIG IS A SORT OF RUBBER PLANT and it pours its roots fantastically over
                                       the rocks till the gnomes make some entry open in the rocks for then to
                                       enter. The gnomes don't bother with them till all the other plants have been
                                       attended to. Without the help of the gnomes the roots of plants could not
                                       make their way through the earth nor could the leaves and flowers and fruit
                                       develop without the help of the undines, sylphs and fire fairies. All these
                                       things require intelligence though the blind materialists of today are all
                                       like Topsy who thought she just growed without any father and mother.

                                       but makes use of it all. That is where the Undines are at work. In the

            <p><a name="d0e2396"></a>One would not rashly venture upon prophesy of startling developments in 50
                                       years in the matter of a record line such as architecture if he were to be
                                       guided by the relics of this art and the all but geologically slow
                                       transformations distinguishable within the period of any given people or
                                       civilization. Nevertheless because architecture is, in a most subtle and
                                       accurate way, a reflex of life the prophet may find better grounds for
                                       interesting speculation in the thoughts and tenets of his time though he may
                                       detect only germinal ideas just seeming to extend tentative rootlets.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2399"></a>When as a boy I consulted Herbert Spencer's philosophy for enlightenment and
                                       found architecture considered virtually an ecclesiastical appendage, the
                                       notion seemed a preposterous limitation and I feel sure that my reaction
                                       represents the typical modern attitude toward this art. Just so. But after
                                       studying the buildings and noting with astonishment the absence of creative
                                       architecture in the western world for half a millennium, in fact since
                                       medieval times, the force of Spencer's observation became striking if not
                                       conclusive. Moreover in the face of the worldwide testimony of the stones
                                       that the religious structures have been the only ones to make lasting
                                       contributions to the art of architecture it is meet to give pause as to what
                                       architecture is when considered a live, growing thing, not a grave yard.

            <p><a name="d0e2402"></a>Buildings can tell the story of dead architecture as well as live
                                       architecture and we have ample record in the Roman Empire of at least one
                                       age before ours where the minds were possibly too much directed toward
                                       superficial ease and comfort to find opportunity for much <u>exercise of the imagination which is undoubtedly the most real
                                              satisfaction obtainable from life</u>. When we first reflect upon our
                                       own times we may well be flattered to recognize, in the mirror, the
                                       Scientific Age. Then our characteristic physiognomy in our buildings
                                       constitutes a scientific architecture and that is about the best we can say
                                       for it so far.

            <p><a name="d0e2426"></a>We do find economic structural triumphs in vast tunnels and bridges and
                                       skyscraping towers and mechanical utensils marvelous beyond all precedents.

            <p><a name="d0e2429"></a>But these achievements seem to be of short vogue and constantly going out of
                                       fashion before something still more economical or "scientific" and, though
                                       an individual architectural designer, a Louis Sullivan, may now and then
                                       attain to considerable flights of creative art, such flights have commanded
                                       insufficient sympathy from the public, support from the business men or
                                       co-operation from professional colleagues to bring about any general
                                       elevation of standards, which only amounts to another way of stating the
                                       case that Architecture is a reflection of the civilization or culture that
                                       it houses. This is so because in its broadest sense Architecture is the art
                                       not only for the man in the street but by the average man. It alone among
                                       the arts denies to "genius," the exception, or the man ahead of his time,
                                       the very forces, the colors, the notes, the words with which to express
                                       himself or to blaze a path for the masses. The latter must here painfully
                                       and gropingly tread out their own uncertain way.

            <p><a name="d0e2432"></a>If the ideal of the current culture is personal economic security or, in the
                                       last analysis, economic rivalry then we must lack the concord that could
                                       express itself in an environment of harmonious forms. If moreover a given
                                       culture, in its profound cravings, is devoted to ferreting out practical
                                       relationships and working hypotheses among physical phenomena, then that
                                       culture cannot be expected to express itself with unbounded enthusiasm in
                                       the playthings of life, nor to have much concern with the subjective
                                       universal mind and the emotional satisfaction of the art and joy of living.
                                       Instead our one-eyed intellectual, objective attitude toward life has
                                       relegated art to a sort of learned cult with orders and precedents
                                       sanctioned by rules and regulations which, even when derived from ancient
                                       religious expression, do with very poor propriety constitute the authority
                                       for referees in a professional game of Architecture. But a practical

                                       construction in a year that centuries of legions could not accomplish
                                       before. What a contrast with the actuality;- Unhappy timid people with their
                                       buildings (the monuments do not lie) a monotonous reiteration of the

            <p><a name="d0e2524"></a>The people of today are uneasy, straining at their limitations whether they
                                       realize or not that these limitations are in the restricted direction of
                                       their mental activities. Signs of this state are in the hectic sources of
                                       recreation and mental relief so largely at present dependent on the external
                                       stimuli, spectacles, thrills, jolts, jars, jazz, joy-rides, wagers,
                                       "flickers," cabarets, air and water stunts and speedways. All these aim at
                                       emotional satisfaction and so far as they serve to achieve enduring pleasure
                                       something of creative art will arise out of them but little is in evidence
                                       so far of such results. We can judge from our individual experiences how
                                       little better than intoxicants are the ever-multiplying diversions, and
                                       posterity will have ample proof of their futility in our discordant houses.

                                       less hypocrisy than in the puritanical pretensions of only a few years back
                                       that I think our materialism has so far advanced as to be no longer
                                       comparable to a supernatural counterpart, another external agency, which has
                                       been proven in the end a futile evasion of the awful logical consequences to
                                       our human desires of the exorable external material automatism now being
                                       accepted for better or worse. Better or worse it must soon be, for a hectic
                                       state can only bring quick exhaustion.

                                       flaunting exploitation of the feelings, emotions. If the parallel can be
                                       maintained the working out of a new common idea will be even more rapid in
                                       the coming era than was the unexampled development of the scientific and
                                       practical ideal in the past three centuries, and it is inevitable that even
                                       half a century will mark definite progress because the factors contributing
                                       to development upward or downward are now brought before the whole world

                                       curiosity has been satiated by science and the economic strain eased by
                                       practical expedients, when the physical senses are become callous to

                                       has been inconsistent or in conflict, fundamentally, with life. We have come
                                       to recognize an external natural order of things which we see, hear, touch,
                                       smell and taste and consider real. But, as such a world of isolated
                                       individual intellect supplied no place for such instinctive ideals or
                                       desires as beauty or justice, and if the supernatural or divine world once
                                       conceived by us to support those ideals has lost its reality, we are not far

                                       the complexities of the human mind and soul and the conditions for
                                       full-rounded healthy working. From these students a practical religion may
                                       be forthcoming compatible with modern objective science but taking into
                                       account, without the prop of external agencies, our vaster subjective
                                       activities, desires and needs. Then again will the imagination and the
                                       creative powers of mankind be unbound and free for an Architecture as far
                                       transcendent of historical efforts as is our science of construction and our

            <p><a name="d0e2634"></a>There are over 500 varieties of eucalypts in Australia which we might say is
                                       the habitat of the gums though a few are native in Mexico and perhaps
                                       somewhere else. The wattles run them a close second mounting up to some 400.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2637"></a>In this eucalyptus diversicolor we have one of the tall fellows which
                                       sometimes shoot up a 180 feet before branching. Some of them are as tall as
                                       our sequoias in California which has been counted the tallest tree in the
                                       world. But they attain no such girth. For huge trunks we have to go to the
                                       native beech of Russell Falls, of Tasmania though not limited to this
                                       region. The foliage of this Beech is like our maiden hair fern, leaflets the
                                       size of your thumb nail with serrated edges, multiple pinnate. This
                                       combination of exquisiteness and majesty is breath-taking.

            <p><a name="d0e2665"></a>Foresight is requisite. Without it man is not human. He becomes not animal
                                       but beast. Foresight means planning. Planning must include a totality, from
                                       a continent to the tiniest unit, a single home in relation to its neighbors.

                                       favor and prestige) was continuous throughout his quarter of a century
                                       adventure in the Eastern Hemisphere. He and his wife began their adult life
                                       with the beginning of the 20th century, a century that has indulged in the
                                       most dreadful wars the world has ever known. These are the European peoples
                                       who in recent times have migrated to all parts of the world, destroying,
                                       always destroying. Let us see if in such a world we can find constructors
                                       who point the way out.

                                       over the burnt district, for he felt it was a sight I ought not to miss. The
                                       desolate picture is as vivid today as then, and it seems as though fairies
                                       must have worked to efface every trace of such a desolate field of
                                       destruction. I only remember a woman carrying a pan of milk; and Asa Gage
                                       saying that after walking quite a distance down Wabash avenue he noticed he
                                       was carrying a potted plant.

            <p><a name="d0e2694"></a>There were many broken hearts and lost fortunes but the prevailing spirit
                                       was, "We are alive and work will restore." Jere for a while wrote a daily
                                       column for the Herald; published a magazine for Mr. Barnes of New York; a
                                       school magazine for Chicago teachers; edited the Prairie Farmer; and was
                                       principal of a school. A man on top of a bus pointed to Jere who was going
                                       over the bridge and said, "There goes a man who can carry more work on his
                                       shoulders than any other man, with never a grumble and always a smile." He
                                       was a fearless writer and a poet.

                                       in the middle of the crust a jumping jack stuck his head out. The tree was
                                       always a beauty with its frost and tinsel, the room gay with lights, berries
                                       and evergreens and happy faces. For a few years several children of our
                                       eighth grade we would treat to ice-cream up stairs, then, at the proper

                                       around the piano singing Christmas carols (breathtaking, the music, for
                                       Mother's school was in Chicago's Bohemian district). Sometimes a charade or
                                       a little play by the children themselves but, on account of the little ones,
                                       an early start home. After guests were gone we hung up our stockings and put
                                       a big basket in front of the fireplace for overflows.

                                       was walking with Mr. Hoyne. He said to him, "Phil how did Howland get in?

                                       in another incarnation himself be physically beautiful. We comprehended this

                                       the reason why there are so many commonplace people today is because they
                                       are taught to read at too early an age, another consequence of which is
                                       premature sclerosis. One of the most interesting people of my acquaintance

                                       no teaching until she was twelve. Entering school then she rapidly put

                                       along the lake shore are still high and steep. There were four families who
                                       ruled the whole realm, nearly two miles from north to south, and which, west
                                       of the track, was occupied by as few houses and, except for them, empty for

                                       was the head of the North branch of the Chicago river, whose waters should
                                       have been controlled but never drained off. What a thrilling and mysterious
                                       place this Skokie was of which one heard some dreadful tales! It was a great
                                       sea of grass dotted with islands, of trees, but no one could venture there
                                       for the surface of the ground had no foundation below it. Jerome once went

                                       there was an assistant in the family, a young Irish woman who enjoyed her

            <p><a name="d0e2830"></a>One wintry day when the waves had piled hills over the water and shore right
                                       up to the bluff, a group of children on a tour of discovery had found and
                                       investigated one of the caves in the ice and peered through holes in the ice
                                       floor to see the waters they could hear rushing below. As they came out
                                       there was father coming toward them. He said nothing but they all went home
                                       together. The idea that little children know their elders' thoughts without
                                       words one can well understand because of the vividness of the picture of her
                                       father, as they appeared from nowhere before his eyes, still in her memory.
                                       He had evidently been searching and frightened but he said nothing to
                                       frighten them. That was like her father for she remembers too how, when he
                                       came home from Chicago at night, he used to take her on his knee and let her
                                       count the change in his pocket. Each time she used to "nick" <a name="64"></a> [Note: i.e.,
                                           steal, take] something but he never said anything nor did he ever
                                       forbid the counting of his change. The game didn't last long, and of course
                                       he knew what she was doing, but she has always been grateful that he didn't
                                       by any word or look plant in her mind, for it was a sensitive mind like any
                                       child's, an idea that she was doing a sinful thing. It helped her to be able
                                       to counsel many a mother later for it was one of those personal experiences
                                       which enable one later to comprehend children whereas most grown-ups these
                                       days have no understanding at all of what a different thing a child is from
                                       a grown-up: that, for instance, a child can't form moral concepts before the

            <p><a name="d0e2852"></a>This cheapest form of masonry construction, knitlock, invented by Griffin
                                       before he left the United States for Australia, gives a five room house
                                       within the area of a usual four room house, and, since interior and exterior
                                       walls are identical, can be added to at any time without extra cost.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e2855"></a>This house is in a stone district so the knitlock has been used in connection
                                       with the local sandstone. Endless charming note can be effected by the
                                       combined use of these two local materials for the tiles in this case were
                                       made from more or less disintegrated local stone which varies in color from
                                       white to yellow to russet red.

            <p><a name="d0e2878"></a>There was a similar experience later in life with a five year old niece
                                       coming to Aunt who was to be counted on in time of trouble. She had broken a
                                       saucer and wanted Aunt to hide it. That was as far as her child cleverness,
                                       slyness if you will, could take her. So Aunt said "All right." But after a
                                       few moments she said - "But what if Mother found it? Then she would have to
                                       punish you. But, now, if you tell her and say you are sorry she can't punish
                                       you, can she?" She gave the matter cool consideration and accepted Aunt's
                                       advice. It worked. Moreover she grasped the whole working principle and
                                       after that not only 'fessed up but heaped such ingenious terms of reproach
                                       upon herself that one couldn't scold her, there was nothing left to be said.
                                       Children are clever. They should be handled on those lines during those
                                       early years. She is the one who wouldn't eat meat after she found that
                                       people killed "tame" chickens and, "Why did they kill tame cows?" Her mother
                                       laughed when she announced that her religion was the vegetable religion so
                                       she turned to me with - "There is such a religion isn't there Aunt?" "Yes,"
                                       aunt said, "in India those of the Buddhist religion eat only vegetables."
                                       "Well, that's my religion," she said. And she lived up to it which required
                                       the family to go far in that direction.

                                       playground, taking turns on father's shoulders as he swam out and out,

                                       road, one of the four families who constituted the charming community in
                                       this great and lovely domain which has now become the most elegant of
                                       Chicago's suburbs, watching these two men's heads way out in the lake as
                                       they sat on a sand bar and talked and talked for they were both journalists
                                       at that time, father "the best slinger of the king's English in Chicago." Or
                                       dimly conscious on another afternoon, the water fairly rough and father way
                                       out, his head barely visible on the wave's crest and then gone from sight,
                                       that mother who would never go in swimming was sitting on the sand at the
                                       foot of the bluff, very still for a very long time, unobservant of her
                                       children (I remember it vividly), with her eyes glued on that distant black
                                       speak. For father had got caught in a current. They call the lake
                                       treacherous but I refuse to use a word so inappropriate to a superb creature
                                       which is but leading its own life in its own perfect way. And father was
                                       fighting for his life and gradually won his way back, superb swimmer that he
                                       was. Again the vividness of the remembrance shows that she read her parent's
                                       thoughts as children do in those early years.

            <p><a name="d0e2927"></a>Both these houses were built of local stone, the one on the water frontage of
                                       lime stone. This frontage was simply a continuation of the vertical old
                                       quarry wall. When completed Griffin climbed from the river bottom to the
                                       roof of the house. This is in Mason City, U.S.A.

            <p><a name="d0e2930"></a>The keystones of the upper windows were carried in stepped form above the
                                       roof. Aesthetically it solved the problem of the flat roof. This was the
                                       origin of the motif so popular since in city buildings and bridges, etc., in
                                       Russia, India, Australia, the United States. An imagination once conceived
                                       and executed is reflected in the others and becomes accessible to
                                       imaginative thinkers, and of course to the uninspired who follow and often
                                       claim.

            <p><a name="d0e2933"></a>The ravine dwelling in Sydney, Australia, was built of the local stone which
                                       there is the old Potsdam sandstone.

                                       and so making bookcases, cupboards, wardrobes or fireplaces in the interior.
                                       Every necessity is taken advantage of to add beauty to the dwelling. Thus
                                       minimum cost dwellings have the beauty and charm of the expensive ones.

                                       o'clock in the morning as any other time. One night the Chisholm family and
                                       guests dressed up as Indians and raided the Mahony house. Another evening we
                                       all went over there. Mrs. Chisholm, fat as any prima donna, was a lovely
                                       soprano and that night mother with her "India rubber face" as one of her old
                                       teachers used to call her, told a funny story of the family with the crooked
                                       mouths trying to blow out the candle before going to bed, and father who had
                                       never heard her tell a story before because she was not a raconteur, circled
                                       round and round through the rooms hating to miss any of it yet unable to
                                       endure the agony of his own laughter. And one night mother waked her up
                                       early in the morning to see Venus. She is sure she has never seen it so big
                                       since.

            <p><a name="d0e2956"></a>Week ends were apt to be stirring compared with the very quiet week days for
                                       guests were continually dropping off at the Lakeside station and Xanthippe,
                                       always a tomboy, was usually called upon to climb the tree in front of the
                                       porch, branchless to the height of the house, which she alone could climb
                                       none of the boys being equal to it. She had a way of her own, bare footed,
                                       monkey fashion, soles of her feet planted against the trunk. If her feelings
                                       ever got hurt which didn't happen often and of which she has no
                                       recollection, she would slip away (so her aunt told her in later life) and
                                       hide herself way down under the bed clothes and was so tiny as to make a
                                       hardly perceptible bump.

            <p><a name="d0e2959"></a>And then one day when there had been a grand clean-up for a weekend party,
                                       and mother had oiled the floors and put the rags up in the attic which
                                       certainly could run a temperature on a hot day, and the family and the first
                                       guest, Ruthven Pike, had all gone to sleep after an all day and evening
                                       picnic, the house caught fire, spontaneous combustion from those oil rags
                                       and burned to the ground.

                                       Xanthippe, woke her and put the baby in her arms and sent her across the
                                       street to the Chisholm's. It was Katie who told the tale of how provoked she
                                       was to see Mr. Pike deliberately completing a careful toilet even to the
                                       perfect tying of his tie, and then seeing that it was he who, coming out of
                                       his room, went straight to the barrel of gasoline and rolled it out of the
                                       house, quite likely in this way forestalling an explosion. The family had to
                                       go to Chicago to live. Xanthippe spending a year with her beloved Aunt Myra,

                                       have had grand times together. It would have been a fine chance for me to
                                       have put you through your paces in drawing and painting. I think I'll make

                                       scarcely a part of ourselves that it does not seem like telling personal

            <p><a name="d0e2996"></a>It seemed too bad and rather outrageous to run away from home at Christmas
                                       time but as it was then or never I decided I could not afford to throw away
                                       the opportunity. Had promised candy for Walt to give to some of his favorite
                                       ladies but guests came unexpectedly to dinner on the last night so the next
                                       morning on his telling me he would lend a hand I undertook to boil up some
                                       candy. At the end of about a half hour, he was struck with compunction at
                                       not going to the office so my human limitations made it impossible for me to
                                       do more than finish the boiling of the batch I had on the stove and lay out
                                       materials required and leave him to manage the rest as best he could, which
                                       to the amazement of all of us, he did most successfully and proud as a
                                       peacock he was over it too. All this meant a wild rush at the last moment to
                                       catch the boat which for the next 24 hours I wished I had never caught since
                                       the trip on the Loongana, which is never painted in glowing colors, everyone
                                       said was the worst ever. The storm was over before we reached Tasmania where
                                       we had a wonderful fortnight which enabled me to add a number of unique
                                       trees to my set of Forest Portraits.

                                       the plant has no need of earthly things for its nourishment but only for its

                                       and then narrows up to a slender oval in section at another according to its

                                       reaching out twisting and contorting as if they were in water, indeed in
                                       every way often resembling water animals, this pink barked tree resembling a
                                       great octopus with outstretching twisting and contorting tentacles. This is
                                       because the vegetation originated in the Lemurian times when the partially
                                       solidified parts of the earth were still bathed in heavy mists so that the
                                       vegetables as well as the animals were still sea creatures. The platypus

            <p><a name="d0e3087"></a>In his treatise on painting, Leonardo da Vinci dealt with art's fundamental
                                       values. First he declared that no artist is worthy of praise unless he is
                                       universal; that he should acquaint himself with all the phases of life; that
                                       he should disdain to make pictures out of other pictures, but should go
                                       directly to life and, <u>having mastered all the technical
                                              intricacies of his calling, he should use his imagination and build up
                                              an art</u>. Certainly this is impregnable doctrine. In the second place
                                       he advised close contact with nature.

            <p><a name="d0e3093"></a>Now I wish to develop this attitude toward the modern field of architecture.
                                       You are starting where I bespeak 30 years experience and hence dwell on what
                                       seems the most important issue albeit the most disagreeable of all subjects
                                       for us. The subject is not chosen because of its attractiveness. The topic
                                       is in fact disagreeable in the extreme for our architecture is only
                                       manifestation of the diseased condition of our society in whose body the
                                       faculties of art are all but atrophied.

            <p><a name="d0e3096"></a>When we come to think of it, no art has nor merits in our day so great
                                       popular appeal as music, yet even that appeal means so little that we here
                                       cannot afford or find the time of one person in 10,000 for a dozen days out
                                       of the 365 for the presentation of the most adequate form of musical
                                       expression - that of the symphonic orchestra. If we are able to excuse
                                       ourselves in the fact that no community elsewhere does better, that is so
                                       much the worse for the status of music.

                                       the significance of this absence of status to civilization is so appalling
                                       and the consequence so inevitably disastrous to society that we may pursue
                                       it further. When architecture had a status its scope was nothing less than
                                       the harmonizing of man's habitat with his physical environment, external
                                       nature. Instinctively the other living things have this faculty and all
                                       vegetable and animal structures comprise a congruous whole. Beaver dams, ant
                                       hills, beehives, bird nests and bowers exhibit the first essential
                                       principal, economy of effort (play), necessary to harmony.

                                       exhibit also the second essential - subordination to nature, and indicate
                                       something in these civilizations that we lack - a closer relationship of man

                                       Indians in America are as distinctly part and parcel of a homogeneous nature
                                       as is the Eskimo Igloo and all these certainly represent more scientific,
                                       economic and comfortable housing under their conditions than do our houses
                                       constructed now after 2000 years to the specifications of Vitruvius for <u>the Roman army hutments of Augustus Caesar</u>.

                                       detached to take an artistic standpoint could find any satisfaction in such
                                       a collection of incongruities as this street outside whose only merit is
                                       faithfulness to the ostentation, imitation, greed and intolerance, every
                                       anti-social force that actuates our civilization. The absence of that
                                       disinterested point of view accounting for the lack of architects, and
                                       specialization and preoccupation amongst the most of us concerned with
                                       esthetic matters, has resulted in the unleashing of the forces of men to
                                       destruction.

                                       ruthless invasion of nature on every hand. Even Sydney Harbor will have
                                       become a by-word before the fact is realized that it is becoming more and
                                       more a catchword. Each year more and more are forests ring-barked, fields
                                       eroded and pest-infected, rivers befouled and dredged, factory-invaded and
                                       slashed by railways. Cliffs are hacked off for motor tourists with more and
                                       more vegetation dust-coated, and disfigured with advertisements and pole
                                       lines. Continuously more and more are the flowering shrublands burned off to
                                       grassy uniformity and an everlasting sameness substituted for infinite
                                       variety. Even the same few gaudy genera of plants are gradually monopolizing
                                       all the gardens of every climate in a more common, commonplace and
                                       accessible world of less interest, less mystery and less charm.

                                       divergent races; all animals except stock and vermin; all uneconomic plants
                                       except weeds; and the dissipation of all economic minerals, in fact the
                                       spoliation of all our resources to end in an ant-like existence and the
                                       elimination of the soul. There is no force now in evidence to stop this
                                       tendency and we are safe in assuming that no material force nor government
                                       nor economic necessity can overcome a force that has been gaining momentum
                                       for four hundred years. Nothing short of the acceptance of a new idea of
                                       what we are here for can reverse this current in which man has abandoned his
                                       manifold individual faculties to an intellectual authority on the plane of
                                       physics, presuming that this authority derived from discoveries in the field
                                       of science is sufficient to rival the scheme of nature itself. It is an
                                       egoistic and vain presumption which must yield to attack in turn if such
                                       attack be made from the vantage point of man's spiritual relationship with
                                       nature for there is a perfection, infinity and intelligence in natural
                                       phenomena continually eluding the curiosity of the scientist and which
                                       therefore it is the proper business of our art to respect. After all,
                                       psychology admits that 90 per cent of our mentality is subconscious and it
                                       should be easily perceived that where the ant, for instance, can exist in
                                       complete ignorance of man's world, there are certainly realities beyond the
                                       scope of our conscious intelligence.

                                       This latter is a stately tree with a dark rough bark. The only technical
                                       difference between the gums and the Angophoras is that the Eucalyptus has a
                                       spherical seed pod with a cover, the word eucalyptus means "I cover thee."
                                       The Angophora has no cover. The flowers of both are the same, compact

                                       Everything is so decorative and to me, an architect, the function of
                                       painting is decoration, mural decoration. You don't have to be an artist
                                       there, the picture presents itself to you in perfection. You put it down

                                       ancient city on his own plantation. Well it wasn't just that way with us but

            <p><a name="d0e3464"></a>The senor <a name="84"></a> [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] had scarcely arrived in
                                       Australia when he made up his mind that he would look about for the best
                                       location for developing a high class residential suburb. The first two or
                                       three years the pace was too great to do anything about it. But just the
                                       same he kept thinking about it and made up his mind that Sydney was the best
                                       for such an undertaking. They had accepted single tax there and it was
                                       booming ahead of Melbourne and rapidly becoming the Metropolis of the
                                       continent. So presently he started a thorough search, motored in every
                                       direction, searched the titles office and finally settled on the Middle
                                       Harbor district. Beauty Point looked very attractive so he began
                                       negotiations for purchase but he deliberated too long and another man cut in
                                       and finalized a purchase. We had not yet sufficiently mastered that other
                                       external world - our souls - not to feel the pang of a heart-break.

            <p><a name="d0e3470"></a>But this was all to the good for now he found out that three of the
                                       promontories beyond, which everyone had said were crown land, were really
                                       owned in London. He found a Sydney agent who had been connected with this
                                       property and asked him to get the owners to quote a price for the first

                                       water, is a perfect cone like Fuji Yama, only a perpetual green and blossoms

                                           Carrington, Governor of New South Wales] had, like Griffin, taken
                                       a water trip up Middle Harbor some forty years before and realized what a
                                       lovely suburb it would make. He chased down titles, bought in and thus
                                       unified the properties, formed a company, sold shares to the Lords and
                                       Ladies of England, got the charming suspension bridge started across the
                                       first valley, pressed the government to put a tram line across from the
                                       occupied suburb to the South, and then the boom burst. That was Australia's
                                       big bust. All the gold went to England for the Boer War. The bottom dropped
                                       out of everything. The Company went bankrupt and passed into the hands of
                                       the bridge contractors. Then they went bankrupt and the property passed into
                                       the hands of the debenture holders in London and there it lay. They had
                                       never seen the property. From descriptions it sounded impossible for
                                       occupancy, steep and rocky precipices unfit for habitation.

            <p><a name="d0e3520"></a>So when nearly half a century later a prospect of sale came they said "all or
                                       nothing" and Griffin was asked to make an offer. He offered what he had
                                       expected to pay for one promontory and got all three. The pity was we didn't
                                       keep it all in our own hands for as it turned out we could have handled it
                                       and would have gotten along much better without the trouble makers we got
                                       tied up with in the company that was formed.

                                       outlook at all. Steep dangerous roads ran down the slopes, great scars to

                                       shone over valleys filled with mists stretching horizontally and curling up
                                       at the ends as the Japanese show them in their prints; veil after veil till
                                       you could count ten distinct planes so that North Head looked as if it were
                                       many miles away. Or again, at night, the spectacle of the full moon and its
                                       wide wake, there in your own house, a permanent but constantly changing

                                       these beautiful districts but showed how they could be occupied without
                                       destroying their natural beauty. Long, long

                                       other side the street was 40 feet below us. The way of planning the house as
                                       well as the planting helped this though there were no formal hedges.

                                       consciousness brought to an end. After those years together in work and
                                       play, breakfast over and the house in order and leaving for the office
                                       together, the busy days with its long hours, return together. Then came that

                                       facilitate the work of the draftsmen and shorten the often long hours of

                                       house built on a floating pier attached to the rocks of a sheer precipice a
                                       hundred feet high so there was no way out at the back. Since I had no boat
                                       there was no way out for me. But the company engineer lived in a waterside
                                       cottage within coo-ee and he brought me victuals and drink. The senor

                                       on the waves. The King was up off and on all through the night, sure we had
                                       broken loose, going out the back door to feel the precipice. Neither love
                                       nor money could make him stay the second night.

            <p><a name="d0e3696"></a>But a fortnight's vacation once in five years was enough for me so I moved
                                       into one of the company stone houses built at the time of the original
                                       subdivision and auction sale. This method was used to establish values but
                                       not resorted to afterwards. The rest of the property is being disposed of by
                                       agents in direct touch with individual clients, the only method appropriate
                                       to a covenanted estate. A year had passed since the auction sale during
                                       which road construction and several stone houses had been built. But the
                                       sales had been far from satisfactory, and at this time had practically
                                       ceased. We finally figured that there was a conspiracy among the share
                                       holders to squeeze Griffin out of the company - a method not so unusual as
                                       you might think. Now as always there were streams of people going through
                                       this property which was in the nature of a National Park to the crowded
                                       districts back of it. Its lovely wooded slopes and miles of waterfrontage on
                                       the quietest of the Sydney Harbors made it a natural playground.

                                       something not on the surface in the failure of the agents to make hardly
                                       any. Later revelations confirmed our suspicions. My success in making sales
                                       wiped out the deficit of the proceeding two years so that the books showed a

                                       the way are perfectly adapted to planting in Australia, in this continent on
                                       the other side of the Indian Ocean the flowers are almost all small but very
                                       showy in their massing. One of these, the Styphelioides, is a stately avenue

                                       mass of white blossoms though sometimes only half the tree decides to
                                       blossom. They have their whims in Australia.

                                       come the gum tips, the new foliage, make a wonderful show and everybody is

                                       none of my own, has been spent in making them "naughty." To me it was an
                                       obvious perversion of nature to try to instill moral notions into little
                                       children and a very apparent imposition on the part of grown-ups to make
                                       life easier for themselves at no matter what cost of loss of character to
                                       the young. My instincts were later on confirmed in this matter when I
                                       learned that up to the 7th year, marked by the change of teeth, the life
                                       forces are necessary for the task of developing the physical body and only
                                       then are freed making it possible for a child to form moral concepts.
                                       Precocity here reacts injuriously on the physical body.

                                       to Sydney, had turned mischievous, a pest to young and old in the family. I
                                       suggested that he bring her up to "aunt" for a visit. I was chiefly occupied
                                       at this time in making a set of forest portraits on satin of Australia's
                                       peculiarly decorative trees. In this bush a child could roam at will.

            <p><a name="d0e3812"></a>From across the valley this tiny house looks like a veritable castle. The
                                       flower boxes extend the corners of the building up to door and windowhead
                                       height giving cupboards in the interior rooms and gaiety to the exterior.

                                       run up even above the main roof height and are finished with four flaring

                                       stayed about two months when "uncle," coming up from Melbourne, unwisely
                                       told her that the baby chickens were coming out of their eggs back home.
                                       Alstan promptly decided that she must go back to see the chickens and told
                                       everybody she met for the next few days that the chickens were coming out
                                       and she must go home to see them. So home she went.

            <p><a name="d0e3835"></a>After the first few days, I had been shocked to find that her baby soul was
                                       filled with fears. All her games hung on fears. When it rained she ran into
                                       the house afraid of the rain. I drove her out saying, "Go out and play with
                                       the water fairies who have come down to dance with you."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e3838"></a>With breakfast over, each morning we packed a lunch and went out for the day,
                                       I with my drawing paraphernalia and, walking or rowing, we would find my
                                       tree. One day as we followed a path along the hillside, I noticed that
                                       Alstan was hopping from one side of me to the other, and I realized that a
                                       small stray dog was trailing along with us. I made her choose her side and
                                       stay there. Then I made her hold her hand down instead of jerking it up.
                                       Later in the day when she stubbed her toe and cried a bit and the dog
                                       insisted on licking the tears from her eyes I said, "Well then stop crying.
                                       He is just kissing the tears away." And finally when she took her nap on the
                                       ground at my side, the dog insisted on sleeping close to her cheek. After
                                       this day's discipline the fear dropped entirely away from the child. She
                                       accepted the statement I made that dogs were friends of people but that they
                                       were not always sure people would be friends to them so you had to hold out
                                       your hand to show them you were a friend. And I must confess that when I saw
                                       her going up and holding out her little hand to dogs that seemed far from
                                       amiable to me, I myself was frequently fearsome <a name="104"></a> [Note: i.e., apprehensive,
                                           frightened]. But on her return home she took the whole family in
                                       hand and broke down their fears. Her father wrote me saying, "What have you
                                       done to Alstan? She is a changed child physically, mentally and morally."
                                       The outdoor life so important to all children had been hers for two months

            <p><a name="d0e3865"></a>At Castlecrag, I noticed at one time that one of the children was inclined to
                                       snitch things and I realized then that our suburban children had no orchards
                                       to raid, so I improvised a substitute by having always in my kitchen a case
                                       of fruit from which the children could help themselves. The doors to my
                                       house were never locked and the children had been taught not to knock but
                                       always to come right in. The news flew around and shocked mothers came to me
                                       to protest. But I insisted that the children in my house could do what I was
                                       willing they should do, and naturally the mothers didn't find it easy to
                                       keep the children away from my house. This experiment was very interesting,
                                       the attitude of no two children alike. Some were a bit ruthless at first,
                                       some very mannerly. One boy came every day <a name="105"></a> [Note: "after school" added in the
                                           N-YHS copy] and asked if he might get a drink of water, to which I
                                       replied, "Yes, and help yourself to an apple while you are there." Another
                                       small boy sent his wee sister in for two apples, but presently I suggested
                                       that brother come in for his own. It became an established institution and
                                       really was never abused. It satisfied the one in whose behalf I had started
                                       it, and never again was anything found missing from the house, though the
                                       children came in flocks like birds alighting on my lawn for pranks as they
                                       came and went. One day I came home to find the whole facade of my house
                                       (whose walls are rough stone with projecting stones here and there)
                                       ornamented with children from the ground to the roof, the babies on the
                                       lowest stones and the older children all the way up. 'Twas a great sight. To
                                       the children it was a great adventure. I am sure that many mothers' grown-up
                                       misunderstanding of children was

            <p><a name="d0e3909"></a>No more than I could endure to see "good" children could I endure to see
                                       stodgy young folk, industrious from a sense of duty and narrowly limited in
                                       their interests. Of course I had not been long established in No. 17
                                       Castlecrag before one of the rooms became a drafting room and soon one of
                                       our Melbourne draftsmen, Louisa Lightfoot, was brought up to work in Sydney
                                       and for a number of years she lived with me. She was a beautiful blond, a
                                       graduate in Architecture of the Melbourne University, a capable worker. I
                                       said to her, "Why don't you young things learn to dance, not just ball-room
                                       stuff, but real dancing." "I never thought of it," she said, with a faraway
                                       look in her eyes. Indeed having had the world for adventure, now a thing of
                                       the past, the one obligation of grown-ups to the young is continually to
                                       open to them the doors of other types of adventure. This is what is contrary
                                       to what we are doing these days. When children are 5 years old we put them
                                       in prisons calling them schools, and from that time on their lives are
                                       imprisoned within four walls. For the most part these prisons are hopelessly
                                       ugly, a fact which in itself is enough to destroy anyone's character. No
                                       wonder we find our young people lacking in initiative, sitting back waiting
                                       for someone to hand them a job, thinking the world owes them a living,
                                       lacking in capacity to create careers for themselves. Materialistic thinking
                                       leads to this too, for they assume that it is their parents who have chosen
                                       to bring them into the world whereas it is they who, many centuries back,
                                       have chosen their parents and, from the causal realms, brought them
                                       together. The physical scientists' reasoning that things just come about is
                                       as comical as Topsy's assertion that she had no father nor mother but "just
                                       growed."

            <p><a name="d0e3912"></a>Now, with the dance, Castlecrag came alive, a truly live spot in Australia,
                                       and always more and more alive though only a handful of people in the early
                                       days. A whole series of public and private activities developed covering the

                                       Mr. Edgar Herbert, an expert in physical education. He took us on, about a
                                       dozen all told, ranging from fourteen to forty, and the Castlecrag ballet
                                       was in full swing. Before long he brought along Mr. Burlekov, a stray
                                       getting his living as best he could by odd jobs of cabinet making, a left

                                       formerly of the Czar's ballet.

            <p><a name="d0e3942"></a>By the end of the first year we gave our first performance including a little
                                       play. I made a great hit dressed in my husband's dress suit. I had my hair
                                       cut and dressed man fashion for the occasion. All the ladies fell in love
                                       with me. Burlekov and Louisa startled the public with their skill in the
                                       Apache dance. From now on Louisa was taking the dance seriously. At our
                                       wonderful Castlecrag parties, attended by so many of Sydney's outstanding
                                       artists, the young folks arranged delightful programs. I always left the
                                       arrangement of the parties entirely in their hands. The combination of
                                       natural loveliness and beautiful architectural setting, constantly varied as
                                       one hostess after another offered her home, and the ingenuity of the
                                       citizenry in costuming, made beautiful and brilliant occasions of these
                                       community affairs none of which ever entailed any expensive outlay. Indeed
                                       my own knack at costuming was, I am convinced, the only faculty that ever
                                       won the real admiration of my husband who was constantly tickled pink to see
                                       the sumptuous and charming effects for unexpected guests or ourselves
                                       created from our stray sheets, table or couch covers and oddments that are
                                       always part of a home's stores. Indeed when Castlecrag, individually or in
                                       groups, entered the metropolitan affairs of Sydney, such as the annual
                                       Shakespeare Ball, they frequently walked off with the prizes.

                                       all the doors glazed so, whether open or shut, one glimpses ever new and
                                       charming pictures. The tapestries of the old world have no such value as
                                       these constantly occurring unforgettable living pictures. How wonderful if
                                       we all would learn how to live. It costs nothing but activity of heart and
                                       head and will.

                                       magnificent view across the harbor through the Heads to the Pacific Ocean.
                                       This dwelling, built of the local stone, stretches across the whole lot,
                                       vying with the Florentine palaces in dignity and charm. It was so lovely,
                                       lit up for the Christmas season, that we made daily walks down to the
                                       terrace below to look up to it and love it. Here, at one of the parties,
                                       there suddenly appeared at the seven French windows that open out to the
                                       lawn, seven Arab sheiks who swept in, took possession of the party and led
                                       the gaiety till three o'clock in the morning. Here, as at all the parties,
                                       all the arts were represented.

            <p><a name="d0e3998"></a>Each citizen of Castlecrag, stirred by the opportunities offered for self
                                       expression, could find no rest till his particular interest or faculty could
                                       take its place in the community life. So the ballet was supplemented by a
                                       dramatic club - The Dais - where plays were read, performed and written.
                                       This later launched the Haven Scenic Theatre in the valley. And there were
                                       other types of interests.

            <p><a name="d0e4020"></a>In the ballet, Louisa found her life work. For a while it merely filled her
                                       spare time. She built up a little class, where incidentally I broke my wrist
                                       practicing a Russian ballet, then established another in the city, Sydney,
                                       and later gave her whole time to it. Under her grew up the Australian Ballet
                                       taking a conspicuous place in the Metropolis. Louisa was no longer living
                                       with me. I had taken issue with her on one point and for several years our
                                       relations were purely formal. After one of her ballet concerts where the
                                       bon-ton of Sydney in full dress had rolled up in their cars and packed the
                                       hall, I went back stage to congratulate her. She met me as I entered with,
                                       "I owe it all to you, Mrs. Griffin, every bit of it; without you I would
                                       have had none of it." She knew she was a success and it was very fine of her
                                       to express herself so to me. I feel that it is very improper to expect
                                       gratitude from young people. This sort of feeling is not appropriate to
                                       youth and should not exist in them during their formative years. But it is
                                       fine when they look back later on and recognize where opportunities have
                                       been opened to them, and take the trouble to express their appreciation.

                                       where Mrs. Arundale, the wife of Bishop Arundale, of the Theosophical

                                       of Indian art. Louisa returned to Sydney and before long put on a marvelous
                                       production of "Le Dieu Bleu," a ceremonial Indian dance. She gave it in

            <p><a name="d0e4125"></a>The Unity of Life is divided into two phases - The Static and the Dynamic.
                                       The Static phase in all pervasive, is universal, is eternal and does not
                                       change. The Dynamic phase is likewise universal and eternal but, conjoined
                                       with the creative spirit, it changes with every process of nature.

                                       manifest, definitely and intimately make up the sum total of the experiences
                                       of a life in all its infinite variety, in all its operation through the
                                       field of its activity be it years, days, hours or untold aeons of time. They
                                       concern its birth, its adolescence, its flowering, its decadence, its death
                                       and its immortality. The Statics and Dynamics of an individual life are the
                                       quiet changeless mind and the ever-flowering, ever-flowing, ever moving,
                                       ever-changing action of the will, the heart, the soul, upon that mind.

            <p><a name="d0e4194"></a>City life seems to be inevitable. Man is a gregarious animal and loves his
                                       kind. But in this great land of open spaces gregariousness is overdone. One
                                       would think there was a limit to Australian soil to judge from our
                                       overcrowded and rather ugly cities, products of a tendency to follow in the
                                       gouty footsteps of John Bull, and a lack of imagination and artistic
                                       temperament which is truly British. When the climate and the open air life,
                                       combined with aggressive propaganda by the free spirits of today, have freed
                                       this budding Commonwealth from the grip of Mammon and the regime of the
                                       Philistine, we will begin to build a new civilization. This, of course, will
                                       call for new institutions. But first we must have new ideas, these are the
                                       ground-plan or the new Commonwealth, in which life will be lived as a fine
                                       art. Sounds Utopian, no doubt, to the matter-of-fact-mind, but sooner or
                                       later all of us will be Utopians. Even Columbus, who set out in a boat
                                       headed due west to seek the East Indies, was a utopian. But he arrived.

            <p><a name="d0e4197"></a>Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, is a kind of Columbus in his
                                       way. He has left the beaten track and launched out on the lonely waters,
                                       hoping to reach the city of his dreams some fine day. To drop the rather
                                       mixed metaphor, he has started to build a suburb by the shores of Sydney
                                       Harbor - out of ideas. It is true he will use solid stone and a certain
                                       amount of mortar and wood, and things material of that nature, but he
                                       depends for his effects on ideas. He is a kind of landscape architect - a
                                       painter of effects, in stone, and lime, and elevations. A British painter of
                                       genius was once asked how he mixed his paints. He replied - "With brains,
                                       sir." Mr. Griffin builds his model suburb with ideas. The stone and lime and
                                       other matters are of the earth, earthy; but the ideas are Mr. Griffin's own.
                                       With ideas he can demonstrate the triumph of mind over matter.

            <p><a name="d0e4225"></a>There is a certain American <a name="119"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] who, although he
                                       has artistic feeling, is really not an architect at all though he is quick
                                       on the uptake. He has never built a swastika building but is now adding that
                                       to his claims.

            <p><a name="d0e4231"></a>If I am not misinformed the swastika has been used in Europe. It is now being
                                       used in Australia in a group of tall apartment buildings. But "I want to be
                                       the lion too" in America is claiming it as his own and articles are being
                                       published to that effect though he has built no such building. He does not
                                       wait till he has originated or built a type to claim it. As soon as he
                                       learns of it he publishes claims. The public likes scandals. It is his
                                       scandals that have given him his public.

                                       structural qualities of knitlock, and his floor on the ground which let the
                                       moisture through because it was an imitation of the idea without any of the
                                       structural knowledge which makes such a method water proof. Griffin's
                                       federal enemies have kept this man posted re Griffin's work. Fortunately
                                       that generation will soon be dead and gone but the Griffin &amp;

            <p><a name="d0e4251"></a>artists, Dame Nature. The combination which has resulted in the suburb of
                                       Castlecrag is a combination of Nature and Art. The native flora is a thing
                                       of beauty, and can be a joy forever. The aim of our builder of beautiful
                                       homes is to make human habitations things of beauty, if not eternal joys;
                                       and it is certain that he has done something that stands out as unique in
                                       Australian history.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4254"></a>The dwellings in this new suburb are designed to harmonize with their natural
                                       surroundings. The roads of easy grade sweep along the bluffs, and flow in
                                       curves which please the eye. The houses are inconspicuous, in keeping with
                                       the natural harmonies. As the natural flora is restored the houses will
                                       nestle into place so that the slopes, as they arise from the water's edge,
                                       will be as completely garden as they were before being devastated by the
                                       hand of the vandal.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4257"></a>The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre. When each allotment is
                                       built upon, everyone will have a view of the stage and its setting, and in
                                       every direction the eye will encounter a garden, instead of a brick wall or
                                       an ugly fence. This effect is brought about also by the houses being placed
                                       so that they do not occupy a set building line, but are so placed that they
                                       conform to the general plan, which does away with all appearance of
                                       crowding, and almost entirely conceals the houses by trees, shrubs and
                                       climbers.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4260"></a>The flat roofs add to this garden effect. By degrees the splendid blossoming
                                       evergreen climbers, hardy in this climate, will cover or embower roofs as
                                       well as walls.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4263"></a>Viewed as a town planning effort, Castlecrag not only accepts and makes the
                                       most of natural surroundings, but meets all the needs of a human community.
                                       The homes are planned for the greatest economy for the occupier and the
                                       least inconvenience for the housekeeper, with the utmost in the way of aids
                                       to home life for old and young.

            <p><a name="d0e4289"></a>It is a great work, but it is only a beginning. It points to a new Australian
                                       life, based upon a new Australian idea. That idea is that it is absurd for
                                       Australians to keep following in the gouty footsteps of old John Bull or to
                                       ape Uncle Sam. They must think out a new civilization, and begin to draw up
                                       the ground plan of the new institutions. The idea may be summed up in a
                                       phrase; Life as a fine art. That is really what all the poets, the seers,
                                       the sages, the revolutionaries of the ages, have seen in their minds' eyes.
                                       It was the vision that Moses beheld from the Mount ere he passed behind the
                                       veil. Life as a fine art flourished on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea
                                       in days long fled; in lands where corn and wine abounded; where song and
                                       music and drama made life resplendent; where man surpassed himself and
                                       became superman - all this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the
                                       shores of the Pacific. Castlecrag is a step toward the Australian ideal - a
                                       new Civilization white in soul.

                                       stiff and fixed holding their position. A wind blown tree holds that
                                       appearance when there is no wind stirring. They make good compasses for the
                                       woodsmen who know their district as the bushmen always do. Australia's
                                       flora, the most ancient in the world, came up from the South Polar regions
                                       and has developed the most varied species each of which seems to have chosen
                                       its particular spot and considerately does not invade the others.

            <p><a name="d0e4342"></a>Along the edge of the sea we find these lovely Eucalyptus trees. Tasmania
                                       like the rest of Australia carries its forests on its rim. So back of these
                                       a bit we get into the depths of the bush where in spite of the fact that
                                       Australia has only an eighth as much timber as any other continent we find,
                                       as we do wherever white folks go, that they are cutting the heart out of the
                                       forest.

            <p><a name="d0e4345"></a>These trees illustrate a typical and wonderful fact about Australian trees
                                       that, though they give ample shade, rarely is the foliage so dense as to
                                       conceal the form and structure of the growth. This makes them ideal for
                                       architectural embellishment. The sad part is that <a name="123"></a> [Note: the] white man
                                       so rarely does his part, has so lost his touch with the spiritual, that he
                                       is not even conscious of his obligation to add beauty, destroying none, as
                                       his contribution to creation but everywhere what he does these days is
                                       hideous.

                                       almost to Broken Bay so complete that without the fortunate survival of

                                       character. It is only necessary to stand on some lookout such as Covecrag to
                                       be able to distinguish, from all the rest, primitive spots that are under

                                       to the public. Unfortunately the cases of personal protective interests are
                                       exceptional and even for these there are the hazards of bush fires,

                                       restoration of natural states has already been noticeable in Castlecrag with
                                       a resident community of about two dozen families only and, during the survey
                                       and construction work, many roads and streets as well as playing areas,
                                       baths, tennis courts and golf courses besides the quarrying and housing have

            <p><a name="d0e4434"></a>These operations have not appreciably silted up the coves because of the
                                       general contour alignment of the narrow roads, their early sealing and the
                                       drainage precautions taken wherever possible. The placing of the roads and
                                       the allocation of the home sites thus required complete contour surveys
                                       followed by detail personal feature studies in order to determine and to

                                       separate and screen the garden fronts in the same way and make private their
                                       street fronts. Thus, in addition to the site individually occupied by a
                                       self-selected owner, he has an interest through the local Parks Committee of
                                       each neighborhood in which the control of these areas will ultimately be
                                       vested. At present one Committee administers the Castlecrag Reserves,
                                       collecting 10 shillings per year provided for by covenant, from each
                                       abutting lot for the expenses of up-keep and improvement. Even now two
                                       thousand native trees and shrubs have been added to the district already
                                       occupied.

                                       held by the Government for public purposes, the land along the other shores
                                       has been cut into small parcels and utilized without protective covenants or
                                       direction; so that in the end we find the capital which is the pride of the

                                       and endure more discomfort than any other people in the world today in
                                       trying to enjoy outdoor nature: but holiday outings and week-end humpies
                                       comprise the least satisfactory and most extravagant way of gaining

                                       these encumbrances actually amount to only an eighth part of the land
                                       occupied, there should be no great difficulty in making them play a
                                       correspondingly subordinate part in the scheme already designed and executed
                                       by nature.

            <p><a name="d0e4652"></a>As Griffin's practice grew one of the first things he did was to work out a
                                       new form of partnership. It was especially important in Australia where
                                       class feelings create bad feeling and poor workmanship, but its form is
                                       equally important though in another way in America. For the transition from
                                       draftsman to independent practice is still difficult in America, the
                                       employer usually resenting his draftsman's not giving his full time and
                                       strength to his employer, and the breaking into independent practice without
                                       an established clientele is a very precarious step for the draftsman to
                                       take, frequently with only one client in view.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4655"></a>The unusual spirit in Griffin's office was conspicuous even to outsiders. I
                                       remember a member of a firm across the hall from us in Melbourne saying to
                                       me as I was leaving for home - "Your draftsmen seem never to go home." I
                                       replied, "Well I do my best to make them." "Yes," he said, "I know." In
                                       contrast was the remark of Mr. <a name="133"></a> [Note: Roy] Lippincott (a partner in the
                                       Griffin office) to a draftsman in an office he was sharing in Sydney in the
                                       early months in Australia, one who typically dawdled at his work and whose
                                       interest on Saturday was centered on the afternoon off. "If I had as little

                                       the conditions are worse for there they have the apprentice system which
                                       gives the apprentice little hope of any kind. In the Griffin office any
                                       draftsman who got a client was treated of a member of the firm. He kept his
                                       time card and continued to get his salary insofar as he worked for the
                                       office. On his own work he got the commission and was completely
                                       responsible. If he wished the help in any of the other architects he paid
                                       them on the basis of a sum established to meet that situation, a wage the
                                       same as his own. This did not affect the normal arrangements made between
                                       them as architect and draftsman, but it put younger members on sound ground
                                       while still inexperienced.

                                       an informal partnership with another <a name="137"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] of the
                                       Chicago school of architecture who had just started independent practice
                                       though he had in the mean time built several houses of no particular
                                       character, one half timber, etc. But now the influence of the Japanese, who
                                       had exhibited at Chicago's first World's Fair, was being felt among a number
                                       of the young Chicago architects. The first jobs turned out had been a flat
                                       building whose distinctive characteristic was a frieze almost identical with
                                       that of a building of Mr. <a name="138"></a> [Note: Louis H.] Sullivan's the founder of
                                       modern architecture. Another flat building was a semi court scheme 2 stories
                                       high. Its low hip roof and eaves were of the Japanese type. The third was a
                                       dwelling again with the low hip roof, its plan still the colonial
                                       parallelogram with center entrance and stairway hall. It did however
                                       establish a sill line for the 2nd story windows which carried

                                       had been under with Mr. Sullivan.

            <p><a name="d0e4744"></a>While this was going on I was told to make sketches for an abstract 2 story 3
                                       bed-room house which I did. This gave me an experience of why the Chinese
                                       tipped up the overhanging eaves though expressed in modern scientific terms
                                       of forces of gravity instead of demons - a reality in whatever terms
                                       expressed. I guess I was never a conformist. Any <a name="139"></a> [Note: Anyway?] it was
                                       a cruciform plan. Later on when I had left the office and Griffin was in
                                       partnership there an amazing thing happened. He told me one day several
                                       years later of his first experience there. A residential job had come into
                                       the office and the two men went into a competition for it. He mentioned the
                                       name of the client and I was wide-eyed thinking he was going to say he won
                                       it. Why otherwise should a man be telling me about it. But he said he lost,
                                       and I laughed and told him that house had been built exactly in accordance
                                       with my design - that first one. It was a revolutionary design, abandoning
                                       the universal parallelogram, T shaped, and center reception entrance hall
                                       dropped to ground level. His losing in that competition was doubtless a
                                       unique experience in that office. His revolutionizing of the work in that
                                       office was first expressed in the <a name="140"></a> [Note: Frank W.] Thomas House.

            <p><a name="d0e4753"></a>Later this architect went abroad. He asked me to take over the office for
                                       him. I refused. But after he had gone Mr. <a name="141"></a> [Note: Herman] von Holst who
                                       had taken over asked me to join him so I did on a definite arrangement that
                                       I should have control of the designing, that suited him. When the absent
                                       architect didn't bother to answer anything that was sent over to him the
                                       relations were broken and I entered into a partnership with von Holst and
                                       Fyfe. For that period I had great fun designing.

                                       period I too followed the Japanese feeling. It was not till a short time
                                       afterward, when I entered Griffin's office, that I realized the difference.

                                       frieze was almost a direct copy from this building of Sullivan's in whose
                                       office he had been trained. Throughout his practice it was he who followed
                                       others not they him. They were the creative ones. One wouldn't mind his
                                       taking up what inspired him but his claiming and publicity (made spicy by
                                       his scandals) stunned the movement, founded by Sullivan, in the United
                                       States for a quarter of a century.

            <p><a name="d0e4792"></a>He was quick on the uptake, naturally artistic but never an architect though
                                       he claimed the whole Chicago School of architects as his disciples. He spent
                                       most of his life writing articles making these claims and really was a
                                       blighting influence on the group of enthusiastic creative architects of his
                                       generation. Only a quarter of a century later has any creative architecture
                                       in the United States escaped the blight of his self-centered publicity.

                                       Louis Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was
                                       felt as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully there in the
                                       early decades. The successors vary in degree of creative power but they are
                                       not founders. Personal vanities and claims obstructed it here, especially
                                       the widely publicized braggadocio of one who did little but talked much.

                                       took place when landscape was made a part of architecture. It meant not only

                                       advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. And we must consider not the mere
                                       personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it
                                       is curiously true that a thing to be a real and permanent advantage to one
                                       must be an advantage to everyone, just as in the animal or man a sound organ
                                       is of vital importance to all the organs. Human society is an organism, and
                                       the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all since all are
                                       interdependent as root, branch, leaf and blossom of tree.

            <p><a name="d0e4875"></a>My first object lesson was the case of a house the working drawings of which
                                       had been completed, and accepted by the owner and the contract let when it
                                       was first subjected to the criticism from this fundamental stand-point, when
                                       Griffin entered into partnership with the architect <a name="151"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd
                                       Wright]. The lot was one next to a two-story flat building with its
                                       porch built close to the sidewalk line. Across the street from the flat
                                       building was a beautiful park. The house criticized was being set back on
                                       the lot as if shrinking from an ugly thing of which it was afraid, leaving
                                       the greater part of the grounds to the front, allowing the other building to
                                       look over it destroying its privacy and shutting off from the client the
                                       delightful view opposite, the home garden dominated by this ugly building.

            <p><a name="d0e4881"></a>A knowledge of the conditions of the surroundings led to the flat criticism
                                       that although the design was charming it was not the right answer, this was
                                       not the proper plan for the location, words which meant nothing to the
                                       designer who was only an architect, to whom town planning was a closed book.
                                       Griffin suggested that the living rooms be elevated above the eyes of the
                                       passer-by lifting the basement out of the ground, and that the house instead
                                       of being a parallelogram should be ell shaped, and that the whole building
                                       be

                                       alongside the flat building and so acting as a screen to the ugly mass
                                       thereby benefiting the whole avenue. This English basement type would make
                                       it high enough to conceal the flat building and would enable the projecting
                                       dining room to overlook the charming woods across the street, and also to
                                       get from dining room as well as living room windows a view of its own front
                                       garden, whilst the veranda and living room would attain privacy and look
                                       upon the graceful lines of the house itself instead of the ugly bulk of the
                                       adjacent building. Concentration of stair and service portions where no
                                       outlook was necessary was without any disadvantage. In other words, the
                                       special conditions called for a special type. The new arrangement was worked
                                       out, the house built accordingly, and a most charming home it is. At the
                                       same time the high class character of the street as a whole was restored by
                                       this screening of this blot on the landscape. The benefit to one was a
                                       benefit to all.

            <p><a name="d0e4892"></a>The ell-shaped form of this house established a new type in this office. On
                                       the whole in America as well as elsewhere a building, a residence, was a
                                       parallelogram. Nothing else was done. The Greek thinking had been back of
                                       this, a religious recognition of the 4th period of our present human cycle
                                       as the pyramid was the recognition of that 3rd, the Egyptian period. Once
                                       established the almost automatic thinking of our times flowed on in the same
                                       old groove. After all the mechanical is the idol of the present age so why
                                       not leave our minds to its tendency to work automatically. But this is the
                                       5th Period. The parallelogram no longer suffices.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4895"></a>Now this tradition was broken down. The plan was not necessarily a
                                       parallelogram and freer forms developed in this office to be carried on
                                       later when Griffin had a free hand in an endless variety of crystalline
                                       forms for he conceived of buildings not as facades but as three dimensional.
                                       Thus the creator thinks. We learn that there as many universes as there are
                                       crystalline forms, each created by a great primal Spirit of Mathematics.

            <p><a name="d0e4903"></a>Architecture is little understood at present. In the past it functioned
                                       through intuitive thinking guided by the Gods who do such marvelous things
                                       in forming nature. But now anyone who does a building is called an
                                       architect, <a name="152"></a> [Note: Le] Corbusier, for instance, who is simply an
                                       engineer. His packing-box structures are not architecture at all. The
                                       engineer considers nothing but the material facts and consequently is bound
                                       to the past and never really solves problems. Others are temperamentally
                                       painters of pictures as was the other partner in this office, a scene
                                       painter who, to get effects, used what structural knowledge he had to defy
                                       nature rather than to work with it, as extremes of overhanging cornices,
                                       etc., often a heavy drain on his client's pocket-books. One might call it
                                       clowning, it certainly is not architecture. The solving of such problems,
                                       which is the basic temperament of a real architect, accomplishes the
                                       graceful effects desired by roofing his building in accordance with the
                                       requirements of the plan. He does not limit himself to a particular type,
                                       say the hip roof, as was the custom of this office under the influence of
                                       the Japanese with whose art America was just then becoming acquainted. If
                                       conditions of plan call for corner windows, such can be roofed with the hip
                                       whose support to the eye is the wall or pier which thus is set far back from
                                       the corner of the building taking away the snub nose effect. If the plan
                                       develops solid corners the use of the gable, whose thrusts are thus taken in
                                       a way satisfactory to the eye, is desirable. The carrying up of the
                                       fenestration into the peak of the gable gives the esthetic satisfaction of
                                       purpose and richness. These things cannot, of course, be done by rule of
                                       thumb. Creative thinking may at any time find new solutions but one is not
                                       an architect unless the problem is solved.

                                       architectural history. How build such a huge structure, meet the
                                       requirements of its functions, and still have it a thing that satisfies the
                                       human soul making its life and development possible as food does for the
                                       body?

            <p><a name="d0e4929"></a>An analysis of the building's requirements showed that certain functions, as
                                       elevators, required no daylight so they were taken out of the bowels of the
                                       building and placed on the exterior walls forming impressive pylons. An
                                       interior court supplemented the external lighting and the massed exterior
                                       windows, treated as a unit, became a feature treated with consideration, and
                                       what is now called "modern architecture" was born. It took hold and swept
                                       the country only after the Tribune competition, some decades later, in which
                                       two architects who had won the two first prizes for the plan of Canberra,
                                       Griffin and <a name="156"></a> [Note: Eliel] Saarinen, presented two designs solving the
                                       problem of lighting which is the distinctive requirement of modern times,
                                       now perhaps passing with modern inventions in lighting, and which includes
                                       light for the streets as well as the fenestration of the building.

                                       the masses of fruits outvying the flowers in their long lasting
                                       conspicuousness, we find the barks putting on an equally amazing show. The
                                       Eucalyptus Urnigera is a case, its bark completely red, so fiery that paint
                                       cannot reproduce it. It was like a flame shooting up to meet the setting
                                       sun. In the nearby gully we see a pure white-barked Haemastoma called
                                       scribbly gum because always in its soft bark you find the writing of the
                                       fairies cut out be some slave insect of theirs to bring messages to the
                                       children of Australia to many of whom seeing the fairies comes quite
                                       naturally as it does to the Irish.

                                       naked. I am afraid she was a Mid-Victorian.

                                       bunches of solid green but the rich intermingling of colors in the barks, in
                                       the leaves and in the groups, and since it is the trees and shrubs that are
                                       the showy blossomers instead of the herbaceous plants as with us, all
                                       through the year the infinitely varied and subtle shades of the flowers add

                                       brought the loveliness of Middle Harbor within easy reach of the City of
                                       Sydney. In the early days it was served by fast modern motor buses running
                                       at short intervals to and from Wilson's Point. With the completion of the
                                       bridge it became only 20 minutes from the heart of the city.

            <p><a name="d0e4993"></a>Castlecrag, Covecrag and Castlecove are the picked portions of that mighty
                                       amphitheatre which stretches down to the rocky shores, wooded coves and
                                       charming inlets of Sydney's finest reach of water. Designed to preserve all
                                       the remarkable natural features - outlooks, cliffs, waterfalls, fern
                                       valleys, foreshores, birds and animals - the covenant under which all lots
                                       are sold and homes built enforces town ideals of suburban development
                                       entirely novel to Sydney, with landscape architecture which harmonizes with
                                       its exquisite setting. In its unspoiled grandeur Middle Harbor vies with the
                                       world-famous Riviera, Italian Lakes and Norwegian fiords.

                                       alienated and ruined. Seeking the pathway of least resistance, the City of
                                       Sydney has pushed its crowded suburban chessboards to the very portals of
                                       the great stone and wooded heights which look across the Harbor to French's
                                       Forest and Manly. Fortunately it has been halted there.

                                       and the sandstone substructure of these ledges affords the most elegant of
                                       all building materials. It also constitutes a district free of wind and
                                       dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water and above as to cooling
                                       currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most equable -
                                       even precluding frost - all the conditions for the best health. Castlecrag,
                                       four miles from Circular Quay, is named from towering rock. It has become a
                                       scenic Suburb which surpassed any other in the Commonwealth, and ninety
                                       aesthetic dwellings in stone have been planned or erected.

            <p><a name="d0e5050"></a>As the dominant motif throughout has been the preservation of nature,
                                       emphasis may be justly placed on the treasures so carefully conserved. The
                                       flora is diversified and rich, representing possibly the most multifarious
                                       collections in any country. Ironbarks, flowering gums, cypress pines,
                                       sheoaks, pink ti-trees, flannel flowers, waratahs, croweas, boronias,
                                       acacias, geebungs, wooden pear trees, scarlet bottle brushes, honeysuckles,
                                       grevillias and heather, brilliant masses of wild flowers - these are noted
                                       at random in a stroll through the trees. More than 500 choice native plants
                                       are yearly planted out from the nursery.

                                       ovals, narrowing in fiords - with yachts and other pleasure craft leaving
                                       tiny burnished wakes. In the distance is the ocean beyond Manly. Castlecrag
                                       looks down on Sailors Bay. Covecrag is above the main arm of the Harbor and
                                       Castlecove and Crag Cove sites <a name="163"></a> [Note: the reading here follows the N-YHS

            <p><a name="d0e5097"></a>A plan has been approved for a scenic Marine Drive which will skirt the
                                       foreshores between the Suspension Bridge and the Roseville Bridge when the
                                       roads are connected up. The round drive will give twenty-four miles of
                                       perfectly graded enduring surface. Superb examples of the skill of surveyor
                                       and landscape designer are afforded by the many highways through the vast
                                       estates. These have made easily accessible many heights and valleys which at
                                       first must have seemed shut off from human habitation. At Covecrag, for
                                       instance, there is a gently sloping ascent - top gear to any car - and on
                                       its summit the visitor can look down 330 sheer feet at a flawless panorama.

                                       vehicles, with every now and again a circular terminal way to serve as
                                       halting place or turning point. So cleverly inlaid are the roads that when
                                       looked at from above they have almost merged into the foliage through which
                                       they pass.

                                       services and utilities of all the homes are supplied from the rear of each,
                                       the roads are not disfigured by poles and wires nor is the splendid road
                                       surface continually dug up to provide conveniences for new homes.

                                       houses immediately abutting. The gratifying way in which these little

                                       reserves on that promontory have been given appropriate names - such as The
                                       Sortie Port and The Battlement in the case of Highways, and the Turret and
                                       Keep in the case of reserves. Other names suggest attractions peculiar to
                                       the areas. In the Gargoyle Reserve a rushing waterfall spouts out suddenly
                                       as it does in those old time fountains in which the mouth of a weird head
                                       serves as an outlet. Half a mile of creek frontage gives its title to the
                                       Watergate and a rockery lookout characterizes the Oriel. The Embrasure is
                                       surmounted by an overhanging ledge and forms a sheltered fern "loge" with a
                                       "parquet" playground, a waterfall and forest. Cool and restful the Retreat
                                       is the bed of a sylvan valley. Other reserves are distinguished by
                                       playgrounds, lookouts, pulpit rocks, grottos, cascades and glades.

                                       by a network of pathways, passes and shaded lanes. They are designed to
                                       perpetuate the delightful rambles which were a feature of Castlecrag before
                                       its development. An incalculable asset has been the segregation of four
                                       miles of water frontage, a common reserve to all the lot holders. Sports
                                       grounds, open air theatres, ovals, golf links, tennis courts, football
                                       grounds, etc. have been provided for by the wise foresight which has marked

                                       at Castlecrag and its roots go deeper every year. This has been partly due
                                       to the unifying and binding power of a common ideal, partly to the lead
                                       given by Mr. and Mrs. Griffin and the first house builders, and partly to

                                       with the landscape, they cannot fairly be compared with later handsome homes

                                       they served three most useful purposes. They proved the absolute suitability
                                       and beauty of the sandstone on the estate and justified its stipulation;
                                       they pointed the way to obtain the greatest possible living room view of
                                       harbor and forest; and they introduced wholly delightful labor saving

                                       fifths of the land on Castlecrag has been sold, and the vast majority of
                                       buyers intend to put up their own houses as quickly as possible. With the
                                       Harbor bridge built both suburbs have become closer than most North Shore
                                       resorts to Sydney and far closer in distance and time than other popular and

                                       successful - often beyond all expectation. The following are outstanding and

                                       judgment will be passed on Castlecrag and Covecrag.

                                       to build houses of wood. You can't drive a nail into these woods. But many
                                       of them are very beautiful for cabinet work. Though Australia has no such

                                       makes a wonderful show and everybody is out gathering gum tips for home

                                       everything is evergreen. The plant life of the world having originated about

                                       had established a new form of partnership. Any draftsman who had reached a
                                       point where a client had come to him did not have to work on the sly with
                                       them but could become a partner in the firm, using time and office and any
                                       assistance the other partners could give on equal terms, the time measured
                                       on the rate of &pound;7 a week. This safeguarded the quality of the output but the
                                       name of only the one partner was used on the particular job.

            <p><a name="d0e5322"></a>By the end of six years with the Federal Capital, when the plan was gazetted,
                                       i.e., no deviation could be made without an act of Parliament, Griffin's
                                       work was centering in New South Wales so he closed the Melbourne office and
                                       centered in Sydney. Pholiota that we had never thought of as a selling
                                       proposition was advertised one day and sold the next. When the owner's work
                                       called him to West Australia, Griffin released him from his contract. The
                                       house was advertised for sale and sold the next day.

                                       Nicholls. His story is remarkable too. As a blond youth just out of Manual
                                       Training school he dropped into the office looking for a job. A look at his
                                       lettering was enough for me, so I told him to come in again, I thought he
                                       could be useful to Mr. Griffin. "I think so," he said. He was. Nicholls was
                                       an exquisite draftsman. One day he was sitting out doors sketching the
                                       facade of the club house Griffin had done for the Chinese Quo Min Tang
                                           <a name="170"></a> [Note: Kuomintang] in Melbourne. An old man came along and watched
                                       him, recounting to him what great artists the Chinese were, etc., etc. He
                                       finally could not resist saying Mr. Griffin of the Federal Capital was the
                                       designer of this intriguing facade. Our latest client was Mr. Kanevsky
                                           <a name="171"></a> [Note: Nisson Leonard-Kanevsky], a Russian Jew, who had landed in

                                       street in the heart of Melbourne. When the day came for this deposit Griffin
                                       was out of town so I drew the money from the bank. Before the option was up
                                       he had sold it for &pound;2000 and used it to get an option on a site in the heart
                                       of the city one block from the central and only Railway station in
                                       Melbourne. Now he wanted to erect an office building on it. Would the
                                       Metropolitan Insurance Co. lend him the money for it. They would not.
                                       Sketches were proceeding in the office. He scoured around and came back with
                                       guaranteed tenants for all seven stories. The Insurance Co. assured him a
                                       solid sum. Mr. Abrahams, a wealthy money lender lent him enough more but at
                                       a very high rate of interest. The office was driving out the working
                                       drawings. Nicholls was established on the ground with a drafting table and
                                       stool and went up with the building. Everybody else in the office was too

            <p><a name="d0e5379"></a>Everybody on the building was on tenter hooks. The contractor fearing he had
                                       bid too low was trying to scrimp on the quality of the work, the money
                                       lenders scared they would lose all, everybody snarling at everybody but all
                                       centering around Nicholls. This infant sat there making detail drawings,
                                       settling every conflict, requiring everybody to live up to the letter of his
                                       undertakings, never ruffled and, at the end a perfect and perfectly finished
                                       building - a show building in Melbourne, the finest building yet constructed
                                       in Australia, and everybody his friend. What a thing it is to be born a
                                       Saturnian! Griffin had had a two years' fight with Melbourne's Municipal
                                       Council to get the drawings passed.

                                       in charge in Australia the first thing he did was to begin to collect back
                                       moneys due. Presently the list was closed and he wrote Griffin - "Is there
                                       anyone else that owes you money? If so send me the name and I'll clear it
                                       up."

            <p><a name="d0e5417"></a>Set back from the street only far enough to make a bouquet of everblooming
                                       ground cover and shrubs, and entrance to the garage, to circle round to the
                                       kitchen door along the lot line, and around to the other side of the garage
                                       to the front entrance, a loggia. Four massive piers form a loggia from which
                                       three French doors and two windows open into the house which really has no
                                       hall, but a circuit around the fireplace. This arrangement made it possible
                                       one stormy night to give the whole of the Christmas play in the house very
                                       effectively, a play which normally filled the whole Haven Valley with its
                                       shepherds and kings and angels. The audience sat on the floor along the east
                                       wall of the whole house.

            <p><a name="d0e5420"></a>Three steps down from the street level gives a lovely bank around the
                                       entrance way, the rest of the front being a tiny patch of lawn surrounded by
                                       all-evergreen tree and thicket shrubbery concealing the house completely
                                       from the street, a bower of loveliness throughout the year. Once, before the
                                       fig climber on the wall had grown so large, I came home to find the whole
                                       facade studded with children standing on the projecting stones of the rough
                                       local sandstone, the baby on a low stone, the other youngsters all over all
                                       the way up to the top. They gave me a good laughing welcome home.

                                       place, practically all native except some herbaceous annuals and perennials,
                                       mostly the latter. The young Eucalyptus in the corner of house and garage
                                       became in a few years a tall spreading tree, no menace to a house with a
                                       concrete roof and whose floor is built solid on the ground.

            <p><a name="d0e5470"></a>NATURE - In observing Nature we can see that she automatically obeys
                                       invariable laws which we study for inanimate things - physics and chemistry;
                                       for animate things - biology and instinct. And we can see that the result is
                                       invariably complete, perfect. It is physically reasonable to the intellect
                                       and to the higher senses ethically right and eminently fitting or beautiful.

            <p><a name="d0e5473"></a>ART - On the other hand natural manifestation through Man, called Art,
                                       depends upon man's limited perception of Law, Truth or the Spirit of Nature.

                                       of accumulated experience, his intellect which attempts to reason and on his
                                       emotions which feel for the ethic or the aesthetic, or often apparently on
                                       chance circumstance alone, in ignorance of the use of his faculties.
                                       Needless to say the result is always defective in one or more of the phases,
                                       never perfect.

            <p><a name="d0e5476"></a>ARCHITECTURE - Realizing that Nature's works may be perfect for their
                                       purposes, yet man has not sought to reach perfection by taking nature as a
                                       model. His problems are different and characteristic of him alone. With
                                       tools he augments his physical ability - he moves on wheels, he eats his
                                       food cooked, in society he attempts to institute justice in place of force
                                       such as he can see in vogue among the ants and bees, and for his shelter,
                                       instead of imitating trees, hives, gopher-holes or nests, he invents a
                                       unique house.

            <p><a name="d0e5479"></a>DESIGN - In creating then the things for his own house man is thrown upon his
                                       own resources and his training should involve a knowledge of man's progress
                                       up to his time, the logical power of deducing principles from those facts
                                       and the intuitive faculty of feeling rectitude, fitness, beauty. Our recent
                                       modern development has, beyond doubt, terribly slighted the last phase -
                                       this emotional creative perception, and the first steps in bringing Art
                                       nearer to Nature's degree of perfection. In other words to harmonize Art

                                       stone.) The test of the pudding is in the eating. Our life and the life of
                                       the community in this dwelling was proof to the hilt. The house filled the
                                       60' of the lot except for a 3' passage at either end. Every room but one had
                                       outlook to the valley view. One might call the house versatile since at
                                       various times it met perfectly totally different types of occupants - the
                                       normal type requiring 3 bed-rooms, ourselves requiring none, our successors
                                       using two bed-rooms. Perfect for each and all and on emergency tucking away
                                       for the night whoever might want to stay. With us there was no bed-room
                                       furniture. Box couches served for storing seasonal household things or
                                       dramatic supplies, these as well as the other things to Griffin's design;
                                       desks serving equally well as dressers, etc. The so-called maid's room was
                                       the office, the room opposite was the library, the 3rd bed-room was a music
                                       room to the South of the living room, the dining room to the North. The
                                       three formed one room. Endless cushions for use as well as beauty.

                                       for her purpose man could by selection and refinement make his own ideal,
                                       and a school of practitioners sprang up qualified, through knowledge of
                                       nature's traits and tricks, to displace the native designer. This
                                       unfortunate distinction persists especially in America without all the old
                                       difference to be sure. But while city parks are fashioned on the lines of
                                       the wild grove only to be profaned by the incongruous throngs, it is plain
                                       that we do not yet sufficiently appreciate that the proper study of mankind
                                       is man. Architects must broaden to cope with the design of grounds, streets,
                                       and city or countryside where man is involved. The present landscape
                                       gardener must make his scope include the building and its furniture, even to
                                       book covers and tea spoons, for creative work can accomplish results by
                                       subordination, not by division of responsibility.

                                       panel in the highway border, part of a tree lined avenue ornamented with
                                       such shrubs or plants in urns as are in feeling with the architecture. Walks
                                       or drives must be set to skirt the edges, near one or both sides, never to
                                       mutilate the panel with serpentine lines unless forced by natural obstacles.

                                       beauty of the harbor as they had never before. The house gave scale to the
                                       rest without disturbing it. At night with the moon rising, its wake in the
                                       water, the magic enchantment took you out beyond the limits of your skin.

                                       as rich a green and as dense a foliage as the fig but spangled with white
                                       blossoms which fill the gullies with perfume. A wonderful shrub to plant
                                       along the approaches to your home, offering such a sweet greeting to your
                                       guests.

                                       shaped, the dilwinnea, the pultenea and endless others. The bluffs are
                                       bedecked with blossoming shrubs throughout the year. One of the marvels in
                                       the spring is the Lily of the Valley tree, clusters of cream colored lily of
                                       the valley blossoms, and holding its Prussian blue berries through the rest
                                       of the year. Grouped with these was the delicate and graceful Eucalyptus
                                       Citriodora, the Lemon Scented Gum. Most delightful the fragrance and also
                                       healing. They are being used more and more medicinally.

            <p><a name="d0e5819"></a>With almost the first Christmas in Castlecrag, it became apparent that a
                                       little creative thinking was called for in the way of celebrating this most
                                       sacred festival. The people of Australia had already abandoned dealing with
                                       it as an indoor family gathering but, in taking to the outdoors on this
                                       universal midsummer holiday, it had entirely lost the feeling of a
                                       celebration with any significance. So, as there was as yet but a handful of
                                       children in Castlecrag itself, we decided to gather the youngsters of the
                                       environing district. To wipe out any possibility of hurt feelings, we sent
                                       out announcements that there would be an outdoor Christmas party to which
                                       all the children would be welcome, and suggested that parents desiring their
                                       children to take part should send a shilling for each child's present from
                                       the tree.

            <p><a name="d0e5879"></a>For several years we used the rock terraces and the interior reserve between
                                       and below two of the stone residences, and chose as the Christmas tree a
                                       Banksia Ericifolia growing on these rocks, and decorated it, frosted it by
                                       dipping the tips in water and then in flour, and hung festoons and balloons
                                       on the bushes round about, had Santa Claus, songs, bonfires and children's
                                       dances on the rocky terraces, dramatic tableaus, and ice cream for all. They
                                       were spectacularly beautiful. Every year the numbers attending increased
                                       till we had over a thousand and found the children were beginning to come
                                       from distant suburbs to which the fame of these parties had spread. Then,
                                       but not really because of the numbers, though that made a big task for the
                                       handful of Castlecraggers who had been in charge but because of the wrong
                                       spirit manifested from the first, but which we had hoped to dispel, a
                                       feeling which was one of those many evidences of the insidious consequences
                                       of the existence of classes in a community. For instead of the feeling of
                                       camaraderie and the wholesome give and take of people who gathered together
                                       on even terms, it was always apparent, and we realized the method we were
                                       using would not break it down, that Castlecrag was looked upon as an
                                       over-lord, an upper class from whom you got or grabbed all you could. There
                                       was indeed no Christmas feeling growing out of it but only the increasing of
                                       a feeling of class bitterness. Again we saw coming to the fore that
                                       dominating spirit in Australia of eagerness to get something for nothing,
                                       which is the inevitable outcome of the existence of classes, naturally, as
                                       the most honored are those who get without giving. It can't be otherwise in
                                       an Imperial system.

            <p><a name="d0e5890"></a>specimen of the New South Wales native Christmas bush - the Ceratophillum
                                       Cummiferum with its acrescent blossoms some changing from white through pink
                                       to red. So we put up a sign, - "Please preserve for the Christmas Party."
                                       But they mangled and stripped it just the same, perhaps with all the more
                                       gusto. We were having terrific struggle to preserve the native shrubbery for
                                       on the whole Australians think they are doing a service to humanity in
                                       destroying everything that God and the fairies have created and for anyone
                                       to try to preserve it labels them as belonging to a different class so we
                                       could not but feel that much of the depredation of the succeeding years was
                                       done in malice though of course we knew that much was carelessness. Once we
                                       watched a man on the crest of the next promontory and 12 fires followed in
                                       his wake. No use to try to catch him. He would be gone before we could
                                       possibly get there even by car. Nor on the whole would it be wise to try to
                                       punish anything of this sort or the whole community back of us would join
                                       burning us up. So fifteen years have been spent in diplomacy, in chasing and
                                       talking with the private individuals who passed through, for our
                                       promontories really serve as a national park for the packed districts beyond
                                       our boundary line.

            <p><a name="d0e5893"></a>It has made a difference bit by bit in those years during which we nearly ran
                                       our legs off and fought fires till our hearts refused to function. Indeed
                                       Griffin gave his life to the preservation of those beautiful Middle Harbor
                                       promontories for one night after putting out a fire he stepped, in the pitch
                                       dark, over a precipice and fell on a rock his full weight on his right ribs
                                       and was put to bed for two weeks. Some time later he suddenly was caught
                                       with excruciating agony for which the doctors could get no clue for by every
                                       test he was a perfectly well man. The pain was just where the blow had
                                       struck and when they came to find if I had any clue I told them what I
                                       thought must be the cause. They operated and found a ruptured bladder

                                       would be preserved even after occupation which was difficult for them to
                                       comprehend since in the occupied districts all of the natural bush had been
                                       destroyed. In Willoughby, of the whole forest, not a tree remained. It was a
                                       weird idea to them but by the time the next generation came along it was
                                       easier for them to understand and now the streams of people that go through
                                       every week rarely have any flowers or branches in their hands. The ones who
                                       come to gather dead wood still set fires to replenish their supplies but at

                                       increasing interest in the native flora, and our citizenry has increased so
                                       that on the whole fires are early reported and quickly put out.

                                       resources had supplied the whole of Willoughby with timber and firewood and
                                       building stone and sand and soil till it was stripped bare. One could see
                                       why a people trained to think it was man's right to get things for nothing
                                       would be resentful of anyone's coming in and presuming to prevent their

                                       planting hundreds of seedlings, it is beginning to vie with the lower
                                       terraces in loveliness. No wonder the fairies occasionally show themselves
                                       to Castlecrag children.

                                       which certain elements in the community get advantages arising purely from
                                       their positions. However different it may have been in ancient times, in the
                                       present time there is no service rendered as an equivalent for such
                                       privilege. Today titles are usually given or at any rate offered as bribes
                                       to play the game with officialdom. Then there truly arises a working <u>class</u> (in contradistinction to an upper class) who feel
                                       greater and greater bitterness that they have to work for what they get
                                       while the most honored and respected elements in the community are heaped
                                       with benefits for which they give nothing in return. As this feeling was
                                       deeply repugnant to us the Christmas parties were abandoned. Of course one
                                       finds snobbery in America as well as elsewhere but it has no significance.
                                       It has no power.

            <p><a name="d0e6007"></a>Again in the Progress Association, we had a similar experience though we
                                       never gave up the fight there and now after some fifteen years have to a
                                       certain extent broken it down in connection with ourselves. The mere fact
                                       that Griffin was controlling the development of a considerable area, and
                                       that it was apparent from the beginning that he was developing it on lines
                                       that would prevent it from becoming a slum, to our surprise, was like waving
                                       a red flag before a bull. The covenant did not require expensive houses,
                                       indeed several of them cut under the cost of the usual slummy types, but
                                       they were all beautiful and harmonious with the local materials and colors.

                                       because of lack of sufficient population and could not form a municipality
                                       of our own, though our area was sufficient, there were some of the essential
                                       things which we had to submit to the Willoughby Council. For, although we
                                       paid for the construction of our roads in this 700 acreage, there were

                                       citizenry inaugurated a Progress Association to include a considerable area
                                       already thickly settled, extending West to the north and south thoroughfare
                                       - High Street.

            <p><a name="d0e6024"></a>These meetings of the Progress Association were a curious experience to us in
                                       those early days. A fair number rolled up to the meetings which promptly
                                       developed into a real one-sided class war for the mere fact that men lived
                                       in our part where pleasant and sightly houses were being built and where
                                       every pain was being taken to preserve instead of destroy the native bush,
                                       meant that whatever was suggested was looked upon with suspicion and fought
                                       by those who considered themselves as "working class people." You see in
                                       America people don't look upon themselves as "working class people."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6027"></a>These self-styled working class people did not think of themselves simply as
                                       citizens of the district with common needs for paved thoroughfares, electric
                                       lighting, sidewalks, gas supply, transportation, etc., but continually
                                       complained that it was always Castlecraggers who were given the official
                                       positions as if their interests were different from ours. They threatened to
                                       pack the meetings for elections to which we of course replied - "Go ahead;
                                       bring as many members as you wish, the more the better. That's just what we
                                       want. Get your majority and use it to select whomsoever you please." But
                                       that never happened. One might say only the rambunctious, fiery individuals
                                       would come to the meetings at all. Our persistence, however, during fifteen
                                       years has made the Association effective in bringing about various
                                       improvements advantageous to everyone in the community, such as the
                                       completion of a new North and South thoroughfare (to which Griffin dedicated
                                       free of cost 200 feet of Castlecrag frontage, the Eastern Valley Highway,
                                       which will enormously improve transportation facilities for the whole
                                       district. The Association continue to function for the district and the
                                       class feeling is not

            <p><a name="d0e6066"></a>Another instance, but significant, was amusingly illustrated by a minister
                                       who, each week-end almost, for a long time used to bring friends of his up
                                       to see what was going on and always stood for a while in front of our house
                                       to dilate in loud tones so that we would be sure to hear, on the absurdity
                                       of such a building. His profession gave him great versatility and
                                       picturesqueness in these diatribes. Of course, to us it was apparent that he
                                       must have found our buildings very interesting or he would not be coming to
                                       see them over and over again. About two years later after a lapse of his
                                       visits, he came again with a group of his friends and, being in the yard
                                       myself, I asked them if they would not like to come in and see the house
                                       from the inside. So in they came and I showed them around. He said to me
                                       that he used to come to see these houses and didn't like them at all but
                                       somehow he had grown to like them, which I explained to him by saying we
                                       quite understood that anything different was always a shock to the human
                                       mind and in our business, which was pioneering, we took that for granted but
                                       we realized also that if a thing was the right answer to a problem it was
                                       not long before the people realized that and began to approve.

                                       they visited England. She did not like it. But one of her rich friends when

                                       she liked the way they treated Australians. She said - "O! They didn't know
                                       I was an Australian." She had managed to conceal that fact. I asked her how

            <p><a name="d0e6101"></a>A little incident happened to me once in the early days which gave me, an
                                       American, a great shock. I had been introduced in her shop to a woman who
                                       was a florist, by a friend of hers and had gone to her shop and had chatted
                                       with her on various occasions. One Sunday, as Mr. Griffin and I were taking
                                       a walk through the botanical gardens, I saw her coming toward us and I am
                                       sure she saw us but, as she came nearer, she turned away and didn't look at
                                       us. I could see that it was deliberate and realized that she, a shop keeper,
                                       looked upon herself as belonging to an inferior class, resented it but
                                       didn't take the risk of bowing to us and being snubbed by our not returning
                                       her greeting.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6104"></a>I met so many people at Castlecrag that I made a habit of bowing to most of
                                       the passers by. But no friendly return greeting unless there had been a
                                       formal introduction. But I preferred that to the risk of appearing to snub
                                       someone I had met. - Typically British! Class! I had found that even in
                                       Australia, which is supposed to be democratic, it was quite the custom for
                                       people to manifest their own feeling of superiority by such snubs. I
                                       experienced it once myself. I had met Lady Somebody-or-other at a garden
                                       party in Adelaide at the time of a Town Planning Convention. Some time
                                       later, in Sydney, as I was waiting for the elevator to go up to the office,
                                       a group of women came in, amongst them this "lady." I felt quite proud of
                                       myself that I remembered her and bowed. I got nothing in return but a cold
                                       and stony stare. I was amused inside realizing that one would naturally
                                       conclude that a woman in an office building at nine in the morning would
                                       usually be a stenographer and that I was being put in my place.

                                       proprieties which are the foundation of British Imperialism. An American
                                       takes these things with a laugh but they embitter the souls of the people
                                       who are "subjects."

                                       America as anywhere else but Americans don't know the meaning of the word -
                                       it lies outside their experience. There is a natural difference of interest
                                       in the Economic Realm between manual labor and spiritual labor, each
                                       wanting, naturally to get the other's products as cheaply as possible but
                                       this is a thing that can be handled if the Political and Economic
                                       Organizations are two separate things. It has no connection with class as it
                                       exists today.

                                       Europeanizing of America that has been going on since the beginning of the
                                       last war is a heartbreaking thing to witness when one sees, as one who has
                                       had the double experience can see, that the European system is a soul

            <p><a name="d0e6158"></a>The fact is that Australians are quite as European as the Europeans and the
                                       antagonism between classes is really bitter. The consequence of this is that
                                       the ideal over there is quite different from the ideal in America. It is to
                                       put themselves on even terms with the most respected element, those who do
                                       nothing and get everything. Their ambition for themselves is, not to work
                                       but to get as much as possible for nothing. Whereas in America, so far as my
                                       experience has gone, the ideal is to achieve, to do work, to give quid

                                       interests, no enthusiasm, the result of which is that the community on the
                                       whole turns to gambling, the only spice to add to the pure physical comfort
                                       so easy to attain in that wonderful continent and climate of Australia.

                                           Matthews?], a supporter of the Labor Party, who was sent by them
                                       for a six months' investigation in the United States. I had continually
                                       stressed with her the fact that many of the measures being taken, all of
                                       them supported by the Labor Party, some of which were being put into effect
                                       by the opposing party, were having a disastrous effect on the character of
                                       the people. I told her how we felt that the turning of charitable work over
                                       to the government was destroying the soul of the people, was hardening their
                                       hearts, and though there is still much private charity work done, the effect
                                       on the attitude of the people as a whole was very apparent to us, coming in
                                       from the outside. Why should anyone do anything for anybody? Let the
                                       government do it.

                                       minimum wage had brought about an attitude which discouraged all interest in
                                       training oneself for high skill achievement so that it was practically
                                       impossible in Australia to get skilled labor. Why bother to train yourself
                                       when a wharf laborer would either get as much pay as a skilled laborer or

                                       the job? One was a fool to work hard when the loafer got just as much pay
                                       and was just as sure of holding his job. I called her attention to the
                                       desperate position of the architect for instance who could not get work done
                                       on his buildings either swiftly or well for if anyone showed any signs of
                                       superiority he was discredited by his fellows, and if you dismissed a man
                                       for inefficiency, the next man made certain that he was equally inefficient.

            <p><a name="d0e6218"></a>She could not see these things and during a time after her return I was very
                                       cross with her when I learned that she had been trying to instill the same
                                       ideas into Americans she had met, the general line of her argument to them
                                       being - "Why not get your government to do this? It's your money." And on
                                       her return she was still putting up the same arguments. But before six
                                       months had passed after her return she came to me and said that only after
                                       coming back and witnessing the attitude and spirit in Australia in the light
                                       of her new experiences had she come to realize that what I had been saying
                                       was true. There was no such spirit in Australia as she had encountered in
                                       America and she could now see how the differences in the system were the
                                       cause of this soul destruction.

                                       few that you can nibble at, very tiny and almost tasteless. Most all the
                                       fruits are wooden, a riot of shapes, weird often animal like or hobgoblin
                                       shaped, and there is quite a business of using them in combinations to make
                                       weird creatures for sale as curiosities. The wooden pear is one of the
                                       largest. You see there were no human beings on earth at that time to need
                                       the fruits of the earth for their maintenance. The plants who do not need
                                       food but transform minerals into food did not at that time have to concern
                                       themselves with charity for human beings. And only later when certain
                                       strange animals developed, all of them vegetarians, did they manage to live
                                       on this strange plant life so stiff and hard and heavy with oil that no
                                       stranger could possibly eat them.

            <p><a name="d0e6283"></a>In his Town planning work Griffin would never allow the surveyors to follow
                                       the custom of putting the district to the fire nor cutting swathes through
                                       the trees no matter what their majesty. He made this requirement of the men
                                       surveying Port Stephens. Then he was up there he made the acquaintance of
                                       King Billy, an aboriginal who worked with the surveyors. Finding Griffin
                                       sympathetic King Billy talked freely with him and gave him much interesting
                                       information about the native plants. Through him Griffin learned how precise
                                       was their knowledge for King Billy could identify at a distance even a dead
                                       tree. The aboriginals were interested, as Griffin was, in the character of
                                       the form rather than in the minute distinctions which the botanists as a
                                       whole center on which in fact gives them the ability to attach names but
                                       does not give them real knowledge of the plants they are listing.

            <p><a name="d0e6286"></a>When Griffin asked him what he thought about the surveyors' setting fire to
                                       the bush before they surveyed it he said - "That is because they are
                                       cowards. They have no right to do this because it belongs to the birds and
                                       the animals as much as it does to them." The surveyors wore heavy leggings.
                                       King Billy went bare legged through the bush and had no fear.

                                       open minded, would lead us on to the investigating and mastering of that

                                       rational thinking in these modern times. The 19th Century transformed the
                                       thinking of European peoples. It is not too much to ask that the 20th
                                       century accomplish as much. With 45 of its years gone this transformation is
                                       overdue.

            <p><a name="d0e6309"></a>I stood in the sun in an open doorway. In moving my arm I noticed that as the
                                       shadow on the floor approached the shadow of the door jamb a great lump,
                                       almost the size of my fist, lifted up on the shadow of the arm and reached
                                       out contacting a similar lump approaching it from the door jamb. I have
                                       asked many materialists to find an explanation of that but I think the
                                       answer will never come from that source. In an astronomical account of the
                                       observations of a recent transit of Venus great preparations had been made
                                       to note from various strategic points of the world the exact moment of the
                                       contact of the edge of Venus with the edge of the Sun. Such data would be
                                       used for important undertakings in the starry realms. But, the author said,
                                       unfortunately as the moment drew near a dark nexus developed which made it
                                       impossible to observe the exact moment of contact of the two circumferences.
                                       They hoped for better luck next time. My observations would lead me to
                                       conclude that what had happened between the darkness of Venus as seen from
                                       the Earth and the darkness beyond the Sun was exactly what happened between
                                       the shadow of my arm and the shadow of the door jamb and would always
                                       happen.

            <p><a name="d0e6312"></a>From spiritual science known intuitively to primitive peoples we can learn
                                       that light is not a mode of motion and that darkness is not a negative thing
                                       - the absence of light, a fact that is obvious to anyone who stops to think
                                       for we can see darkness and it is not possible to perceive nothingness. Now
                                       in substances this phenomenon is quite well

                                       conclusion of such an experience would be that darkness, far from being
                                       nothingness, is substance and subject to the laws of substance. Attraction
                                       caused the nexus.

            <p><a name="d0e6329"></a>"Whilst no one would predict for the Darwin area a future comparable with
                                       that of the more favored northeast coast of Queensland, there certainly
                                       exists here a vast field for development, and so far nothing has been done
                                       about it. The richly timbered Cairns hinterland is immeasurably more fertile
                                       and suffers no long dry spell between copious downfalls in the wet season as
                                       does the Darwin back-country, but the areas along the northern rivers are
                                       capable of growing most tropical products. Many there are who argue that to
                                       enter that field means we cannot compete with Eastern countries with their
                                       supply of cheap labor, our white Australia policy forbidding the employment
                                       of the colored races. One indelible fact is therein lost sight of. A colored
                                       people exists there already and unless the white Australia advocates mean to
                                       exterminate it with fire and sword, always will. The ground is so productive
                                       that the aborigine can have a varied vegetable diet without cultivation of
                                       any kind and once he is shown how easy it is to secure a far higher standard
                                       of living by a little preparation of the land he will respond and that in
                                       spite of all that has ever been written about his shiftlessness and
                                       indolence. Indolence! The spectacle of hundreds of our indigent whites
                                       preferring to sit down on the dole when votes are taken regarding relief
                                       work proves that indolence is no matter of color after all. Intelligence and
                                       patience will be needed but the black fellow can be trained to be a useful
                                       citizen."

                                       was with their fingers crossed as became apparent later. For the Councils

                                       rates that the owners of this land are paying is all being expended in road

                                       and deep holes, and only after three years pleading would they consent to
                                       construct this, though the way was lined with houses on either side, but
                                       only on our advancing taxes to cover the total cost of this street not on
                                       our estate. The rest of Edinburgh Road is still unpaved. Castlecrag is on
                                       its south-eastern side. The village of some 50 families on beyond us goes on
                                       deputizing the Council for pavement, or electricity or gas as it has been

                                       had given their approval in the beginning, there began a systematic delay of
                                       final acceptance of subdivisions which, since no title could be passed and
                                       no building constructed until the streets were approved and received a
                                       department number, had a most destructive effect on the carrying out of
                                       Castlecrag. A fence was required here and when built, after another long
                                       delay, an alteration of a gutter was required there, and when this was done
                                       something else somewhere else; in some case three or even more years
                                       elapsing before approval was given. This was accompanied by a systematic
                                       campaign of defamation. Reports of the bankruptcy of the company were spread
                                       broadcast. Every sort of lie was spread such as - one was not allowed to do
                                       this that or the other; one had to be a vegetarian; one could not plant a
                                       tree; - nothing was too outlandish to be broadcast and believed.

            <p><a name="d0e6400"></a>The district immediately adjacent was deeply insulted by the fact that houses
                                       different from their own were being built and spread all sorts of statements
                                       they would take their oath to:- that they were extravagantly expensive, that
                                       one couldn't live in them without becoming ill, etc., etc. They also came
                                       through in great numbers and ring-barked the trees. If they found one such
                                       bandaged in hopes of its surviving they tore off the bandage. When trees

            <p><a name="d0e6496"></a>This is usually thought of as a warm climate but real discomfort comes not
                                       only from the cold during the four months of winter when the whole community
                                       rich and poor suffer intense discomfort in the houses, but frequently during
                                       the other seasons. With one voice all who come from other climates say they
                                       have never suffered with the cold in their lives as they do in Australia.
                                       The solution to this, removing all the discomfort of the climate, is a
                                       simple device used by the aboriginals - to take advantage of the much lesser
                                       range of the temperature of the ground, at least 20 degrees less than that
                                       of the air. This is practically all that is needed in this wonderful climate
                                       to make living comfortable. With doors and windows closed on nippy days the
                                       warmth of the earth comes up and fills the whole house and on the coldest
                                       days a bit of a fire in the fireplace with a warm floor for a start and the
                                       whole house is right. Such a little thing and a whole civilization can be
                                       transformed, but do you suppose a Municipal Council would permit it? By no
                                       means. The case was put, the reasons given, but reason doesn't interest
                                       councilors. It wasn't done and that's final. The gods helped us by sending
                                       the Bubonic plague to Australia. So we were permitted to build rat-proof
                                       houses.

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6544"></a>There are so many interesting things to talk about in the Leo Parer's house
                                       on Sydney Harbor that it is rather difficult to know where to begin. For
                                       instance there is the famous Parer family with its ancestral dash of
                                       adventurers' Spanish blood. Then there is the architecture of Burley Griffin
                                       always an interesting topic in which tradition the house itself has been
                                       designed. And lastly there is the beautiful locality itself which at first
                                       glance seems just the same as it always was, and yet not the same. Its leafy
                                       frontages have been invaded by a certain amount of new building. A lovely
                                       roadway winds its tree-shaded way along the water's edge, unrolling at each
                                       turn its always fresh pictures of blue water, framed between Middle and
                                       South Heads, with a spreading expense of ocean beyond.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6547"></a>The front door is unadorned by porch or portico, its only emphasis being a
                                       heavy flat stone lintel projecting from the wall immediately above. Directly
                                       above the lintel is the long narrow staircase window which carries the
                                       vertical line of the door above the roof line. There are few windows on this
                                       side of the house so that the effect of the staircase window is unspoiled.
                                       Its simple upward sweep has a dramatic quality which seems to impart life
                                       and vitality to what would otherwise be a rather heavy brick wall.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6550"></a>On the bed room floor a large square landing over the main hall opens out on
                                       the sun deck above the loggia. The bedrooms are grouped on either side, most
                                       of them having windows facing the harbor. Each bedroom is provided with
                                       built-in clothes cupboards with trays and hanging space.

                                       Sydney.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6597"></a>Viewed as a whole the house is a highly stylized individual composition which
                                       shows off with fine effect a flair for handling masses of material. There is
                                       evidence of a free play of imagination, an unexpectedness of grouping at
                                       certain points which, combined with the intensification of wall texture by
                                       the use of raked cream bricks, invests the whole building with a quality of
                                       vivid, graceful aliveness. This is notably apparent in the chimney treatment
                                       on the south side of the house.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6600"></a>The plan grew into being as a natural development of the possibilities of the
                                       site adapted to the needs of the family. The utmost use has been made of the
                                       view over the harbor and consequently the front door opens into what is
                                       really a rear entrance corridor beyond which a large square main hall opens
                                       out onto the loggia. The staircase has a hall all to itself opening from the
                                       rear corridor.

                                       communicate with a small study with windows facing the back garden which can
                                       be made part of the lounge if desired.

                                       water. Its short pillars support an equally huge open sun deck reached from
                                       the bedroom above. Then beneath this, for the site of the house slopes
                                       steeply down to the water, excavation has been made for the building of a
                                       ball room across the entire front of the house. The ball room is to be
                                       finished after the war, in time for the children who will then be grown up.
                                       Meanwhile the excavation is concealed behind an imposing row of pillars, the
                                       effect of which already gives some idea of what the future ball room will
                                       look like with wide glass doors opening direct into a dusky-scented garden
                                       bathed by some future Sydney moon.

            <p><a name="d0e6703"></a>If one starts right it is not a difficult thing to do. And starting right
                                       means solving the problem before starting the construction. Getting in the
                                       habit of doing this brings one into touch with the source of information
                                       before the solving of the wider problems, for there are natural laws in the
                                       spiritual realm as there are in the material realm, and humans can learn
                                       them and work in accord with them if they are inclined toward construction
                                       or contrary to them if they are bent on destruction.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6706"></a>In our profession starting right means control of the land which makes town
                                       planning possible. Well these conditions held at Canberra, Australia's
                                       capital, but the control was political so that was no good, although it did
                                       make possible the establishing of the ground plan though it was a terrific
                                       fight and much money was wasted.

                                       Sydney, three promontories rising to 330 feet above the water level, five
                                       miles of water frontage, a climate perfect the year around, never a frost,
                                       and in the midsummer never a hot night. A perfect summer resort and a

                                       a lovely coolness reigns. And not the desert of our idolized California but
                                       the most perfect work of the Creator, a perfectly balanced garden, trees and
                                       shrubs all evergreen, most of them with showy blossoms, some blooming for
                                       nine months of the year; and nothing in the nature of a weed.

            <p><a name="d0e6743"></a>When the theatre was being planned Griffin said to the owners - "What a
                                       marvelous thing it would be if we could build a theatre like a crystal
                                       cave." The idea revolved in his mind, and inquiries were made in Belgium
                                       into the possibility or cutting crystal or glass to give effect to the idea.
                                       The cost was estimated to be in the vicinity of &pound;600,000 and was rejected.

            <p><a name="d0e6746"></a>But Griffin clung to his dream and finally carried it out in fibrous plaster,
                                       like the old triangular crystal with the drop removed.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6749"></a>Inside each V shaped box, highly ornamented, he arranged rows of lights
                                       representing all the primary colors of the spectrum. From a master switch
                                       the lighting is slowly changed so that the whole effect is that of the
                                       varying color changes of a revolving piece of crystal.

            <p><a name="d0e6752"></a>Griffin carried out his motif throughout the theatre. Thus the Capitol

                                       theatres in the world and a fascinating study for architects.

                                       emphasize this for they too are different from anything seen elsewhere. They
                                       are a part of the landscape, harmonious with it in material, color and form.

                                       the spectacular outlook spots to the magnificent views across the harbor
                                       through the Heads to the Pacific are thrown into permanent reserves for
                                       access to all and how the lovely trees are carefully preserved even if it
                                       takes two or three revisions of the surveys to accomplish it without
                                       injuring the perfect grades for motor traffic that prevail throughout these
                                       steep and precipitous terraced formations of Castlecrag. But if you love
                                       nature she yields herself to you, and these terraces in the end, after the
                                       roads have been built, seem have been created for the very purpose of ideal
                                       human habitation.

                                       at Castlecrag. For as you stand on the heights and look over the valleys it
                                       will always be all garden and the brightest spots in the garden the roofs of
                                       the houses for they are made of reinforced concrete and can be covered with
                                       eight inches of soil and planted with lawns for games or with the most
                                       cherished flowers of all. These roof gardens! They make one feel suddenly
                                       bigger, make one grow bigger, for one commands the whole panorama and in the
                                       home which is one's own he realizes that the whole world is his. He commands
                                       it to the very horizon, and this without infringing on the equal rights of
                                       every other citizen to do the same, utterly unconscious of others as they
                                       are of him.

            <p><a name="d0e6829"></a>To accomplish this means the solving of many problems but when all the means
                                       for solving the problem are in the enterpriser's hands it becomes possible,
                                       one might almost say easy such is the joy of it. The buildings are
                                       constructed of the local stone, in this case an ideal building sandstone,
                                       easy to cut and glazing afterward, sometimes pure white at others buff or
                                       pink or brown so that if one does catch a glimpse of them as may happen,
                                       especially when first constructed, though often with the native garden so
                                       luxuriant and always preserved it is impossible even from the beginning to
                                       get a photograph from any point, the house appears only as a bit of a garden
                                       feature or a bit of the natural rockery. And so built the house is no longer
                                       an enemy of the garden but is on friendly terms, intimate terms, with it
                                       encouraging the familiarities of bush and climber and without the fear of

                                       the Earth, is respect for the works of the Creator. Through spiritual
                                       knowledge we are aware that the North is the body of the Christ since the
                                       event of Golgotha, and that the ethers which

            <p><a name="d0e6853"></a>One can walk right around the fireplace. Sometimes it serves as a partition
                                       between the living room and an entrance lobby, or perhaps to screen the way
                                       to bed rooms and kitchen. Sometimes it carries recesses for books or china
                                       or perhaps its "face" may be entirely plain according to the style of the
                                       room. But in all Burley Griffin's houses it is a commanding feature. We took
                                       a photograph of one of these chimneys. The face of this particular chimney
                                       was not absolutely plain, but had two small three-cornered glass cupboards
                                       built out from it. So narrow was the supporting frame-work of these
                                       cupboards that they appeared to be completely of glass, magically resting on
                                       the stone chimney front.

            <p><a name="d0e6856"></a>The photography was a joyous business. Everyone took a hand, suggesting this
                                       or arranging that (for people who live at Castlecrag are a happy colony for
                                       a common artistic interest which, without being in the least bit "posey" or
                                       unnatural, delightfully enriches ordinary friendly intercourse), and when we
                                       thought we had got it about right and were just going to shoot, there was a
                                       stir in the doorway and in came Burley Griffin himself, his rosy cheeks
                                       wreathed in smiles but his blue eyes alight with purpose nevertheless.

                                       near the precipice of the terrace below, all the homes are grouped around
                                       interior reserves giving space for play and festival, grove and garden. No
                                       child is ever naughty at Castlecrag, anyhow I never saw one. There is too
                                       much to do. And the pale lilies that come in from outside turn to roses
                                       though they are really just as close together as before but they don't know
                                       it. The dwellings staggered so that you look into the neighboring gardens
                                       and feel them as part of your own, unconscious of the buildings or
                                       boundaries.

            <p><a name="d0e6885"></a>Then what happens when the people are really living there? Well the Mrs. has
                                       something to say to that for she had been saying for years that she was bent
                                       on starting a civilization in which children could be happy and had been
                                       assuring her angel that she was willing to pay whatever price was necessary
                                       to accomplish that end. With the happiness of adults we need not concern
                                       ourselves. That is their own affair and often unhappiness is the best thing
                                       for them. Through unhappiness one can develop faculties. Our own concern for
                                       them was to give them beauty. For humans can endure hardships and grief and
                                       disasters but they cannot endure ugliness. Ugliness destroys their souls.
                                       But children have a right to happiness. They require it. And they require
                                       all sorts of opportunities and experiences which are dependent on the very
                                       wide interests and activities of their elders. So the feminine element began
                                       to work like yeast and everybody just naturally began to ferment.

            <p><a name="d0e6915"></a>Afterward we went away down the hill to a little rocky outcrop looking out
                                       over Sailors Bay there was one of his most lately-built houses, snugly set
                                       on the edge of a huge boulder, half hidden behind trees, and with wild
                                       flowers clambering up to its very doorsill it seemed the embodiment of all
                                       the fairy tales in the world. Its concrete walls, deepened to a lovely
                                       weather stained yellow, fitted naturally into their woodland surroundings.
                                       From behind its long glass doors one could imagine nursery rhyme children
                                       peeping, or elfin folk scampering in and out between the concrete lanterns
                                       on the flat roof, from which the house takes its name.

            <p><a name="d0e6918"></a>The occupant of the house was away pro tempore, but we wandered unchecked
                                       through the happy little sunfilled rooms, with their walls of soft gold and
                                       blue, past the little fireplace in the living room corner, also molded out
                                       of concrete, with built-in bookcases beside it, past two little quiet
                                       bedrooms, each with its built-in wardrobe, and a bath room with an
                                       egg-shell-blue tile floor, until we found a wee kitchen with built-in
                                       dresser and servery <a name="231"></a> [Note: i.e., a room from which meals are served],
                                       and a twin sink finished in German silver. Here the Queen of Hearts might
                                       have made her tarts on almost any day.

                                       began and they went on and it soon became evident that every man is
                                       naturally a genius and every one hungry to express his genius.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6941"></a>First the obvious thing - a Progress Association - which as it worked out was
                                       the most difficult of all because it meant the breaking down of class
                                       boundaries which really can't be done in a community which has a group of
                                       people legally authorized as superior which fills the souls of people with
                                       bitterness and malice. But we played a bit of hob with the idea anyway. The
                                       difficulty instantly arose from the fact that we included within the
                                       boundaries of the association the neighboring thickly populated workman's
                                       district (the term is theirs not ours) because the main North and South
                                       thoroughfare was there and seemed a natural line of demarcation. But no. The
                                       invisible line between the ordinary thing and the something different that
                                       was being done constituted an impassible barrier in the minds of the already
                                       settled district, one that could not be crossed except on the basis of
                                       warfare. Americans, though they use the word, have not the slightest idea of
                                       the meaning of the word "class." The nearest they come to it is a conception
                                       of snobbery which is a totally different thing.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6944"></a>Thus it was when, with our innocent American minds, we organized a children's
                                       Christmas party. These parties! Unforgettably beautiful things.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6947"></a>Within the boundaries of Castlecrag anyone could buy a lot. Anyone could
                                       build a house. But one couldn't be in Castlecrag long before one became a
                                       Castlecragger and with no external pressure, just the attraction of what was
                                       going on.

            <p><a name="d0e6950"></a>In the Progress Association Mrs. G. <a name="234"></a> [Note: Griffin] had charge of the
                                       Junior Branch which showed tendencies of swamping the club so a suggestion
                                       was made that there should be an age limit. Mrs. G. agreed and suggested
                                       that 75 should be the limit set. Her suggestion was carried by acclimation,
                                       perhaps more truthfully described as shouts of laughter.

            <p><a name="d0e6977"></a>The Ballet was inaugurated. Some of us did the simpler things in the ballet
                                       but Louisa <a name="235"></a> [Note: Lightfoot] went ahead with enthusiasm and industry
                                       even with the surprising feats the Russians do. At the end of the season we
                                       were showing Sydney things. The Ballet became a permanent thing at
                                       Castlecrag and a lovely feature in nearly all the social life and frolics,
                                       one of them a lovely thing around a bonfire in the lower valley under the
                                       full moon among the wondrous smooth red-barked and white-barked gum trees.
                                       Later on we took a moving picture of this Arabian dance, a capture of the
                                       ladies of the Harem, our leading lady being carried off along the winding
                                       path down the valley, high up in the air on the hand of the bandit chief. It
                                       was screened in the metropolitan theatres.

            <p><a name="d0e6983"></a>A youth had a longing for the drama. He had spoken his pieces at some of our
                                       parties. Mrs. G. <a name="236"></a> [Note: Griffin] told him he could use her house any
                                       time he wanted to, so the dramatic club was formed - The Dais. It soon
                                       appeared that one of the young women was a very fine ingenue and the
                                       family's enthusiasm led to their home being used for the meetings and
                                       sometimes for the performances. But always in emergencies 56 The Parapet was
                                       available. The young founder developed a fine capacity for decoration and
                                       stage setting and everybody joined The Dais. Stodgy old fat fellows proved
                                       geniuses in comedy. Their wives at times in tragedy. A woman who had had
                                       humiliating experiences bucked up and took a role and displayed such talent
                                       that it helped to remake her life and gave her status again. Club members
                                       began to write plays and these and other performances were at times given in
                                       the city. Castlecrag individuals and groups got the habit of taking prizes
                                       in metropolitan affairs. Professionals were invited out and came with a bit
                                       of haughty feeling but waked up with a new idea before the evenings were
                                       over.

            <p><a name="d0e7013"></a>The early dwellings in Castlecrag were not large but the architect's basic
                                       principle was that the one essential in a home was a good sized assembly
                                       room and then anything more you could afford. And the numbers that used to
                                       roll up for those parties! And sometimes a party spilled over into the house
                                       next door and stunts were doubled and laughing processions passed each other
                                       going from one house to the other. All Sydney would have come if we could
                                       have accommodated them. The finest musical talent of Sydney and many
                                       visiting artists came and sang and played for us. And many a one on leaving
                                       has said, "I'll be glad to come any time you want me Mrs. Griffin." Always
                                       the feeling that they were getting as much as they were giving. A hundred, a
                                       hundred and fifty was not unusual and the charming events and fun without
                                       any need of artificial stimulants kept them going till the wee small hours.
                                       And "How do you get such people together," was a frequent comment. Or,
                                       "Nowhere do we find such gatherings as these."

                                       Mr. Herbert's and started a Neighborhood Circle on cultural lines with
                                       lectures and discussions, and again everybody came not because they were
                                       asked but because it was too interesting to stay away from. Outsiders as
                                       well as Craggers were welcome to all the functions. And the pick of the
                                       lecturers were ready to come to talk to Castlecrag. Castlecrag was being
                                       looked upon as important and there were not more than ten dwellings there.

            <p><a name="d0e7062"></a>In the house with the inner court we found delightful things to photograph,
                                       for instance, the central open court around which the living and sleeping
                                       apartments are grouped. This was gay with stag ferns and begonia,
                                       sun-dappled, and musical with the sound of running water. In this gracious
                                       natural atmosphere, the Chinese fountain, the strange and restless molding
                                       decorations on the glass doors, seemed almost human. The living room opening
                                       from this court is a delightful place, with a great window framing a perfect
                                       view of Middle Harbor and the Heads beyond. The walls in this room are rough
                                       finished, in small square tiles, beautifully toned in blue and gold.

            <p><a name="d0e7090"></a>Trying things have happened of course but let them simmer in the varying
                                       lights and shades of this interplay of nature and humanity and as a rule
                                       they come through in a very satisfactory way. And always there is the
                                       feeling of things growing and building up. And more and more is enthusiasm
                                       rising, ever more and more opportunities offering to each and every
                                       individual. And all the time there is right at hand the infinite peace of
                                       stillness and utter seclusion when one wants it in the midst of perfect
                                       beauty. Always the intimate contact with nature that is absolutely essential
                                       to the education of children (who cannot be educated in our cities as they
                                       stand) and that is so healing to the sick soul.

            <p><a name="d0e7093"></a>Men and women must work together in practically all fields. But it is true
                                       that there are certain things women can do that men cannot. The essential
                                       man's function is to conquer nature. Woman stands timid and frightened
                                       before that requirement, whereas man registers joy and enthusiasm at the
                                       very thought of it and at every opportunity that offers. Woman's function is
                                       to see to it that man does not destroy what he has conquered. Today man is
                                       conquering and destroying the world and woman is failing to perform her
                                       function.

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7141"></a>There are some 400 species of Wattles in Australia. Their blossoms are mostly
                                       small balls of stamens often in great clusters shading from pale buff to
                                       pure gold. Usually spherical balls but sometimes small cylinders like trees
                                       of goldenrod.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7144"></a>Their leaves may be anything from phylloids to needles to pinnate but I think
                                       their cotyledon leaves are always pinnate. And the acacias run all sizes
                                       from small open shrubs to stately trees such as this Melanoxylon. On the
                                       whole they are not long lived as they are especially subject to insect
                                       pests. Their bark is used for tanning.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7147"></a>There are great treks to the bush, for that is what Australians call the
                                       forests, in wattle blooming time, different seasons in different districts
                                       for there are wattles for every one of the 12 months of the year. Some of
                                       their leaves are pure silver so you can do marvelous things with them in
                                       landscape work. This was the big brush with which Griffin loved to do his
                                       paintings.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7150"></a>The Wattles are the Golden Rod trees of Australia, over 400 varieties, whose
                                       flowers run the gamut of the yellows from pale cream to deep gold, and there
                                       is never a time when some of them are not in bloom. So with proper selection
                                       you can have superb masses of bloom every month of the year and forms from
                                       the daintiest of shrubs, the perfumed Suaveolens, to the stately
                                       Melanoxylon, the foliage of every conceivable shape but always evergreen.
                                       Would that some true philanthropist would plant our desert western slopes
                                       with Wattles.

                                       concrete, with walls of less than the prescribed thickness, if satisfied

            <p><a name="d0e7192"></a>The members of the Ordinance Conference recognized that it was impossible to
                                       foresee developments in the use of concrete and unwise to embody anything
                                       that might, by its restrictions, hinder the progress of building science,
                                       involving the use of this material. The Conference did the only thing
                                       possible, it placed upon the Councils the responsibility of investigating
                                       any design of concrete construction submitted and of allowing or disallowing
                                       its use upon its merits.

            <p><a name="d0e7195"></a>While reinforced concrete construction has proved to be both sound and
                                       economical for large buildings, efforts to adapt it to the special
                                       requirements of residential work have not been very encouraging. Some years
                                       ago, it will be remembered, Mr. <a name="242"></a> [Note: Thomas Alva] Edison was credited
                                       with the statement that he had almost perfected a scheme for casting cement
                                       houses in one piece with floors, roofs, pipe ducts and chimneys, as well as
                                       baths, sinks and other fixtures, all part of the house. The molds for these
                                       were to be set up in a few days, the pouring was to be done in a few hours
                                       and after another week or thereabouts, the molds were to be removed and the
                                       "home" was to be ready for occupation. Fortunately this was one of the
                                       abortive efforts of the wonder-man inventor, for the possibility of having
                                       whole streets - of having whole suburbs filled with these cast monstrosities
                                       is shocking to contemplate.

                                       writer that is interesting. It possesses in a large measure the advantages
                                       of flexibility possessed by brick, the unit being 6 inches, the width and
                                       length of a half tile, vertically and horizontally, and although the cost of
                                       the wall per superficial foot may be equal to that of a brick wall, there
                                       are other economies effected that favorably affect the total cost of the

            <p><a name="d0e7254"></a>There is first a saving of space, the walls being only 2 1/2 thick, including
                                       finish, as compared with brick external walls, plastered 12 in. thick, and
                                       brick internal walls, plastered, 6 in. thick. This means that an area which
                                       is only sufficient to build a cottage in brick work of five rooms would be
                                       large enough to build a cottage in concrete tiles with six rooms.

            <p><a name="d0e7257"></a>The thin walls are possible because the system of construction is columnar,
                                       the walls being curtain or enveloping walls only, with all loads carried by

                                       have their interlocking surfaces dipped in bitumen so that there are two
                                       waterproof membranes in the center of the finished walls. It will be seen
                                       that contact is made only at the positions marked (a) so that the wall is

                                       tile has two strands of reinforcing wire running horizontally. The tubular
                                       cells provide channels through which electric conduit, small service pipes,
                                       etc. can be taken.

                                       position of openings, but the curtain or enveloping walls will easily span a
                                       distance of 16 feet between columns. The columns are hollow and the larger
                                       service pipes for conveying roof water and sewage to the drains can be taken
                                       inside so that they do not appear on the outside wall faces.

                                       of a textured tile wall. The outer face has a surface like rubbed sandstone,
                                       the color varying with the sand used. This color may be uniform or the tones
                                       may be mixed to give vitality and texture; the joints are defined so that
                                       the face is divided into 12 inch squares, a very pleasing scale and these
                                       can again be divided into four by the lighter marking on the tile when it is
                                       used for the inside faces.

                                       houses on a scheme having tesseral <a name="246"></a> [Note: i.e., composed of a small square or
                                           tablet (tessera)] elements of the same facial size and similar
                                       appearance, though quite different in structural significance, since they
                                       form cavity walls in the ordinary sense, stable because of their mass rather
                                       than through specialized columnar or concentrated supports, and there are no
                                       vertebral segments. Internally segmental houses possess the advantage over
                                       all other finished types of house requiring no veneer of tiles, plaster,
                                       textile, paper, enamel or paint. The tesseral faces of hard dry concrete in
                                       any desired degree of smoothness or roughness are susceptible of stain or
                                       tint or any color, but without it they are of an acceptable finish in
                                       themselves, at the same time conveying the sense of strength and endurance
                                       which only the sincerity of solid homogeneous structure provides.

                                       setting, it is a unit among its neighbors, it is an interior fitted to meet

                                       Bonita is an absolutely minimum cost house. On this rocky and jumpy
                                       allotment which drops steeply down into the valley there was room for only
                                       the garage on the street level. Well sometimes it was a garage, sometimes an
                                       artist's studio, sometimes a drafting room with a huge drafting board in it
                                       under the two windows facing east, fine for laying out perspectives. It is
                                       as attractive as any part of the house because with knitlock there is no
                                       such thing as a lack of finish. The inside is the same as the outside. Color
                                       can be added but it is beautiful without, the tesserae vary somewhat in
                                       color as they come from the factory so at a little distance one gets the
                                       impression it is marble. Side windows were included in the garage for here
                                       again they don't run up the cost. With the front garage doors wide open it
                                       was a picture to see Mrs. Junge sitting there weaving richly colored rugs
                                       and draperies for her doll house which from across the valley looks like a
                                       castle.

            <p><a name="d0e7359"></a>The house drops lower, the top only 4 feet above the street level. A bridge
                                       across a bit of a chasm takes you under a trellis bower to the roof. What a
                                       view! Raking up and down the valley! The parapet wall needs no coping but a
                                       gracious note was added by perforating the top structural tiles as they were
                                       made which gives a graceful and quite Indian touch. Then down the steps

            <p><a name="d0e7807"></a>Primeval forms still hold in Australia, though time has hardened them. Not
                                       only the elemental things but in the whole animal and vegetable life. All
                                       primeval conditions have been retained somewhere so that men can get
                                       knowledge of evolution. Unless we call to mind that the earth was liquid
                                       before it was solid it is impossible to understand the vegetable life in
                                       Australia, even the trees.

            <p><a name="d0e7810"></a>In America I was taught that I must observe the laws of the growth of these
                                       and realize that the trunk grew smaller as it sent off its branches,
                                       tapering to the top. But many Australian trees pay no attention to these
                                       human theories. One of the Sterculias of Queensland is such a one. It looks
                                       just like a sea cucumber. Its trunk swells out and then narrows up at the
                                       top just like a cucumber and all its foliage spreads out like a circle of
                                       tentacles.

            <p><a name="d0e7839"></a>The necessity of preserving the life of the earth becomes a prime duty in
                                       every field of life. The following is a sketch of the application of this
                                       principle in one realm.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7842"></a>While I played around with the architect with whom I was working in the
                                       picturemaking business in which we both took such pleasure, Burley Griffin
                                       took things more seriously for there was the same difference between Louis
                                       Sullivan and many who followed him that there was between Griffin and
                                       myself. It is one thing to be a painter of lovely pictures. Sullivan thought
                                       in terms of construction as did Griffin, inventing and solving problems. New
                                       styles arise through the solving of the problems for new civilizations.
                                       Griffin turned out new methods of construction &amp; new forms of
                                       materials &amp; hardware, and so on. Many a time did someone seeing his
                                       indifference to patents ask permission to patent a thing, something he had
                                       worked out. To prevent this he did at times patent a thing to protect his
                                       clients. His only interest was that of the clients.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7845"></a>The baked tile form and construction was remodeled to meet his demands, for
                                       stability and weathering. They did it but made an awful fuss over the
                                       trouble it was, vowing they would never do it again, but shortly they were
                                       doing nothing else. He invented an interlocking concrete tile construction,
                                       most lovely, and the last word in economy in concrete residential work. The
                                       superficial appearance of this seen in pictures has been copied in some

                                       meant, at least in Griffin's hands, that every characteristic of a location
                                       was carefully considered and taken advantage of and no natural loveliness
                                       destroyed. Not only was there careful consideration of the location on the
                                       lot but even total transformation of customary plans to save this, or to get
                                       maximum effect from that. The invention of this

            <p><a name="d0e7875"></a>Griffin's double profession gave him an advantage in tackling the problem of
                                       developing the suburb of Sydney - Castlecrag - enabling him to show that the
                                       unique loveliness of Australia did not need to be wiped off the earth in the
                                       process of occupation but that 750 acres of natural garden with its
                                       wonderful variety of flowering evergreen trees and shrubs could be occupied
                                       as intensely as other suburbs, now hopeless deserts, and still remain 750
                                       acres of garden. And so it could be with the development of the whole
                                       continent. Man's interests are not necessarily in conflict with nature. He
                                       doesn't need to be a destroyer in order to live.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7878"></a>The system he established, contrary to custom, was to make the buildings as
                                       inconspicuous as possible, to construct them of local stone, an ideal
                                       building stone underlying the whole of Sydney. What a pity Sydney itself was
                                       so held by the throat by the brick trust backed by the bankers, doubtless
                                       shareholders. If only the municipalities of Sydney had been built of this
                                       stone which is so desirable that when Melbourne built important buildings it
                                       brought the stone all the way down the 400 miles from Sydney.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7881"></a>The banks would not lend money except on brick and Marseilles tile roof
                                       houses both materials entirely unsuited to the climate. Griffin fought them
                                       to the end. One lawsuit cost each of the parties $10,000. We have many
                                       reasons for believing it was instigated and even financed by the brick
                                       trust. It became too unsavory for the judge to be willing to give a judgment
                                       against Griffin so he demanded a compromise. Of course one understands that
                                       a councilman takes his life in his hands if he passes a building that
                                       differs in any particular from the routine

                                       methods of construction became convincing, since they solved all the
                                       problems of hot climates, minimum cost, permanent and fireproof
                                       construction, an asphalt pavement under the whole house with sleepers set in
                                       it and the finished floor of wood laid on it with no air space so solid
                                       floors (a thing which our imitator in the U.S. didn't do in the California
                                       house &amp; which <a name="252"></a> [Note: N-YHS reads "whose floors"] consequently
                                       had to be ripped up later); and cellular concrete roofs - termite and vermin
                                       proof and moisture proof keeping the house cool in summer and warm in
                                       winter. The Marseilles tile roofs are not satisfactory in this country of
                                       driving storms. Practically all of them leak. After one typical storm a
                                       telephone inspector told us that everywhere else in Sydney every house he
                                       had been in was leaking, some of them quite flooded, furniture damaged and
                                       so on. So he <a name="253"></a> [Note: Griffin] invented a concrete diagonal roof tile
                                       which successfully kept out the storms. These horizontal Sydney storms also
                                       frequently blew the rain right through even hollow brick walls.

            <p><a name="d0e7914"></a>So the brick trust is responsible for the denuding of Sydney's luxuriantly
                                       foliated gullies. With brick walls and the usual tile roofs the subtropical
                                       vegetation is a menace to the type of construction used throughout Sydney.
                                       The fig and bignonia <a name="254"></a> [Note: begonia?] vines and other wall climbers
                                       work into the joints and play hob with them. Great branches of trees fall
                                       and smash such construction. I myself know a little girl killed by a storm

                                       trees even but two or three feet from the wall could be left undisturbed
                                       making unnecessary the requirements of the banks that all shrubbery shall be

                                       buildings. I remember the cry from the heart of the owner of a building in
                                       Brisbane whose pink Bougainvillea was one of Australia's "sights" of which I
                                       had heard from many travelers, when she saw Castlecrag houses. "Oh, if my
                                       house had been built like that I shouldn't have had to cut down my
                                       Bougainvillea!"
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7939"></a>In Australia people complain of the heat and suffer with the cold. When they
                                       came into my house which stretched across the lot and opened up with a
                                       colonnade of windows to the lawn and the valley view, they would step out
                                       onto the lawn and feel the cold again, come back and look to see where the
                                       heat came from. It came from the floor, so this ideal under floor heating
                                       system of Mother Nature's keeps the house warm as in summer it keeps it
                                       cool. Then with the cellular reinforced concrete construction for the roof
                                       the house was kept warm in the winter and cool in the summer - as with an
                                       icebox. Here again however since everything is under control of officialdom
                                       every obstacle was put in the way. There was a state law requiring floors to
                                       be 18 inches above the ground. With the first C.C. <a name="255"></a> [Note: Castlecrag]
                                       house Griffin argued in vain with the council for a solid floor. The law was
                                       intended to prevent dry rot, but with no air, floor in bitumen, there is no
                                       dry rot which is really rot from moisture.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7945"></a>So with the second house Griffin decided to defy the council. He built it
                                       with a solid floor but fortunately (for councils are ruthless) before the
                                       house was completed the angels came to his rescue and sent the bubonic
                                       plague to Sydney. At Griffin's instigation (for he missed no chances)
                                       several doctors wrote to the papers saying it was a strange thing that in a
                                       place subject to bubonic plague it should be against the law to build a
                                       rat-proof house. Pressure was brought to bear and the law was repealed. So
                                       no longer could the law impede this step. But except for Castlecrag don't
                                       think for a moment that a general change

                                       and nobody is inclined to attempt any changes. Griffin's houses continued to
                                       be the only houses in Australia that were comfortable winter and summer.
                                       Elsewhere dank, smelly, verminous spaces under one's house, scorched shins
                                       and shivering backs and chilblains in the winter - the dance hall or movie
                                       or bed the only warm places.

            <p><a name="d0e7969"></a>The tile roof with its ventilated air space served somewhat in keeping the
                                       house cool in summer but in winter, since heat rises, it promptly let all
                                       the heat out whereas with cellular reinforced concrete construction it
                                       functioned like an ice-box keeping the warmth out in summer and in in the
                                       winter. But the fight against the flat roofs was perpetual though almost all
                                       the big modern buildings in every city in the world are flat roofed. Such
                                       are the absurdities of bureaucratic rule.

            <p><a name="d0e7972"></a>This going to the root of things enabled Griffin to solve the architectural
                                       problem of the design of flat roof houses which I had seen struggled over in
                                       the offices where I had worked but never solved. Of course there is always
                                       the packing box type but that is no solution. "It doesn't take an architect
                                       to design a packing box." (The Chicago Sun) That is no solution. Beauty and
                                       character are essential elements of architecture as versus engineering -
                                       flesh as well as bone. It was well solved in the dwelling of Mr. Melson in
                                       the lovely bit of river valley in which as landscape architect he
                                           <a name="256"></a> [Note: Griffin] enabled his clients to preserve the beauty,
                                       although occupied, in his Mason City group scheme. When asked what style of
                                       architecture the Castlecrag houses were his answer was - "Early 20th Century
                                       Australian Architecture."

            <p><a name="d0e8009"></a>Without doubt all plants have their particular significance to men and the
                                       real objectiveness of their qualities has been borne out in the quite
                                       independent appeal of certain types of plants to certain classes of people.
                                       Children and amateur gardeners for instance are first drawn to flowering
                                       annuals perhaps because with these the will can be exercised to get
                                       immediate results. Age and experience bring wider interests but so important
                                       to the Briton is the functioning of his will that his appreciation of nature
                                       finds its greatest scope in gardens, even to "Garden" cities.

            <p><a name="d0e8012"></a>The limitation of this objective is that the gardener's standard of judgment
                                       is the perfect specimen plant instead of the comprehensive group entity. The
                                       architect's ideal is often somewhat similarly confined but he is less
                                       concerned with the facility of cultivation than the forms appropriate to
                                       architectural settings, whereas the landscape architect sees in all plants
                                       the possible adaptation of their texture, color and silhouette for the
                                       enhancing of effect of perspective and scale necessary to induce sublimity,
                                       serenity, freedom or other feelings, appropriate to any given situation.

                                       perfectness was to be found in the prickly paper-bark ti-tree. The final
                                       word in stateliness however was left for a specimen of multi-columnar
                                       cypress pine near the north lagoon of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens then
                                       labeled Callitris columellaris. All these trees demanded preference in
                                       planting plans but no nurseryman nor gardener could ever produce this last
                                       named plant. The botanical reference classified it only as a variety of a
                                       North Coast species whose illustration indicated a totally different
                                       character of tree. Subsequently the specimen in Melbourne was renamed
                                       correspondingly though evidently it has never borne cones to verify its
                                       identification. In the grounds of a sanitarium called "Penquite, Doncaster
                                       Road," North Baldwin, Melbourne, is to be found a hedge of this species,
                                       thirty to forty feet high from which seeds can be procured as they are
                                       freely bearing. Dr. Scougall has done vital service to the topmost branch of
                                       art - Ground Planning, Ensemble Planning - in bringing to notice the 50 or
                                       60 grand examples of this superlative tree which have been 60 to 80 years
                                       maturing in the old Grace Yard garden of Gladesville. These now known
                                       cultivated specimens already explain many things and will furnish the
                                       necessary clues to cultivation and, since one of then is seed bearing, will
                                       certainly re-establish the species in horticulture. Its sure adoption in

                                       tree fern trunk innumerable seed have sprouted and a sassafras has sent
                                       streamers down to the ground some 6 feet below and established an enduring
                                       trunk. The interlacing of colors is impossible to portray. Back a bit we see
                                       a giant <a name="261"></a> [Note: N-YHS adds "white barked"] gum shooting up into the sky,
                                       smooth as a telegraph pole. A bit of sky-blue above and its reflection in a

            <p><a name="d0e8133"></a>The Fern Tree gullies! Nothing like them in all the world. Moist the year
                                       around. Luxuriant with an infinite variety of growth from the Fagus
                                       Cunninghamii, the Australian beech, with leaves shaped and arranged like our
                                       Maiden Hair Fern, to the fern covering of dripping rocks. The leaves of the
                                       Sassafras itself are a bit fern-like. And the moisture of the gullies turns
                                       the bark of all these smooth barked trees all the delicate moss and lichen
                                       colors. So many of the Australian trees, unlike ours, have showy masses of
                                       blossoms that pilgrimages to the fern gullies in the Spring time are not
                                       unlike the Japanese pilgrimages to the flowering cherry and plum.

            <p><a name="d0e8152"></a>Being of a sanguine temperament, an airy temperament, though I never spent
                                       more than the five minutes between recitations in studying any lesson yet I
                                       always stood high in my classes in High School. Such is the advantage of the
                                       sanguines always have over the other temperaments. Showy they are and Jacks

                                       for that husband of mine. If I did owe him a debt from a previous
                                       incarnation, I surely did my best to pay it in full. It is as well I had no
                                       idea of that as the driving force, for the joy of those wonderful years with
                                       one of the most important men of his generation would surely have flown if
                                       there had been any admixture of obligation in the services rendered. Only in
                                       late life could the two angles be reconciled and the circle complete. How
                                       wisely do we, in planning for a new life, blot out the remembrance of those
                                       past debts until such time as bonds shall be so strong that nothing can
                                       matter.

                                       wife nor bureaucracy. Yet no one ever saw him angry. When the war was on he
                                       drove ahead regardless of specious pleas of altered circumstance. Nor did he
                                       concern himself with the war until the destruction of the cathedrals began
                                       when from his indifference to the loss of life (which I must confess shocked
                                       me a bit for his nature was sweetness itself in his human relations) he
                                       became incensed at such outrages and insisted the Germans should be wiped
                                       off the face of the earth. When I objected to his inconsistency (for through
                                       that war, from our Australian vantage point, we were more pro-German than
                                       pro-ally) he brushed aside my arguments saying men could easily be replaced
                                       but how could one ever make up for the lost cathedrals.

                                       had read years before in Bailey. He had full use of that absolute memory

                                       accurately from near by or far away. Only the aboriginals could beat him at

                                       fertility of the soil. There were some 35 centers for distributing the

                                       really destroying the fertility of the soil - killing the earth.

            <p><a name="d0e8230"></a>Australia is rapidly being awakened to the fact that there is something
                                       radically wrong with the present methods. Scarcely a week passes without a
                                       column or half-column article about the serious condition of the soil, about
                                       blights of the products and the diseases of the animals fed from the large
                                       quantity production methods attained by chemical fertilizers and other
                                       materialistic scientific methods some of which are denuding the districts,
                                       some creating growing deserts whose dry sands are sweeping on, constantly
                                       increasing the desert area, some of which are reducing the fertility of the
                                       soil till it is becoming a pasty concrete-like substance, its fertility
                                       lost. It is a pity

            <p><a name="d0e8282"></a>In Australia almost all the residential gardening consists of completely
                                       destroying all the natural growth and then putting in European plants, the
                                       consequence of which is that no matter how beautiful a garden might be when
                                       made when, as always happens sooner or later, the home passes into other
                                       hands it entirely disappears, for such plantings require constant attention
                                       without which they cannot last through the long dry seasons, so that on the
                                       whole the towns and suburbs are barren deserts compared with what we are
                                       accustomed to in America.

            <p><a name="d0e8285"></a>Griffin's method of planting together according to color gave his plantings a
                                       splendor one rarely sees, and for seasonal ensembles too. To attain these
                                       ends he supplemented the flora somewhat, especially with South African
                                       plants whose local conditions closely resemble those of Australia and in
                                       which individual flowers are larger usually. So interested was he in losing
                                       no foot of planting space that on the whole he urged the building of flat
                                       roofs of reinforced concrete which, as occupation became more complete,
                                       could be covered with 8 inches of soil and planted with the choicest and
                                       gayest of flowering things. Thus occupation need not diminish the acreage of
                                       garden existing before man's invasion. Especially desirable is this on
                                       sloping or terraced ground where one looks down on the buildings which thus
                                       become garden features in the midst of greenery, the roads below hidden by
                                       the tree foliage.

                                       strangeness of the manner of growth of the mysterious flora. I myself in my
                                       study of drawing had been taught that trees grew just so; that the trunks
                                       grew smaller and branched out and towered upward. But no rules could be laid
                                       down for the forms of trees in Australia.

                                       in the drawings of Mr. Eric Saunders, which show the ever recurring

                                       They are more animal or human. Your mind cannot cope with the problem they
                                       present till you search back and back beyond the research of physical
                                       science into spiritual science which reveals that before Australia, was

                                       know things that cannot be learned through physical senses but which
                                       nevertheless the earth reveals to us and proves.

                                       half or crescent moon, a type of leaf which we find nowhere else. Then one
                                       can understand these strange animal forms.

            <p><a name="d0e8362"></a>The great bottle tree of Queensland, the Sterculia, is another instance. Its
                                       huge branchless bottle-shaped trunk, topped with an umbrella of leafy
                                       branches looks just like a gigantic sea cucumber. Such understanding, as
                                       always, established more friendly relations and we wished it could be
                                       attained by more of the European invaders so many of whom had a real
                                       antipathy to this vegetation so strange to them. From the first we had been
                                       very enthusiastic, feeling that the archangel who had painted this continent
                                       was the greatest artist of them all. I myself had done much architectural
                                       exhibition rendering work and had come near to creating some of these types
                                       to meet the requirements of architects who would insist that their buildings
                                       should be very such in evidence in my renderings of them. So I had strained
                                       a point in the veracity of the trees I used, but here nature itself
                                       accomplished the decorative character required, for many of the trees were
                                       so open in their foliage that the structural members - trunks and joints and
                                       branches were always well in view, and their trunks with their endless range
                                       of color and texture and markings were exquisitely decorative too. It needed
                                       no stretch of imagination to make mural decorations of these trees. In my
                                       ever busy life there was always a minor strain because I was not able to
                                       make a set of at least a hundred of these wonderful decorations so lavishly
                                       put forth by the fairies of this ancient continent, the Gnomes dissolving
                                       the rocks for tender rootlets, the Undines carrying up the sap, the Sylphs
                                       forming the flowers, and the Fire Fairies the seeds.

                                       around. Luxuriant with an infinite variety of growth from the Fagus
                                       Cunninghamii, the Australian beech with leaves shaped and arranged like our
                                       maiden hair fern, to the fern covering of dripping rocks. The leaves of the
                                       Sassafras tree itself growing there are a bit fernlike. And the moisture of
                                       the gullies turns the bark of all those smooth barked trees to all the
                                       delicate moss and lichen colors. So many of the Australian trees, unlike
                                       ours, have showy masses of blossoms that pilgrimages to the fern tree
                                       gullies in the spring-time are not unlike the Japanese pilgrimages to the
                                       flowering cherry and plum. A pity these Anglo-Saxons have not the reverence

                                       a particular district. One can see therefore how disastrous it is when by
                                       fire or otherwise the trees of a region are destroyed. In all probability
                                       these same can be found nowhere else. With the various members of our
                                       families visiting us at not wide intervals, we took a number of trips and
                                       often noted how, even in the course of one day, we would go through several
                                       remarkable distinctive types of forest. The change might be quite sudden
                                       with some slight unnoticeable difference in circumstance. The Eucalypt was
                                       the prevalent tree but its completely different types ran into the hundreds;
                                       the lovely spotted Gum silver gray with quite formal rounded spots of a
                                       deeper shade; or Rubida, pure white with towering trunk; some of them
                                       running to the height of our California tallest trees though not so great in
                                       girth; or in the cooler regions at a higher level, the twisting white trunks
                                       of the Snow Gum; or down the valley, dark, rough, patterned bark of the
                                       Mess-Mates named for their habit of growing in pairs. One did not need to

                                       carry on their scientific investigations by direct perception in the realms
                                       of the four formative forces, the life forces. It is a relationship somewhat
                                       of the nature of that of the citrus fruit trees to the nasturtiums which if
                                       planted around them prevent the ordinary blights to which the citrus fruits
                                       are subject in our artificial way of growing them. One could copy literally
                                       the forms and colors as they were handled in nature itself arranged just as
                                       one is taught to do with pigments to get luminous effects by juxtaposition
                                       of color against color instead of the amateurish way of trying to present
                                       color directly and imitatively. In Australia you could imitate and still get

            <p><a name="d0e8457"></a>The Leptospermum, the Ti-tree of New South Wales, is weird beyond words. It
                                       carries to the extreme all the characteristics of Australian forestry. It
                                       seems a very part of the rock formations and yet it emphasizes in even the
                                       trunk that spiral which is the great mathematical deity at the base of all
                                       plant life. The hyperboloid, the leaf form. That archetype which
                                           <a name="276"></a> [Note: Johann Wolfgang von] Goethe saw, the ego back of all plant
                                       life, the idea which Goethe explained to <a name="277"></a> [Note: Friedrich von] Schiller
                                       who after a while said - "Oh you mean your idea." "Well," said Goethe, "If
                                       it was my idea I saw my idea." This hyperboloid is one of the creations of
                                       the Great Primeval Creative Spirits, the hyperboloid which in the plant
                                       kingdom spirals its way from the finite to the infinite. The tree by its
                                       nature is immortal, forever young as its living part lies between the
                                       external bark and the interior core, as young after centuries have passed as
                                       in its early days. We see this movement in the twining vane, in the spiral,
                                       sometimes compacted into a circle, of the arrangements of leaves on the
                                       stem, and if you want your dreams to climb out of their grotesqueries into
                                       the infinite send your soul as you go to sleep up this mounting curve. In
                                       the plant kingdom it can't go so high but expands and contracts in three
                                       great cycles - leaf to stem, blossom to pistil, fruit to seed.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8466"></a>The leptospermum grows in dense masses, an almost impenetrable low forest,
                                       grey in stem and branch and leaf, though an occasional single tree gets left
                                       behind as the grove moves across the sandy seacoast over which it spreads
                                       its roots wide in search for water. For though the plants create the
                                       minerals we find as crystals and rocks, the plants themselves arise from the
                                       kingdom of liquidity.

            <p><a name="d0e8482"></a>For many years there had been the opposition of the councils since any
                                       specifications for residences deviating from those laid down by the Roman
                                       Empire were not to be tolerated. And there was the united front of Australia
                                       against anyone coming from the outside for the open door to immigration has
                                       never been the policy of Australia, that open door policy that made the
                                       United States the richest country in the world. So that in addition to the
                                       refusals of the banks to lend money except to the routine spec builders and
                                       their clients, and their requirement that the building should be brick since
                                       they had holdings in the brick trust which prevented the whole community
                                       from building with the beautiful local stone, the opposition was supported
                                       by the whole legal profession. Naturally individuals negotiating for the
                                       purchase of a lot would refer the matter to a lawyer for technical advice,
                                       contract form, and so on. I think without exception the lawyers of Sydney
                                       did not limit their advice to such points but unanimously discouraged their
                                       clients from purchasing land at Castlecrag. Of course the point they made
                                       openly was the covenants but the real reason was that Griffin was a
                                       foreigner. But we kept on keeping on. Covenants were not new to the British
                                       Empire.

            <p><a name="d0e8485"></a>After several years Griffin noticed a suspicious advertisement in the paper.
                                       In undertaking this enterprise he had done all the so called promotion work.
                                       He had discovered the property and bought it himself, making the first
                                       deposits, and forming the company had sold the shares. He took no promoter's
                                       fees for any of this work but made it clear from the beginning that what he
                                       needed and would take as a substitute would be a managing director's
                                       control, for a unified management would be essential for the carrying out of
                                       the planned and covenanted development. It was written into the original
                                       articles that the first three shares which he owned should have a special
                                       voting power which would give him this control.

            <p><a name="d0e8488"></a>In the early years he never used this power but the share-holders always knew
                                       it was there and finally decided they would "put one over"

            <p><a name="d0e8507"></a>on him. An advertisement appeared in the Sydney papers. This suspicious
                                       paragraph was an advertisement for a manager of an estate, the wording of
                                       which sounded much like Castlecrag. Griffin immediately looked into the
                                       matter in order to prevent a possible fait accompli. The situation resolved
                                       itself into a lawsuit between Griffin and the company to establish the
                                       status of the special voting power of his shares. This dragged on for months
                                       piling up costs into the thousands of pounds for both parties for the
                                       British law is the Roman law based on the protection of the citizens against
                                       the foreigner and the judge was evidently very loath to give a verdict for
                                       Griffin though he accused the shareholders of flagrant dishonesty in the
                                       evidence they gave. You see there were too many covenanted properties in the
                                       community for him to want to outlaw covenants. He finally hit on an
                                       ingenious way of distinguishing between the three shares and gave his
                                       verdict that two of them carried the special voting power but not the third.
                                       No one hearing the case could tell whether Griffin had lost or won. As it
                                       happened he had enough other shares to maintain his majority vote. How
                                       disgusted the judge must have been.

            <p><a name="d0e8510"></a>Now a curious thing happened. For some time I had been dilating to the young
                                       folks who passed through my hands on a pet theory. I think something of
                                       Louis Sullivan's I had read put the notion in my head. It was that emotions
                                       are real forces. If a thing can bring about deeds it must be a force, so why
                                       waste such forces? If one was tempted to fly into a rage why should one just
                                       suppress that force? Why not instead divert it to some special use as with
                                       electricity one can turn on a current to illuminate a room or to heat a flat
                                       iron. So my advice to the young fry was to divert such forces from direct
                                       explosions into acquiring a house and lot, or a horse and buggy. We had much
                                       fun over it but when this serious situation arose I definitely undertook to
                                       divert my many opportunities for wrathful explosions, or for soul
                                       development, to the end of bringing it about that, if it was really of

            <p><a name="d0e8548"></a>Some of the share-holders had been going around quite openly bragging that
                                       they didn't care whether they won this first suit or not; that it was the
                                       company's money against Griffin's private resources and they would take the
                                       case from court to court until they bankrupted him. However, when the
                                       verdict was given against the company, nothing happened. It had been a long
                                       drawn out affair. But one day when Griffin was down in Melbourne, our lawyer
                                       rang me and said something had happened and would I come down to take lunch
                                       with him to talk the matter over. He started the conversation by saying,
                                       "Now don't get excited." He was, by the way, one of those to whom I had
                                       aired my theories. And then he told me that the lawyers on the opposite side
                                       had come to him asking as a favor of courtesy of the profession that he
                                       should grant them the privilege of appealing the case. He had consulted with
                                       his partner on the matter and the partner, a considerably older man, had
                                       said that in this particular case where the personal venom of the opposing
                                       party was well known, he should not acquiesce in such a request without the
                                       permission of his client.

            <p><a name="d0e8551"></a>What had happened was this. On our side we had one solicitor and one
                                       barrister, a requisite in the British courts. The Company opposing us had
                                       two solicitors and four barristers, the most renowned company barristers in
                                       Australia, all experienced and knowing the technicalities in these questions
                                       thoroughly. But the Powers that be had apparently put them all to sleep just
                                       long enough for, if a case is to be appealed to the higher courts, the
                                       intention must be put before the court before a fortnight has passed, and a
                                       deposit of 100 pounds laid down as evidence of sincerity. The fortnight had
                                       passed. It was required that if a case were to be taken to the Privy Council
                                       this intention must be put before the court within three weeks. The three
                                       weeks had just expired when suddenly they woke up to the fact that no longer
                                       was it in

            <p><a name="d0e8576"></a>As time went on, a doctor came to this community with the intention of making
                                       his home there and of building a private and convalescent hospital as well.
                                       With all its rural loveliness, we were so near the center of the city that
                                       the doctor could get to his urban office in twelve minutes by using a
                                       doctor's privilege of speeding when he chose. From its initiation, with the
                                       purchase of a building already constructed as a nucleus, this enterprise was
                                       very successful. Consequently he bought further property adjacent for an
                                       extension of the hospital and, across the street, for a separate dwelling.
                                       From the beginning he was delighted with the type of development and with
                                       the charm and advantage of the flat roof. He called upon Griffin as
                                       architect in these further structures but instead of calling for tenders as
                                       was Griffin's custom, he preferred to use a builder who had previously done
                                       work for him. We are now convinced that the brick trust took advantage of
                                       this to influence Dr. Rivett to defy the covenant which required that no
                                       construction could be carried our without the consent of the Company's
                                       architect. One point after another was brought up to alter the structure

            <p><a name="d0e8611"></a>in entire sympathy. Griffin acquiesced in one after another of these but also
                                       the builder was constantly on the alert to slip something over without
                                       Griffin's knowledge, and presently we saw that construction was being pushed
                                       ahead for a sloping tile roof instead of the flat one as on the working
                                       drawings. It was not that Griffin would not authorize tile roofs or had not
                                       at times done so where the client desired and no disadvantage would result
                                       from obstructing the view of the neighboring dwellings and this house was on
                                       the top level but, if such construction was effected without his approval,
                                       it would make it impossible to enforce the covenant, since it would be a
                                       defiance of the covenant, and would establish a precedent. He made every
                                       possible speed to place an injunction to prevent proceeding with this roof,
                                       but the builder drove ahead working day and night and Sundays to complete it
                                       even after the injunction had been placed. Again we were in the courts.

            <p><a name="d0e8614"></a>The costs for each party ran up to $10,000. The judge was finding it
                                       difficult to get a foot to stand on for giving the verdict against the
                                       foreigner but finally, in preparing to sum up the case, he hit upon a bright
                                       idea and brought up a trifling point to which even the opposing barrister
                                       rose to say he didn't put any weight on that particular piece of evidence.
                                       The judge, however, waived him aside and gave the decision on that point
                                       alone against Griffin. Consideration for others makes it impossible for me
                                       to state what the point was, but it sufficed to give the verdict against
                                       Griffin without implicating the covenants. To have established a precedent
                                       for defying covenants would have menaced important imperial interests and
                                       would have discredited him in the profession so we did not reap the
                                       technical advantage of having the covenant issue established but the suit
                                       was so conspicuous that it really did establish it in the eyes of the
                                       community.

                                       Griffin's signed approval on the drawing. As it happened, when this drawing
                                       had been submitted to Griffin with a particular form of construction, he had
                                       signed his name in approval but before returning it and sent it over to be
                                       blue printed so that when he produced the blue print it became apparent that
                                       the document had been altered after his signature. Curiously enough no one
                                       in the court stressed this fact but when the architect looked confounded and
                                       distressed about it everyone used every means of quieting his nerves and
                                       placating him, even our own lawyer (an Australian of course), so no weight
                                       was given to this fact. However by this time the judge was getting a bit
                                       jittery and gave very strong instructions to the lawyers to get their
                                       clients together in a mutual agreement that would remove the case from the
                                       court. An agreement was arrived at and that was that.

            <p><a name="d0e8641"></a>Griffin had entered these cases only because the whole of his undertaking
                                       would have been brought to an end if he had not taken action. We already
                                       knew the ways in which foreigners would be handled in the courts. We learned
                                       that from an experience of my own in the early years of our stay in
                                       Australia. I had for some years before been practicing architecture either
                                       on my own or in partnership and took it as a matter of course that if
                                       anything worked that way I should continue in my profession. A residential
                                       job was brought to me and I carried it through. When the construction was
                                       completed the client refused to pay any fee. I myself was inclined to do
                                       nothing about it but Griffin thought that was improper, that in a way an
                                       architect owed it to his profession not to accept such a situation. So it
                                       was taken to the court.

            <p><a name="d0e8644"></a>Now one does not need to say that judges as a whole are corrupt. In an
                                       ingenious system such as the British Empire they need only a few, or perhaps
                                       only one, to manage the situations that may require a corrupt judge. The
                                       method is the following one and was used in my case. When the listing of the
                                       cases was published my own was far down on the list, 20 cases

            <p><a name="d0e8665"></a>ahead of mine, so far away that my barrister put off looking into my
                                       testimony on the day when we went to court. Not the regular judge but a
                                       different one was on the bench. Evidently the barristers as a whole when
                                       they saw the judge who was sitting knew something was up and one after
                                       another of them made some sort of a plea for the delaying of their cases
                                       till mine was left the first on the list. Just why my own lawyer made no
                                       such attempt, I don't know. This judge had shortly before been used for a
                                       similar purpose in a Parliamentary case. My client had been brought to me by
                                       a civil servant, i.e., by an enemy, of our acquaintance. When the newspaper
                                       reporters came in the following session before court was called I heard one
                                       of them say, "Well what mischief's up now." The response was simply a
                                       lifting of the eyebrows. Curious eyes were turned on me. The evidence was
                                       taken on both sides and stress laid on such points as my having used undue
                                       pressure on my client to induce him to accept my advice, one of the
                                       evidences being that I had given him pains-taking and very complete and
                                       attractive looking drawings. Also that the absurdity of having a heating
                                       system had been forced on him. The discomfort of the winter season was in
                                       fact one of the things he was anxious that I should solve, counting on my
                                       American experience to accomplish that. The client himself was a civil
                                       servant and I am sure they must have had him in the bag in some way for
                                       quite evidently he had been told not to worry, to say anything he wanted to,
                                       that nothing he said would prevent his winning the case for, much to the
                                       astonishment of my lawyers when he took the stand, white as a sheet, he
                                       expressed satisfaction in all his dealings with me, complete satisfaction in
                                       the house and particularly expressed his satisfaction in the comfort of the
                                       heating system. The verdict was given against me all costs to be borne by
                                       me.

                                       or requirements or privileges. His lawyer may or may not advise his client
                                       on this point. In this case he did not and the client knew nothing of this

            <p><a name="d0e8698"></a>The judge then is the only one who takes any notes. He takes down what he
                                       pleases and leaves out what he pleases; in this case the client noticed and
                                       her barrister afterward commented on the fact to her that he took down none
                                       of her statements but only those of the opposite side. The judgment was for
                                       the Civil Servant and included extreme accusations of the architect though
                                       the defendant in his evidence had so completely admitted everything the
                                       architect had said that her lawyer said, "Well there is no need of
                                       cross-examining this man," and his lawyer said afterward to one of the
                                       architect's witnesses that it was a rotten judgment. It is supposed to be
                                       possible to appeal but this is in fact not possible as the architect's
                                       lawyer made clear to her since the higher court takes no evidence and can
                                       base its decision only on what the judge shows it. Since no stenographic
                                       notes had been taken there was nothing to put before a higher court.

                                       is helpless before the judiciary and this in the affairs that are supposed
                                       to be of most vital concern to the community. There is no court or judge
                                       before whom they can take their cases so they have to go from pillar to post
                                       asking this judge and that if they will be so kind as to take on this case.
                                       Frequently every one of the supreme justices will refuse to take on a Royal
                                       Commission. Then sometimes no State judge will act, then the Government goes
                                       hunting about for a barrister who will be willing to act. Naturally in a
                                       case that looks bad for the officials it will be extremely difficult to find
                                       anyone willing to take it on as, if a judgment against the officials is
                                       rendered, it means the end of that judge's career and if the truth is plain
                                       to the public it may be very trying to have to render judgment in their
                                       favor.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8709"></a>The system is one which presupposes that one will not be inclined to accept
                                       the position unless is has been made worth his while by one side or the
                                       other. As a rule all the favors are in the hands of the bureaucrats. Again
                                       the system is one that promotes corruption.

            <p><a name="d0e8779"></a>In a Chicago University Round Table discussion, Col. Knox suggested that the
                                       solution of the European problem would be for them to have a Union, not
                                       Political but Economic. This is a constructive idea for which type of
                                       concept we have urgent need. But it is not enough that we suggest what
                                       Europe should do, we should set her the example. The founders of our
                                       constitution gave a sound definition of the function of government - an
                                       organ to maintain Equity. No other country has been so favored as to have a
                                       correct concept. It definitely established the political government to meet
                                       the <u>moral requirements</u> of human beings in a community.
                                       Everywhere else welfare is the basis, and that means grab anything anywhere
                                       you can get it. It rests on the concept that might is right.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8785"></a>The century following the foundation of America has developed an economic
                                       life which is essentially a community affair since it is based on the
                                       division of labor. It is now plain that economic problems cannot be solved
                                       by individuals. To meet the <u>bodily needs</u> is now a
                                       community affair and requires a community organization. (See the Delaware
                                       River transformation.) This can function wholesomely only if it is
                                       independent of the political organization. Its laws are entirely different.
                                       Business cannot be run democratically. There can be no efficiency in
                                       business run by majority votes. Its law is mutuality, mutual <u>advantage</u>, not equity. An Economic Organization should consist of
                                       the total citizenry, not organized democratically but consisting of
                                       multitudinous economic associations, and which in its totality would have
                                       exact knowledge, based on experience, of all sides of economic affairs.

                                       political organ could then function freely in the maintaining of equity as
                                       it does in the problem of the traffic in our streets.

                                       different groups of people do not have the same moral standards. Human
                                       beings are different and would not be human beings if they were not
                                       different. But mutual advantage in business is a sound economic principle.
                                       Where is the easiest place in the world to put that concept into practice?

                                       when it comes to the economic organization we can, without confusion, have
                                       different units as was suggested - Europe, the Orient, the Americas - or a
                                       world Economic Organization, which would be the soundest of all for then we
                                       should have that type of organization where things are made and sold within

                                       present there is less animosity between individuals and groups here than
                                       anywhere in the world. The bitterness between classes in other parts of the
                                       world is something beyond the imagination of Americans.

                                       be done. And since we like all other communities are totalitarian, having
                                       but one organ to attend to community affairs, we throw up our hands even if
                                       we do not approve and say well the government must intervene. Even the big

                                       will take over their business and leave them paupers, have no constructive

                                       an economic organ if they would extend their thinking to broader lines.
                                       There should of course be no trying to bring this about by political means.

                                       Steiner - one organ to effect liberty, one to effect mutuality, and one to
                                       effect equity, the three needs of human beings in a community. That these
                                       three completely different functions cannot be carried out by one organ is
                                       axiomatic - as impossible as for the individual human being to carry our his
                                       three functions of digesting, circulation and thinking without the stomach,
                                       heart and brain organizations. It is equally obvious that there should be no
                                       central organization. Each must function independently though the fruits of
                                       each are used by all.

                                           Dwelling". In the New-York Historical Society copy the following is
                                           handwritten at the left of the illustration when it is oriented

            <p><a name="d0e8957"></a>Sometimes the maximum outlook from all the rooms in the house is attained not
                                       by courts or semi-courts but by terracing the house. The nature of the
                                       allotment on which it is to be built determines the type of house. The
                                       Fishwick house at Castlecrag - from its roof the one a half story above the
                                       other - commanded two valleys one to the South, the other to the East and
                                       North-east. The residents here spent much or their time and entertained
                                       their guests on these superb lookout terraces, and supplemented their garden
                                       with showy, blossoming plants annual and perennial.

            <p><a name="d0e8960"></a>A path down the valley leads directly to the open air theatre but before
                                       plays had been given there the dwelling itself had made charming settings
                                       for plays. In this case the living rooms are on the lower level, the
                                       bedrooms half a story above and the library a half story below.

            <p><a name="d0e8963"></a>The allotment is kite shaped, the only street frontage is on a circular drive
                                       with an interior monumental rock garden circle in the center, just
                                       sufficient to give the triple entrance to the dwelling, in the center the
                                       gold tiled walls of the front entrance, to the left the garage opening, to
                                       the right the entrance to the kitchen yard and the kitchen.

            <p><a name="d0e8966"></a>This is the only stub end street on the Crag and arose from the fact that the
                                       Council had forced a steep road down to the next level to give entrance to a
                                       boating reserve so the Castlecrag lower roads diverged from that.

            <p><a name="d0e8986"></a>Here were held musicals, for madam was a musician herself and, as customary
                                       in such town planned communities, each family centered on its particular
                                       field and genius in its often even grandiose affairs of hospitality. Here,
                                       before the valley theatre had yet been made available, was presented
                                       Goethe's "The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily" - his only fairy story. It
                                       is impossible to describe the loveliness of such a production. The guests
                                       packed the house including the areas of the windows outside. It was given in
                                       German this time. When presented in the valley later on it was in English
                                       and miraculously lovely.

                                       can lift liquids to such heights. But those who can see the four elemental

                                       our Sequoia Gigantea in height. Surrounded by these white skinned trees,
                                       smooth as satin, one can hardly believe it is true. The dwelling place of

                                       realm of time into the realm of space." The white bark of the Rubida does
                                       not need to be interpreted through the artist's technique. The flashes of
                                       yellow and blue and pink are there to make it living light even in the

            <p><a name="d0e9050"></a>There seems to be a general impression that Australia has almost no
                                       satisfactory trees for the streets of her cities when, in fact, she has an
                                       amazing number of perfect avenue trees with beauties and advantages hard to
                                       match anywhere in the world; yet an expression of appreciation of the
                                       exquisite native growths is apt to be met with ridicule. And not only are
                                       these trees evergreen and in perfect foliage all the year round but many of
                                       them have a long season of luxuriant and lovely bloom - white, orange,
                                       scarlet, yellow, blue - and the color of their barks runs a gamut surprising
                                       to one coming from a cooler climate.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9053"></a>To know how to plant the streets of Sydney or Melbourne one needs only to go
                                       tramping about the environing country where one would find in perfect
                                       condition the beautiful growths that covered the sites of the cities before
                                       they were devastated by the human grasshopper. Now, it is high time we were
                                       repenting of our sins and getting to work to replant these same trees. It is
                                       impossible to conceive a more beautiful tree that the Angophora Lanceolata,
                                       one of the most common trees about Sydney and of which beautiful specimens
                                       can be found in Melbourne; and the exquisite color of its smooth bark varies
                                       with the seasons from a warm gray to a lovely rose and cinnamon, becoming
                                       really brilliant against the rich tone of its foliage, so beautifully
                                       massed, setting off but not concealing the branches which grow in a curious
                                       liquid fashion quite contrary to the rule of thumb for drawing trees which I
                                       was taught - very picturesque. This is one of the old trees of Australia,
                                       the precursor of the Eucalyptus. Two other Angophoras are superb for avenue
                                       planting.

            <p><a name="d0e9056"></a>Ideal too are the Eucalypts. Occasionally we find some of these trees along

            <p><a name="d0e9075"></a>for this purpose. The Haemastoma, the white bark, the Eucalyptus Teretecornis
                                       of which I have seen a specimen 4 feet in diameter, a wonderful tree with
                                       all the ideal requirements for avenue planting, its bark banded with white
                                       and soft grey like a lovely drawing, its branching open, showing clearly
                                       through the foliage, its delicate foliage giving ample soft shade yet
                                       letting the breeze through. This, as many others of this family, as the
                                       rubida, the saligna and regnens, is perfect from an architectural point of
                                       view. While relieving the severity and coldness of the buildings it still
                                       leaves them visible as it does its own beautiful branches.

            <p><a name="d0e9078"></a>A short walk on the outskirts of Melbourne will bring one to splendid
                                       specimens of the Banksia, perfect in form for street planting. Among the
                                       Melaleucas, the dream tree, Styphelioides and Leucadendron. If you want
                                       dense shade, the splendid Eugenia Ventenatii or Ficus Rubiginosa or one
                                       stately and loss spreading Syncarpia, or for needle like delicacy of foliage
                                       the Casuarina. We can find native trees varying from the wide spreading to
                                       slender vertical forms; from dense mass to open growth; from deep rich
                                       greens to lovely grey or russet tones; from thick leaves to the daintiest
                                       possible, as in the Casuarina like a lovely mist.

                                       and so forth, and plant accordingly; but we need not limit ourselves to the
                                       re-planting of trees native to the immediate locality, for where individuals
                                       have been interested enough to experiment with others, we shall find many
                                       thriving beautifully which we have no right to deny at least a trial on our
                                       streets.

                                       Triplynervis, and Obovata, stately as possible with tall trunk same 80 feet
                                       high and a splendid spreading top. The Stenocarpus Sinuata, a miracle of a

            <p><a name="d0e9114"></a>There is no limit to the variety of our arboreal material for a variety of
                                       effects. In marked contrast to the Eucalyptus is the stately vertical trunk
                                       of the Agathis, a broad-leaved conifer growing to a hundred feet in height.
                                       If one wants to alternate trees of contrasting height and type, conceive the
                                       beauty of an avenue of the splendid Grevillea Robusta alternating with
                                       Callistemon Viminalis. The Grevilleas grow to a great height, ridged black
                                       bark, wonderful rich foliage, as graceful in manner of growth as the much
                                       talked about American Elm, with the added miracle of a season of gorgeous
                                       orange blossoms, alternating these with the multiple stemmed, ragged barked
                                       grey trunk, the new foliage red leaved and beautiful blossoms lasting a long
                                       season. In fact the long blooming season of most Australian trees and shrubs
                                       is an amazing thing to one accustomed to seeing the quickly disappearing
                                       blossoms of other regions.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9117"></a>Among other trees are the Castanospermum Australe, Flindersia, Fagus
                                       Australe, Lagunaria, covered in its season with tiny crab-apple like
                                       blossoms. Among the small avenue trees the Eugenia Touhmani and Tomlinsi,
                                       solid foliage from the ground up, Panax Elegans with its graceful stem and
                                       spreading top, or the lovely Archontophoenix Cunninghamii, smaller than but
                                       just as graceful and beautiful as the Royal Palm. What a stately colonnade
                                       these would form planted on either side of a lane, not too far apart, the
                                       straight grey shaft and the graceful capital; an endless number of trees
                                       perfect for avenue use.

                                       pigments but trees and shrubs and all the growing things, mostly native
                                       flora, and the local stone; knowing that a painter achieves his great
                                       effects by a restricted palette, thus achieving harmonies comprehensible and
                                       therefore acceptable to the human mind.

                                       indigenous to the locality - the palm-thatched villages of the tropics, the
                                       adobe and cliff dwellings of the Pueblo Indians, the hill cities of Italy

                                       great stretches of residences, and by far the greater part of a city is
                                       composed of residences. The raw odour of crude bricks, the chaotic
                                       hodge-podge of varied forms, the startling red clumsy roofs sloping to shed

            <p><a name="d0e9239"></a>The construction of this incinerator will permit garbage to be tipped from
                                       closed-body trucks or waggons from a tipping-room, reached by a ramp, into
                                       three hoppers, one each for the two furnaces for which provision is made
                                       (though one furnace is omitted pending increase of the population). The
                                       hoppers are separated from the truck dock by continuous steel covers and are
                                       ventilated through individual exhaust ducts operated by electric blowers
                                       into the combustion chamber of the furnaces. The battery of furnaces
                                       occupies a lower terrace story in front of the hall, and the garbage in
                                       these hoppers is directed through steel doorways from gantries over the
                                       furnaces which are charged from the hoppers generally, and directly operated
                                       by the individual stoker at each furnace by means of gear-operated hopper
                                       doors. Instead of the garbage being introduced directly to the fire,
                                       however, it is first received on a sloping drying hearth grate and passed
                                       through a blast of air heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. At the lower end of
                                       the sloping hearth is a residue chamber into which the clinker and ash are
                                       drawn by the stoker from a rear port, and the residue is tipped, as
                                       accumulated through horizontal revolving hopper doors into steel ash skips
                                       in an enclosed tunnel beneath, whence, free of all dust, the skip carts are
                                       withdrawn.

                                       nowhere else. Australia is not to be understood unless you understand Greek
                                       science with its classification of earthly things into 4 elements instead of
                                       the 19th century's science with its 90 or more, which theory the 20th
                                       century has broken down with the discovery of radio-activity which has
                                       already transformed some 60 elements into each other.

                                       can come close to it. It seems as if you could touch it, but you cannot feel
                                       it as you can the air. It is very beautiful. In seeing it you are seeing
                                       something not material as you are when you see a rainbow.

                                       over. So it is always. A thing to be done has to be done by one man. Thomas
                                       Jefferson in the 18th century established a democratic organization on a
                                       sound foundation with Equity as its basis.

            <p><a name="d0e9398"></a>The following century brought about a development in another field beyond the
                                       reach of the imagination of proceeding periods. This was in the economic
                                       field. Where is the man who will take the next step to follow Jefferson's,
                                       necessary for health in a human community? For like man himself a human
                                       community is a living thing. It cannot stand still, it must grow and
                                       develop. A hundred years have passed. The next step is urgent.

            <p><a name="d0e9404"></a>World economy is already here. It needs but a crystal to be thrown into the
                                       vat to crystallize it into an instrument for lack of which the world is
                                       perishing now - a World Economic Organization. America's appropriate task is
                                       to build the nucleus around which that world organization can crystallize.
                                       There surely cannot be a business man in our community now whose eyes have
                                       not been opened by the events of the last two years to the fact that anytime
                                       the government wants to it will take over his business and he will be a

                                       that power indiscriminately so long as there is but one instrument to attend
                                       to community affairs. Its power can be defined, limited, only if instruments
                                       are provided for meeting other community requirements than that of equity,

            <p><a name="d0e9428"></a>Material science came to its flower in the 19th Century. Through it a new
                                       technique has been developed in the material realm, that of providing for
                                       our bodily needs, that of Economics. It is in America that the practical
                                       effects of Jefferson's discriminating thinking gave the freest rein to
                                       economic life the consequences of which are continually being brought to our
                                       attention these days in statistics and publications of the wealth, ingenuity
                                       and enterprise of America compared with other communities - on which all the
                                       others are showing themselves to be more or less dependent at the present

            <p><a name="d0e9431"></a>It is for America to take the lead in solving these problems we are faced
                                       with now. America is the land of adventurers. Most of the adventurers of the
                                       world now have come here, for nowhere else were the doors open to them.
                                       Deeds are in the nature of adventures. Is there no one now among these men
                                       of deeds who will take the initiative in building up an Economic
                                       Organization? To do that one should not look for assistance from the
                                       political organ. It needs no new legislation nor need we bother our heads
                                       about old legislation. We cannot expect the political organ to diminish its
                                       own powers. But entirely outside of politics we can build up a complete
                                       Economic Organ which when established will stand on an equal footing with
                                       the political institution and, consisting as it must of the total citizenry,
                                       will quietly attend to its own affairs, that of buying and selling, leaving
                                       to the government only the task of maintaining Equity. Our efficiency would
                                       be enormously increased thereby and the further step of making it a
                                       world-wide organization would come of itself.

                                       which has savvy enough to realize that Dominion status is no good. Mexico
                                       next I think and China and also Ireland who has refused dominion status. And
                                       the dominions would begin to wake up and Canada and South Africa would
                                       follow and even Australia and New Zealand. And then the more perfected
                                       totalitarian states would begin

            <p><a name="d0e9469"></a>It is perhaps peculiarly American, but in fact there is not in the United
                                       States much interest in building up, in endowing families. In fact the usual
                                       parent feels a bit proud of having built up his own business or wealth and
                                       would love to be able to take pride in his son for doing the same himself.
                                       Out of this there has arisen the curious fact that over half the wealth in
                                       the United States is in the hands of women. Men would rather pass their
                                       wealth to their wives than to their sons. There quite likely are the "sixty
                                       families" but that is a bit ridiculous to the American. In consequence they
                                       have become the magnificent givers, their donations functioning all over the
                                       world. And that is as it should be. Now this method is one of the most
                                       important factors in a wholesome <u>Economic</u> system for as
                                       in a living being the getting and eating of food is a minor factor compared
                                       with the necessity of eliminating, at least one can live longer without
                                       eating than be can without eliminating, yet we have not been in the habit of
                                       considering the complete, absolute consumption of capital as being as
                                       necessary as its production.

                                       In fact one of our astronomers, Mr. Chamberlain <a name="297"></a> [Note: Thomas Chrowder
                                           Chamberlain?], based his ideas of the universe on this accretion
                                       theory. Shame on him! He's no true American. Americans believe in living. He
                                       belongs with the imperialists. The principle of subtraction, of
                                       discrimination, of elimination, is the essential of living kingdoms and our
                                       Solar System is a living thing.

                                       problem of an economic association can be tackled (because of its sufficient
                                       area and population) and solved because of an interesting fact. In the
                                       United States there is not the bitterness between employer and employee that
                                       exists elsewhere. You have to see it to believe that such venom can exist
                                       even in Australia which is supposed to be a workman's paradise. No month
                                       passes that some expression does not come before us in America of a
                                       realization on the part now of the employee, now of the employer, of the
                                       fact that the problem cannot be solved from the outside but that the
                                       solution must meet the necessities of both elements. Now in 1944 we are
                                       beginning to see the working together of labor and management to solve the
                                       economic problems, no longer so bitter a warfare.

                                       sells without his boundaries, in the other within. There is a whole world of
                                       difference. If one sells one's products beyond the boundaries he has no

                                       out of the clouds by giving it a body to function with, it will become
                                       apparent that patriotism does not mean a bond to a locality but to a soul
                                       conception. Strictly speaking that is the definition of a Political Organ.
                                       At present the United States is the only considerable country which has
                                       established itself on a moral concept. Since that is the only function of
                                       the political branch of a community the destiny of this concept is that it
                                       will become recognized as the basis for migration. People's allegiance will
                                       tend to take them to the terrestrial region where the moral standard as
                                       expressed in the Political Organ conforms with their own. No other

                                       one give an intelligible definition of what is called nationality, elsewhere
                                       they are tying the word up with matters which have no national significance.
                                       The boundaries of neither the economic nor the cultural organization need to
                                       conform to the national boundaries.

                                       community that has graduated from the dominion of the Folk Soul. To place
                                       herself under such a domination would be the greatest catastrophe. The next
                                       evolutionary step is to recognize humanity as your people, to become
                                       conscious of humanity as an entity and no longer be concerned with your well
                                       being or the well being of your particular district but only with the
                                       wholesome development of humanity which must, because of the nature of man
                                       as a distinct kingdom, be so constituted as to make possible the free
                                       development of the abilities of individuals, for each man constitutes a
                                       species, and must so function as to be able to adjust himself to the
                                       increasing diversity consequent. The communities who take this line will be
                                       carrying on evolution, the others will be retarding or dropping out of the

            <p><a name="d0e9665"></a>We see our people bewildered in many problems; railroading for instance where
                                       it is now apparent that unification is necessary if the railroads are to
                                       survive and yet the Political organ has passed Anti-trust laws to prevent
                                       unification. Unless we clear up our thinking it will almost certainly end in
                                       government ownership though it is still apparent to most that such cannot be
                                       efficient. Witness the railroads in Australia.

            <p><a name="d0e9668"></a>Such undertakings require men of business capacity and experience. If we
                                       could but recognize that the government's job is to maintain equity and if
                                       the easy way, the lazy way of taking over the business was out of court
                                       entirely, these railroad concerns could come together as a business
                                       association, employer, laborer, patron.

                                       car construction and sale, nor of trucks, nor does he have to equalize speed
                                       and power of the various types of transportation in order to maintain equity
                                       but has only to stand and see to it that all forms of transportation,
                                       whatever their power, vehicular or pedestrian, have equal opportunity to
                                       cross the streets, even if one of them be a cripple and so exceptionally
                                       slow. So with its task understood government could maintain equity without
                                       undertaking or managing business.

                                       cloistered central court garden which has proved in use in other countries

            <p><a name="d0e9699"></a>Mr. and Mrs. talked over their requirements, gave us the location of their
                                       lot in the outlying districts of Melbourne and told us to go ahead. Griffin
                                       solved the problem and I made the sketches. It was a rude shock to them
                                       both. Mr. Salter brought us the sad news telling us his wife said those
                                       Griffins were mad. Griffin chatted with him and he went home not quite so
                                       huffed. After a week or two he was back again saying they had gone over the
                                       plans again and again and always, to their surprise, found that in every
                                       detail it met their requirements perfectly. They found that the knitlock
                                       construction had enabled them to have bigger rooms and the court thrown in
                                       for nothing since its 2 1/4 inch walls required so much less area for
                                       construction and - mad or not - we were to proceed with the construction.

                                       exterior, was not only a saving but an advantage for durability. A light
                                       wash of pigment, wax and turpentine would give them all the interior finish
                                       needed and they could do it themselves if they wanted to. Inexpensive as it
                                       was it would hold its own in Melbourne's swank suburb, Malvern. The court
                                       enabled all the rooms to have at least two external walls and so windows and
                                       would of itself create a draft that would keep the house cool on hot days.
                                       And the heat is about all

                                       decoration as well as those of earlier civilizations were not imitations of
                                       nature but religious symbols. So in the decoration of this building the
                                       motifs of the decoration are not conventionalized physical forms but are
                                       rich expressions of the basic forces back of all nature.

            <p><a name="d0e9776"></a>This was Griffin's last work in Australia. In this he established firmly the
                                       interlocking of Town Planning and Architecture. One could not ask for a more
                                       telling monument to his work in this ancient continent. In the basic arts of
                                       architecture (in its broadest sense) and music (which is now making one with
                                       speech and motion) Australia is now ready to lead the world.

            <p><a name="d0e9779"></a>The 4 formative forces which have already manifested in nature express
                                       themselves in 4 basic forms or movements, the circular, triangular, wave and
                                       rectangular. Through these non-material forces all forms (matter) have been
                                       brought into the fixed forms called matter. These are the motifs of the
                                       decoration of this building. Within this building, a powerful expression of
                                       substantiality, matter reverses its steps moving from solid to liquid, to
                                       light to heat, and disappears. It would be absurd to say that something has
                                       been destroyed (other than form or appearance). That which had manifested is
                                       at the moment not manifesting as is the case with latent heat when water
                                           <a name="307"></a> [Note: "becomes steam" crossed out] passes from steam to latent

                                       feelings, as in the past, but by emotion controlled and directed by the
                                       trained intellect which, through discipline, can move on to conscious
                                       imagination and inspiration. After Griffin's death I saw a photograph of
                                       light. I don't know how it was made but it proved that light manifested in
                                       triangles. It was an exquisite and incredibly elaborate pattern of triangles
                                       and one could see in it how and in what manner light would progress and not

            <p><a name="d0e9839"></a>The warmth ether manifests in spheres. We glimpse here the origin of the
                                       solar system - nothing but the warmth condition of matter - the
                                       manifestation of the warmth force. This is the basic factor in incineration
                                       which takes all the refuse of the great city and reduces it to elements.
                                       Because of this method an incinerator can be placed anywhere, in a park or
                                       wherever a monumental building will emphasize a beautiful landscape. It can
                                       be right in the center of things for there is no unpleasantness in the
                                       process. Municipality after municipality realized this and adopted the
                                       method. The cost of the building was always included in the bid. Griffin was
                                       the architect of the company so every municipality had to accept the
                                       architect with the method, and the company so invariably won that the other
                                       competitors gave up bidding.

            <p><a name="d0e9842"></a>The light given off is represented by the triangular motif, very charming as
                                       used here but by no means as elaborate as light photographed. This is the
                                       creator of the gaseous condition of matter. The sound or chemical ether
                                       creates the crescent, the wave form. It is the force that brings liquidity
                                       into existence. We catch the connection of liquidity to sound in the wave
                                       movement which sound sets up and in the great increase of sounds in liquids.
                                       The wave form we see in the restless seas. The fire and liquid motifs are
                                       combined in the pattern of the outermost panel.

                                       rectangle are the base of the third panel. This is the form of the human
                                       blood crystals and also of the solid earth though erosion has rubbed off the
                                       corners of the primeval form.

                                       proved that the beautiful was less expensive than the ugly thing. In a time
                                       when people feared beauty, were suspicious of it, made a virtue of the lack
                                       of beauty he still gave it to them on their terms. The contractors
                                       themselves said this building was cheaper than if it had been built of brick
                                       in the usual way. The secret lay in the larger units, the saving in the
                                       erection.

            <p><a name="d0e9870"></a>The scientists of today do not understand what they have done in their so
                                       called breaking down of the atom, though the answer is clear before their
                                       eyes in the process that takes place. They never find the atom for there is
                                       no such thing but they witness matter moving from solidity to illumination
                                       (light), to heat with tremendous violence. In other words they transform
                                       matter into forces, a natural thing since all matter is created by forces,
                                       by Beings who use forces to bring things into manifestation. The so-called
                                       atom has no matter in it, only forces - magnetism, sound, light and warmth.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9873"></a>So the Greek knowledge has in the 20th century been proved correct. The
                                       forces are not vibrations of matter, but are the predecessors, the creators
                                       of matter. They were right in feeling that forces are credible but that
                                       matter is incomprehensible. The 4 which we experience today are warmth,
                                       light, sound and life. When we Westerners realize this which we have proved,
                                       the West and the East will have met. The created world will grasp the
                                       reality of the creating world and the creating world will acknowledge the
                                       created world. That is our task today and the health of the world is
                                       dependent on the understanding of this duality.

                                       to carry his message to them leading them beyond the Greek concept which was
                                       being imposed by Britain, and breaking down other barriers. No other
                                       language speaks so clearly and truly as architecture. Its history of

                                       played a great role in the play we gave - Mirrabooka - The Southern Cross -
                                       when the whole valley came to life with the blossoms and birds who were the
                                       characters in the aboriginal story of creation.

            <p><a name="d0e9909"></a>The Grass Tree is a very ancient form. They tell us it takes a hundred years
                                       for the trunk to grow an inch. Black boys they call them for they live
                                       through all the fires, their trunks, hard wood, surviving the heat and
                                       putting out new leaves. From it they make lacquer equal to the Japanese.
                                       From this sprang the first woman.

            <p><a name="d0e9928"></a>Then came the momentous decision to have the Anthroposophic Festivals, to
                                       awaken a greater consciousness of the significance of the seasons, at

                                       later to succeed Miss Mitchell, had translated into lovely rhythmic prose
                                       the Mystery of Eleusis by Edouard Schure. The Senor <a name="310"></a> [Note: Walter Burley
                                           Griffin] had set aside the Haven Valley for an open-air theatre
                                       and Mrs. Griffin was aflame to produce a play in the valley. The Castlecrag
                                       Dais <a name="311"></a> [Note: the Castlecrag dramatic club] had done creditable work for
                                       some years and had given one of Yeats' Cuchulain series - The Only Jealousy
                                       of Emir <a name="312"></a> [Note: Emer] - among whose characters were Spirits of the Moon
                                       - in the metropolis of Sydney. In her introduction she had, through
                                       Anthroposophic information, been able to relate the play to the realities of
                                       the moon realm and received the compliment that her introduction was as
                                       delightful as the play. But though it had been talked about, it had never
                                       been produced in the Valley.

                                       like a navvy <a name="313"></a> [Note: i.e., a construction laborer] along with the

                                       digging ditches and breaking stones. A stretch of the west side of the
                                       valley was terraced and faced with great stones to form seats for the
                                       audience; the other side and the head of the valley, a hundred feet above
                                       and down a hundred feet and more to the harbor, was the stage the loveliest
                                       ever seen. There were coastal Angophoras great and small with their

            <p><a name="d0e9982"></a>In Australia everything is evergreen, broad as well as narrow leaves, and all
                                       sorts of shapes. Instead of losing their leaves seasonally many lose their
                                       bark every year. This is especially conspicuous in the angophora. Each year
                                       the outer bark peels off completely leaving a pinkish cream, flesh colored
                                       bark smooth as satin. This gradually passes through several colors, a rosy
                                       silver grey becoming streaked with deep pink and gradually turning to a
                                       vivid crimson. This then splits and drops off at first exposing bits of soft
                                       flesh tone and then drops off entirely. The tree is a constant excitement
                                       the whole year through. Its masses of white clustered blossoms come
                                       according to the mood of the individual tree almost any time during the
                                       transition of one of Australia's seasons to the other for Australia has but
                                       two seasons. There are no native weeds in Australia, a perfectly balanced
                                       flora, but from month to month the fairies recarpet their domiciles with
                                       ever-changing colors and designs.

                                       took the lower part of the Valley and was followed by Olympia on the terrace
                                       above the wall with the mystic dance of the rainbow Aurora goddesses and the
                                       return of Demeter in wrath till the cry of Persephone is heard and Olympia

                                       lighted up in a superb tableau. The demons low in the valley have gathered
                                       about Pluto standing by the thrones, one of which Persephone has left to
                                       follow Hecate and Triptolemus up to the Higher realms, and the hermits in
                                       their wide-flowing lilac robes gather in lovely movement and form at the
                                       foot of the great wall, imploring. The valley becomes engulfed in darkness
                                       as Triptolemus brings Persephone before the throne of Zeus and, in a
                                       concentration of light, Dionysus appears from among the gleaming goddesses -
                                       the new god who succeeds Zeus - that prevision of the ancient mysteries of
                                       the coming of the Christ.

            <p><a name="d0e9999"></a>Such times we had at those first rehearsals, for all were very earnest! Our
                                       Zeus kept calling across from the audience banks that they couldn't be
                                       heard, I telling them that they were not to strain their voices, that they
                                       would be heard all right. Finally I asked him who was producing that play

                                       the worrying. On the evening of the play you could hear the softest sound.
                                       The valley was a perfect megaphone and our Anthroposophic knowledge - that
                                       sound is a function of the darkness as color is of light - was proved.

            <p><a name="d0e10016"></a>At Christmas time always a nativity play. There was always a changing
                                       personnel, never a pretense of dramatic technique (though usually there were
                                       one or two of dramatic experience with us) but always from the heart. The
                                       work was neither professional nor amateur. We achieved that truly wonderful
                                       thing, an unsophisticated drama. To our first Mary, with her perfection of
                                       beauty, when she first read her lines, I said - "You can't read these lines
                                       from the head. They must be read from the heart. I know you haven't got a
                                       heart but you must lay aside your intellect. See what you can do." A few
                                       days later she rang me on the phone saying - "I have a heart!" "Well show
                                       me," I replied. And show me she did. And so with all the young folk. They
                                       sprang to the opportunity of expressing themselves spiritually, simply
                                       thrilled just to be in and a part of great spiritual work. The audience
                                       would sit the two hours long on their hard stones and no backs, breathless,
                                       enchanted. "It doesn't seem real," you would hear.

                                       led in by angel children and praying at her prie-dieu; the shepherds
                                       climbing the slopes from below and building their bonfire; the kings with

                                       above their heads. Gradually they moved down the hill taking formations as

                                       walking on air. The music - flute and violin - played by angels. The cherubs
                                       clustered around Mary, and the speech chorus, who had spoken first from the

                                       Those who saw this fairy story felt they were living in fairyland itself. It
                                       wasn't a drama one was watching. It was a new experience in life. The old

                                       rocks and driving her disobedient sons away with curses when they brought
                                       her flowers instead of herbs; their wanderings and adventures across the
                                       valley and encounters with fairies dancing among the shrubs and gnomes from
                                       the gnarled roots of the great trunked tree, and the perfection of the
                                       illusion of the final battle of the youngest son with the fabulous bull in a
                                       rocky crevasse watched and screened by the circle of Egyptian mummies with
                                       their incantations. His victory in this last adventure marked his final

                                       tiny structure which gave the impression of a great castle for the knitlock
                                       material, which needs no mortar however complicated the forms, was used and
                                       the structure placed just over the crest of the hill with a strategic bit of
                                       tower here and there so that one felt there was in fact a great castle just

                                       the harbor below that it became a vital part of the scene, whence Orestes
                                       came and found his sister.

            <p><a name="d0e10050"></a>On the day that Iphigeneia was given my telephone bell rang and a man's voice
                                       inquired about the play to be given in the evening. I learned later that it
                                       was Dr. Kakatakus, the newly arrived Greek Consul-General. He had come to
                                       Australia with quite the European concept that it was the land of wild
                                       barbarians and was astounded to find in the hotel bulletin the notice of the
                                       production of one of his country's great plays. To direct anyone in Sydney
                                       is not easy and he evidently was a stranger so I suggested he take a taxi,
                                       but if he didn't want that expense to take a bus to our shops where there
                                       was a shopkeeper who would taxi him down to the theatre. He followed this
                                       latter suggestion telling the lad to have the taxi wait at the door of the
                                       theatre. Of course there was no door, the theatre being the valley, so Joss
                                       brought him down around the valley road and presently heard the exclamation,
                                       "My God!" and as he went on, again, "My God!" The Consul was perhaps fearing
                                       for his life on this lonely way with precipice on either side. But a few
                                       moments and he was in the midst of the gathering and fell into the hands of
                                       Miss Lute Drummond, who is music personified and the founder of opera in
                                       Australia. Since she was about to start around to give her always charming
                                       preliminary esoteric introduction to the play, she passed him on to Miss

                                       stairway as she herself swung around the temple terrace to her sacrificial
                                       ceremonies. <a name="319"></a> [Note: Edward] Burne-Jones' picture of the Blessed Damosels
                                       descending the stairs can give a hint of the loveliness of these movements.
                                       Orestes and his friends who had been tossed on these unknown shores were
                                       addressed as they approached the foot of these stairs by Iphigeneia above,
                                       surrounded by her priestesses. Here in this temple forecourt the enraged
                                       King of Tauris was appeased by the appearance in the temple forecourt of
                                       Diana herself, and the wonderful procession was formed to follow Iphigeneia
                                       carrying the sacred statue down the steps with maidens and soldiers
                                       following, wending their way across the valley and up the hillside, across
                                       the top terrace and down disappearing as they made their way to the water's
                                       edge. Surely it is in such ways as this that our young people should become
                                       familiar with the majestic literature of these earlier civilizations. We all
                                       became worshipers of Diana and the moon that night.

                                       effect of all the illuminated figures in eloquent poses was dream-like and
                                       almost incredible like that of a highly imaginative painting. One thought of
                                       Fra Angelico and his multitudes of angels. The acoustics of the dell were
                                       remarkably good. Every word carried clearly even from the most distant crag.
                                       Some of the distinctness, of course, was due to the excellence of the
                                       speaking. All the actors, and the chorus too, realised the large scale of
                                       utterance and gesture which such a place and such a play demanded, a play

                                       between democracies and dictators. Creon's sudden outbursts, when they came,
                                       were memorably intense; and their effect was redoubled by an eerie echo

                                       natures in great ensembles with their fellow beings. We saw what was their

                                       surprising to all of us to find what a complete and perfect drama it is and
                                       how one could almost speak of it as the most popular play we gave though the
                                       continued strain of piety in it is very foreign to most of our people at
                                       present. We had a curious experience with the youth who took the part of
                                       Everyman. Greek-like himself in face and figure and quite a bit of dramatic
                                       experience and quite equal to the handling of the great role (he had done
                                       Orestes with us) but when we had but two or three more rehearsals ahead of
                                       us he came to us and said we'd better drop the play; he couldn't go on with
                                       the role - he couldn't learn it. Of course I said it would not be possible
                                       to drop the play; I'd find someone else to take the role. Such situations

                                       of a performance. But after leaving him a few days I suggested he come in
                                       and have a chat with me. He said he simply could not memorize the lines. I
                                       told him I quite understood, the reason was that this was an initiation play
                                       and he was out of sympathy with the Christian initiation but that it would
                                       be a great experience for him if he conquered this antipathy and that I
                                       would undertake to drill the part into him. So for the next two weeks he
                                       came to me every day and I rehearsed him line by line until we had broken
                                       down the inhibition. He gave a superb performance of, one of the richest and
                                       most varied of roles, in which Everyman depicts the whole range of every

                                       how to do, so as to perceive in the causal realms; what wonderful
                                       opportunities we could give our young people. How we could then feed their

                                       which we can experience the causal realms with the same precise, checkable
                                       knowledge that has mastered the mineral kingdom during the past five hundred
                                       years? Only so can we master the three other kingdoms of vegetable, animal
                                       and man.

                                       surrounded them, taking part in the great dramas of past civilizations which
                                       through spiritual science they could understand, eager to reach deep into
                                       the significance of the lore of the ancient people of their own continent,
                                       these two girls studied with seeing eyes the Mythology of the Australians.
                                       Out of this was born the genius of a young Shelley. The play, Mirrabooka,
                                       was presented in the Haven Valley where long ago this ancient people had
                                       dwelt and where one of the eight great supporting columns of Heaven, the
                                       Angophora, stood majestic, the dwelling of Yaraan.

                                       the City of Port Stephens which will ultimately become the New-York of
                                       Australia. It was surveyed, plotted and all the lots sold and there it
                                       rests. England does not want it to come into being but wants to hold this
                                       superb port in the control of the British navy. Beautiful Australia,
                                       pathetic Australia. Almost without exception probably the American who goes
                                       to Australia goes with the conviction that it is a democracy, perhaps even
                                       more of a democracy than the United States, but it takes but a very short
                                       time to find how far this is from the truth, and a long stay invariably
                                       fills one with dismay at the hollowness of this outward pretension. These
                                       conditions are not the result of war but were entirely fixed and apparent
                                       before the war.

                                       finds oneself in an atmosphere more European than Europe, nowhere a feeling
                                       of equality between man and man but the most amazing class feeling. We learn
                                       that in America no one knows what the word class means as understood in
                                       Europe and Australia, and in the latter country a bitterness of feeling
                                       difficult to comprehend. One rarely hears a conversation that does not
                                       express class animosity. One searches for causes underlying and touches on
                                       such revered customs as that of granting titles, an acknowledgement that
                                       they believe it is right for certain <u>subjects</u> to consider
                                       themselves superior to others and the root of this disease forthwith poisons
                                       the whole community. We stand amazed at the consequence of things we are in

                                       men "back home." Australia has a navy you think but though built by
                                       Australians' money the moment it is launched it becomes English and is no
                                       longer under the control of Australia. A man who has civil rights under the
                                       laws of Australia as long as he keeps his foot on land but the minute he is
                                       on the water he is no longer under the Australian law but under the English
                                       law. And now that the war is on though Australia has refused conscription he
                                       can under those circumstances be conscripted. Australia decides to build a
                                       Parliament House but English architects want the job so the international
                                       competition for it is stopped. The requirement for this came directly from
                                       England. A tenant wished to remodel a building and must wait months for
                                       permission and approval of drawings by the owner in London. The statistical
                                       statement of the wealth of Australians shows practically no rich men and but
                                       a few well-to-do men. Australia's wealth is drained into English pockets.

                                       the Australian aboriginal is the lowest type of human being with so little
                                       intelligence that he can count only to three. But human beings cannot be so
                                       segregated. The Australian natives are the Paradise people. Man's history up
                                       to the present time has been a descent into matter. We have become almost
                                       mechanical. It is up to us now to start the ascent into the spiritual.

            <p><a name="d0e10372"></a>During our first year in Australia we learned of Mr. David, a full blooded
                                       aboriginal, who had just completed his university course in higher
                                       mathematics and received his degree in the University of Sydney. A jolt like
                                       this breaks down the whole structure of one's prejudices. It prepared us for
                                       realizing the fact that no longer are there real distinct races though
                                       certain physical characteristics remain temporarily in groups, for the
                                       physical body is to a certain extent still dominated by heredity. With the
                                       coming of the Christ races ceased to exist for the Christ gave that "light
                                       which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" to all men and this
                                       light, which is the Ego, makes all men equal in that it wipes out all
                                       limitations to their powers to develop their individual selves.

                                       Baber, a professor of Pedagogy and Geography in the University of Chicago,

                                       Zealand and Australia. She told us she had always asked the teachers she
                                       encountered whether they had ever been able to distinguish any difference of
                                       mental capacity in their pupils which they could attribute to difference of
                                       race, and the universal answer had been in the negative.

                                       strange to find what seemed to me a lack of capacity for a white person to
                                       understand someone of another race when he later in the book told how Susie
                                       had gone back to her people as if she had sort of reverted to the aboriginal
                                       when it seemed to me so apparent that she had slipped away from her adopted
                                       parents out of thoughtfulness for them because they had been obliged to
                                       barricade their home and maintain almost military defenses against the
                                       determination of Susie's people to get her back to marry her to an old man
                                       to whom the tribe had allotted her. It seemed to me that Susie deliberately
                                       gave herself up to them to put an end to this trying situation for the
                                       family of her beloved friends.

                                       when European property owners at times, dwelling on opposite sides of a
                                       stream, made a sport of shooting the black folk as they swam to the shore on
                                       one side and then, when they swan back in desperation to the other side,
                                       shooting them again as they approached the opposite shore, back and forth,
                                       back and forth - "great sport" like Kipling's in Africa.

                                       after having dedicated it to the aboriginals always driving the natives out
                                       if in the barren districts to which they have been allocated they happen to
                                       find a mode of livelihood, as by discovering good oyster beds. Then again
                                       the whites take possession and drive them further on in consequence of which
                                       naturally it is bound to happen that in the need for food the aboriginal
                                       occasionally steals from the neighboring whites. The method generally used
                                       under these circumstances is that the white people put out where it can be
                                       found flour with poison in it. The natives finding this and taking it die.
                                       This is still done though in some groups the natives have come to realize
                                       that it is not

            <p><a name="d0e10426"></a>At one time I spent a fortnight in Tasmania with three other artists on a
                                       sketching outing. One was a poet and I found that she was well versed in
                                       aboriginal lore. I checked with her a story Mark Twain told, already
                                       confirmed by a Melbourne Doctor, that the aboriginal problem had been
                                       disposed of in Tasmania by sterilizing them. This story was of how a warlike
                                       group was approached by a kind hearted man, and courageous - Mr.
                                           <a name="336"></a> [Note: George Augustus?] Robinson, who won them to confidence in
                                       white folks and brought them down from the hills to enter into a treaty on a
                                       promise Governor <a name="337"></a> [Note: George?] Arthur had made to him. They were
                                       greeted by pomp and ceremony by the Governor and people and amicable
                                       arrangements were entered into. This friend so far confirmed Mark Twain's
                                       story <a name="338"></a> [Note: in "Following the Equator"?]. So I asked her what happened
                                       afterward - what became of the aboriginals. She said - "Oh, they petered
                                       out." We had been discussing the question of the superiority of one race
                                       over another and she had been very positive in her feeling for the
                                       superiority of the whites, I arguing for the dark-skinned people. So I asked
                                       her if the aboriginals had been sterilized to which she answered. "Yes."
                                       Then I said, "Do you think that is evidence of the superiority of the white
                                       folks," She said - "Oh yes; the blacks would have done the same if they had
                                       been smart enough to think of it first." We did not continue the discussion.

                                       having found a cave on the estate with important records of the aboriginals.
                                       He said he had heard we were giving Greek plays on the other side of the
                                       valley and thought it would be interesting to have in the publication he was
                                       about ready to get out a photograph of the Gods as we were depicting them in
                                       that same valley, the home of the aboriginals. We had one of Diana appearing
                                       before the temple to persuade the King to let Iphigeneia and Orestes return
                                       to Greece, which I gave him. He was very enthusiastic over the records he
                                       had found showing the mathematical understanding of these people. He said,
                                       "They tell us that

            <p><a name="d0e10467"></a>the Greeks invented this, but I have found evidence that they got it from the
                                       Australian natives; and that the Egyptians were the first to comprehend this
                                       other thing, but they got it from the Australian aboriginals. I knew that he
                                       was more correct than the others but that all these early peoples got such
                                       knowledge from the same source, not from each other - from inspirational or
                                       intuitive thinking, direct from spiritual sources. Quite recently those who
                                       are investigating sympathetically - that is without preconceived conclusions
                                       - are finding continued confirmation of the native Australians' power to do
                                       many things quite beyond the reach of our modern civilization which more and
                                       more limits its perception to material things letting other perceptive
                                       organs atrophy. There are things that we would do well to investigate
                                       without prejudice and things that we should learn how to do. I am not a
                                       student of the aboriginals nor is this the place to go into details on the
                                       subject, but it is well authenticated that when groups of natives find life
                                       under the present circumstances unendurable their leader will announce that
                                       on a certain day the tribe will die and on that day they die not through
                                       physical means; and that when groups of white adventurers are in perilous
                                       situations, when supplies are gone, the black guide may tell them that help
                                       is coming, in two days it will be there - in two days the help has come.

                                       there is no such thing as racial superiority today and that apparent
                                       differences arise not from difference of faculty but from difference of
                                       circumstance and that advantage to all will derive from a social system
                                       which will see to it that all men have the opportunity to develop their

            <p><a name="d0e10500"></a>The Casuarina is one of the very old species, like our Equisitum whose needle
                                       like leaves are jointed and can be pulled apart at the joints, only this
                                       horsetail is grasslike whereas in Australia the Casuarins is a tree. Its
                                       clusters of needles are lacelike against the sky, and in the forest are like
                                       a mist floating about among the other trees. They are almost black-barked,
                                       grow along the coast and some species grow right in the salt water. In this
                                       they are like the mangroves which are common in Sydney Harbor.

            <p><a name="d0e10503"></a>FICUS. - My first rage in Australia was the destruction of an avenue of Ficus
                                       Macrofolia. Port Phillip of Melbourne has its characteristic Fig Trees as
                                       has Queensland and so has Port Jackson of Sydney, both huge and grand trees
                                       and more shrubby types. Such a contrast these make with the casuarina. In
                                       Australia the shrubs and trees just tell you they can do anything. They can
                                       even live through long droughts without turning a hair so to speak. In
                                       perfect condition they just stop growing and then when the rain comes, a
                                       year, two years, they rush their growth at top speed. This I think is
                                       because of their oils.

            <p><a name="d0e10506"></a>The fig is a sort of rubber plant and it pours its roots fantastically over
                                       the rocks till the gnomes make some entry open in the rocks for then to
                                       enter. The gnomes don't bother with them till all the other plants have been
                                       attended to. The fig foliage is a solid mass. It lets no atmospheric
                                       moisture pass it by but makes use of it all. That is where the Undines are
                                       at work. In the waterfalls is where they play.

                                       the East a flat terrace above the eye so scenes can appear and disappear
                                       across it, mysterious or spectacular. Then the little stream flowing down to
                                       the sea, its head and its further bank offering a rich range of settings -

                                       Humanity had to lose that faculty temporarily in order to be able to reason
                                       - to think, and to function with free will. That accomplished we must,

                                       which I myself<br> Have felt and striven for. So canst thou read<br> The
                                       story of thy quest in this I give thee.<br> Once the wise Sun Mother lived
                                       among us<br> In endless day, and all our ways were love;<br> Yet for this
                                       earth too fine her gentle spirit,<br> And when she left me, far away to
                                       dwell,<br> I thought my empty heart must break for grief,<br> For grey,
                                       unlovely loneliness; and muted<br> Was the voice of these pale waters.
                                       Despair<br> Lent me strength, and Oh so much I loved her,<br> My Sun
                                       Mother, that I left my narrowed bed<br> And rose and rose, far up beyond
                                       the earth,<br> Now palled in darkness. But who can span<br> Another's
                                       destiny? I could not reach her.<br> At last, worn out with grief, forlorn I
                                       fell<br> To rest on every bush and flower<br> In glistening tears of dew.
                                       Then, as a blossom<br> Bursting into bloom, the sky filled with her
                                       light,<br> And her warm love transforming me, lightly<br> I floated up as
                                       vapour. Thus easily<br> That great heart throbbed across the void of
                                       earth<br> And Heaven! O Pilgrim, thus thy fate,<br> To seek and strive and
                                       still to fail until<br> In thine own spirit shall forever shine<br> The
                                       true Sun's mighty ray.

                                       When but a little while ago, upon us lay<br> The sabled darkness and we
                                       entangled were<br> In filaments of evil that bound our thought<br> To
                                       Earth, then, when misery made the whole world mute,<br> I seemed to stand
                                       upon an ancient forest floor -<br> And thou and all of these were of my
                                       life<br> And part of me - A tide of feeling rippled<br> Through the green
                                       ghost world. The trees bowed stately heads.<br> A little fleck of sunshine
                                       that lost itself<br> Within the raptured woods, touched my dancing
                                       feet<br> With beauty. Far-off a bird sang, so sweetly<br> That almost life
                                       itself had ceased to be<br> To make its life immortal. My breath<br>
                                       Caught itself upon the listening quiet<br> And froze into a tracery of
                                       still,<br> Uncaptured loveliness, a starry Form<br> For thee to fill with
                                       substance,<br> My heart, faint with an unknown tenderness,<br> Yearned
                                       upward to the heavens, and Gentle Hands<br> Caught mine. Silver threaded
                                       mist clung closely<br> To that Shape of Love, and I that ever longed<br>
                                       To link myself with Beauty's inmost grace<br> Now found delight and those
                                       dumb dreams<br> That never would have known an earthly waking,<br> Soft as
                                       the morn's first sigh, around me winged<br> Radiant, into the limitless
                                       light of heaven.<br> Through airy avenues of skyless space
