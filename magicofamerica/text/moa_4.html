                                       (which had been necessary to bring about the individualizing of men) into
                                       creative thinking which would give them freedom in the true sense of the

                                       differs essentially from past periods in that human beings are no longer

            <p><a name="d0e1317"></a>Louis Sullivan was the founder in America of modern architecture and has had
                                       perhaps more influence in Europe than in America, at least an architecture
                                       no longer under the domination of ancient forms; but with the private
                                       ownership of land, which unfortunately succeeded Federal control in the
                                       United States, the development of architecture was stymied until the
                                       profession of community planning, which alone could give architecture a free
                                       chance in post-feudal times, was established by Walter Burley Griffin and
                                       the University of Illinois. This has still dragged because only by a unified
                                       control of considerable areas of ground could much town planning, and
                                       therefore architecture, blossom.

                                       private ownership of land. This can be brought about wholesomely only when
                                       the Threefold organization is effected. This is at present expressed, though

                                       now. In earlier civilization the overlords lived in close centers. The
                                       people, farmers, spent their days in the broad surrounding open spaces. The
                                       ancient type of city was properly planned for its time and has great beauty
                                       and magnificence. In our industrial civilization only the overlords can
                                       afford to live in the wide open spaces. The citizens, the workers, are
                                       packed into the cities, great space but solidly packed, slums and nothing
                                       but slums, but the wealthy can escape from their more expensive slum
                                       districts.

            <p><a name="d0e1343"></a>Now the problem of putting Chicago to rights in the matter of residential
                                       requirements was solved in the 2nd decade of this century in a competition
                                       fostered by the Chicago architects. The solution could be applied to any
                                       part of the city as well as to all the outlying districts which have been
                                       settled and are still to be settled during the succeeding decades. Nothing
                                       has been done correctly because the man who solved the problem went to the
                                       antipodes where he died. One other architect has put forth this same plan
                                       except that he has used only the suggested economy of the street arrangement
                                       and squeezed out all the open spaces to add more streets and more
                                       congestion. This plan has been published in the news papers recently. It
                                       would be a crime to use it. But why not use the original plan. I can think
                                       of no reason except that each architect feels that he should respect in
                                       others what he demands for himself, claiming that what he designs belongs to
                                       him. So they continue to grope around for some other answer and nothing else
                                       is the answer. So a professional vice is holding up the carrying into effect
                                       of this vital work and slumdom continues to be universal in all the
                                       residential districts of Chicago. For a residential district which does not
                                       provide direct access from homes to open spaces without the crossing of
                                       thoroughfares

                                       read the remembered. Twenty years later, in Australia, when he found a
                                       flower described in Bailey's he could name it.

            <p><a name="d0e1366"></a>One of his basic works there was training the citizenry not to destroy
                                       nature. Though younger than <a name="31"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright he was
                                       practicing architecture while Wright was still in Sullivan's office, and
                                       when he entered into partnership with Wright the work immediately reflected
                                       his <a name="32"></a> [Note: Griffin's] influence. Wright himself called my attention to
                                       this fact.

            <p><a name="d0e4353"></a>Of course the new type will differ as radically from English, Scotch or Welsh
                                       or Irish prototypes as climate, temperament and social conditions are
                                       divergent.

            <p><a name="d0e4356"></a>Cottages in Britain are pretty in their very pettiness and fit naturally into
                                       little isolated villages. Here dwellings must be congregated in enormous
                                       colonies.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4359"></a>The old standard was that of individual effort, or handicraft, crudity and
                                       inefficiency. The new is of cooperative effort, machinery precision and
                                       economy. The former provided physical protection to the human animal. The
                                       latter must afford, in the home, comfort and facilities for sedentary
                                       pursuits and the nourishing of intellectual growth.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4362"></a>So might an infinitude of parallels be drawn, all pointing to the foolishness
                                       of attempting to bind ourselves with the very shackles that determined the
                                       old styles, which is the very thing we do when we look to precedent for our
                                       inspirations.

            <p><a name="d0e4365"></a>In a sentence, the conditions and the environment require an intelligent

            <p><a name="d0e4368"></a>To produce a modern style we must first master the possibilities and
                                       comprehend the reasonable limitations of our new and complicated
                                       constructive media. Whereas of old the architect need merely be familiar
                                       with the economies of simple masonry and carpentry, today it is a question
                                       of the science of engineering, and then not only static, but embracing
                                       equipment and distributive systems that are dynamic. Only the student
                                       inducted into engineering, versed in the technique, is in a position to
                                       apply and develop in architecture those basic laws that govern our
                                       intuitions of time and space, or line, mass and proportion which apply to
                                       the eye just as to the ear do those of rhythm and harmony in music.

            <p><a name="d0e4371"></a>Now, would you venture to indicate how a national type of architectural art
                                       could be evolved for Australia?

            <p><a name="d0e4408"></a>In one of his very early jobs - that of his brother's dwelling in
                                       Edwardsville, near St. Louis, Griffin introduced a quite new type of
                                       dwelling. Here already the second story continuous sill line was
                                       established.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4411"></a>This again was not a merely superficial but basic architecture which lies in
                                       the plan primarily and not purely in superficialities. Griffin was a
                                       conserver of space.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4414"></a>In our cold climates where heat for winter has to be supplied he did not
                                       simply install a basement under the whole house only a small part of which
                                       was needed for the heating systems of that time but leaving about half the
                                       basement for such uses dropped some of the living quarters to the ground
                                       level. In this case the living room thus became a story and a half high.
                                       Down half a dozen steps from this level and one was in the billiard room.
                                       There was still plenty of space for the heating apparatus.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4417"></a>A half story up from the living room were the dining room and the library
                                       which thus became a balcony of the Living Room. A story above these are the
                                       bed rooms.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4420"></a>In this as in most of his buildings he laid out a landscape and planting
                                       plan. The location of the dwellings by no means followed the rule of thumb
                                       of the usual methods of placing the house on the lot. Many advantages were
                                       won in this way.

                                       pace with science, as that has clarified the phenomena of sound, and with
                                       the mechanical progress that has opened new avenues of musical expression.

                                       since ideas arise in a human mind, when that has happened the way is open to
                                       all humanity to carry on and develop the work. The foundation has been laid.
                                       Louis Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was
                                       felt as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully there in the
                                       early decades. Personal vanities and claims obstructed it here, especially
                                       the widely [publicized] <a name="39"></a> [Note: supplied from similar passage at

                                       was brought home to me when I saw the revolution in methods and results that
                                       took place when landscape was made a part of architecture. It meant not only
                                       a broadening of the view but a positiveness of action arising from the firm
                                       foundation of definite facts determining the general scheme before taking up
                                       details of internal requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean
                                       gardening as an afterthought to a building but means a consideration of the
                                       external

                                       the character of the surrounding buildings have sometimes to be taken
                                       advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. And we must consider not the mere
                                       personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it
                                       is curiously true that a thing to be a real and permanent advantage to one
                                       must be an advantage to everyone, just as in the animal or man a sound organ

            <p><a name="d0e4519"></a>My first object lesson was the case of a house the working drawings of which
                                       had been completed, and accepted by the owner and the contract let, when it
                                       was first subjected to the criticism from this fundamental standpoint, when
                                       Griffin entered into partnership with the architect <a name="42"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd
                                       Wright]. The lot was one next to a two-story flat building with its
                                       porch built close to the sidewalk line. Across the street from the flat
                                       building was a beautiful park. The house criticized was being set back on
                                       the lot as if shrinking from an ugly thing of which it was afraid, leaving
                                       the greater part of the grounds to the front, allowing the other building to
                                       look over it destroying its privacy and shutting off from the client the
                                       delightful view opposite, the home garden dominated by this ugly building.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4525"></a>A knowledge of the conditions of the surroundings led to the flat criticism
                                       that although the design was charming it was not the right answer, this was
                                       not the proper plan for the location, words which meant nothing to the
                                       designer who was only an architect, to whom town planning was a closed book.
                                       Griffin suggested that the living rooms be elevated above the eyes of the
                                       passer-by lifting the basement out of the ground, and that the house instead
                                       of being a parallelogram should be ell shaped, and that the whole building
                                       be brought forward alongside the flat building and so acting as a screen

                                       had been under with Mr. Sullivan.

            <p><a name="d0e4539"></a>While this was going on I was told to make sketches for an abstract 2 story 3
                                       bed-room house which I did. This gave me an experience of why the Chinese
                                       tipped up the overhanging eaves though expressed in modern scientific terms
                                       of forces of gravity instead of demons - a reality in whatever terms
                                       expressed. I guess I was never a conformist. Any <a name="44"></a> [Note: Anyway?] it was
                                       a cruciform plan. Later on when I had left the office and Griffin was in
                                       partnership there an amazing thing happened. He told me one day several
                                       years later of his first experience there. A residential job had come into
                                       the office and the two men went into a competition for it. He mentioned the
                                       name of the client and I was wide-eyed thinking he was going to say he won
                                       it. Why otherwise should a man be telling me about it. But he said he lost,
                                       and I laughed and told him that house had been built exactly in accordance
                                       with my design - that first one. It was a revolutionary design, abandoning
                                       the universal parallelogram, T shaped, and center reception entrance hall
                                       dropped to ground level. His losing in that competition was doubtless a
                                       unique experience in that office. His revolutionizing of the work in that
                                       office was first expressed in the <a name="45"></a> [Note: Frank W.] Thomas House.

            <p><a name="d0e4548"></a>Later this architect went abroad. He asked me to take over the office for
                                       him. I refused. But after he had gone Mr. <a name="46"></a> [Note: Herman] von Holst who
                                       had taken over asked me to join him so I did on a definite arrangement that
                                       I should have control of the designing, that suited him. When the absent
                                       architect didn't bother to answer anything that was sent over to him the
                                       relations were broken and I entered into a partnership with von Holst and
                                       Fyfe. For that period I had great fun designing.

            <p><a name="d0e4554"></a>While the construction of the home of Henry Ford was being carried on,
                                       presentation sketches were made for Mr. <a name="47"></a> [Note: C.H.] Wills. At this
                                       period I too followed the Japanese feeling. It was not till a short time
                                       afterward, when I entered Griffin's office, that I realized the difference.

            <p><a name="d0e4601"></a>This is a minimum cost house. It has corner fenestration but beautiful
                                       instead of the teeth knocked out which has so widely followed this type of
                                       construction which substitutes tensile for compressive members so universal
                                       before. This with all its ornament is as cheap as the usual barren examples
                                       as was proved in the incinerator in Sydney, Australia, where the whole wall
                                       is highly ornamented.

            <p><a name="d0e4615"></a>The design herewith illustrated is an example of the kind of improvement
                                       projected for a neighborhood group of houses being planned for the 9 acre
                                       rectangular plot of land lying just West of the New Trier High School
                                       Community Center in Winnetka, Illinois. This house is one of the group to be
                                       started at the break of Spring that will comprise the first installment of a
                                       series of 36 small fireproof cottages that represent an attempt to
                                       demonstrate some of the advantages of recently developed practical and
                                       esthetic principles for the layout of small home groups.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4618"></a>Among the advantages, besides the generally recognized saving in wholesale
                                       building operation, especially for fireproof structures are:- Greater
                                       utilization of the ground and openness of view, first through clustering
                                       together and thus concentrating the public thoroughfare and service
                                       functions of the house to leave wider, freer ground space for private use
                                       and preservation of the rural character; secondly, by arranging the clusters
                                       with respect to each other to give vistas from all principal rooms extending
                                       over at least two unobstructed lots in each direction; thirdly, in the
                                       combination and composition of units of simplest forms, single little
                                       houses, into picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and
                                       hedges with tree and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house, that
                                       alone would be an unmitigated box, into an appropriate link of a rambling,
                                       cozy, private community home of separate wings, bays and pavilions, such as
                                       might constitute the dream of the useless overgrown Castle in Spain toward
                                       which each of us is so often selfishly and aristocratically inclined.

            <p><a name="d0e4621"></a>The site of this one isolated house unit that will mark the starting point
                                       terminates an extension of Alles Road eastward to a small circular park
                                       which will effect this road's diversion to the north and also form the
                                       northern terminal of Bertling Lane that is

            <p><a name="d0e4629"></a>to run southward to a similar circle planting screening its south entrance
                                       from Winnetka Avenue.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4632"></a>Located focally this house can take on a somewhat more decorative and special
                                       character than is intended for the remaining ones. In its function of a high
                                       Studio Living Room, it is afforded some distinction, and perforated concrete
                                       geometric tracery for the frieze windows of opalescent color glass for this
                                       room, and the conservatory as well, gives the single motive that is utilized
                                       to characterize the whole design. Not only outside is the characterization
                                       intended but inside also in fireplace, sideboard and grilles, rendered
                                       possible through the elimination of wood trim or fixtures, wood being used
                                       only for movable or portable appurtenances.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4635"></a>Perhaps thus a cottage with only two bedrooms may be able to dispense with
                                       any want of a maid's room and the responsibility of a household
                                       organization. At any rate, the office organization in Chicago in which both
                                       members of this household are involved is considered enough to absorb all
                                       available energy in that direction. And it is now becoming the conviction of
                                       many others that conservation of freedom must lead to the simplest house
                                       units and construction with retinues the smallest compatible with the size
                                       of the family, a standard simpler by far than prevalent types and perhaps
                                       approximating the completely tile-outfitted lunch rooms that serve the
                                       cleanest food with the least help and at the lowest price and the greatest
                                       profit.

                                       the soul. We are attracted by an ideal behind, the perception of which is,
                                       perhaps, subconscious but at any rate there, and our enjoyment is measured
                                       by the keenness of the perception. It is the case of the yellow primrose.

            <p><a name="d0e4756"></a>Say we call this aesthetic intuition or feeling, because it is independent of
                                       the intellect in the same way that we know ethical feeling, that of right
                                       and wrong, to be. A higher than mortal development may show a continuity in
                                       the fields of physical and meta-physical observation but for the present we
                                       must admit ignorance of the relationship and it is nothing less than
                                       presumption in the analytical art critic to content himself with picking
                                       flaws and extolling conformation to his own rules, unless his own
                                       preconceptions, through his absorption in these details, become as totally
                                       oblivious to the presence or absence of life as he is incapable of producing
                                       the beautiful himself.

                                       inspired and authority enacted. And so was his art then the highest

                                       cleverness, talent or ignorant striving for these. Hence for comparison of
                                       results the general conclusion has been that in houses practical
                                       considerations should govern, that house building, furniture building,

            <p><a name="d0e4978"></a>Mr. Griffin says:- "Louis Sullivan probably broke away from the old
                                       traditions when he left the Beaux Arts, if not before. He made his first
                                       declaration, presented his thesis, in 1884 when he read his "Inspiration"
                                       before an assembly of brother craftsmen. Since that time he has been the
                                       recognized leader in the effort of the best and brightest among the
                                       profession to "draw the thing as he sees it for the God of things as they
                                       are," though it was not until 1893 that a broad, illuminating and
                                       progressive conception of his art was forced upon the attention of the world
                                       by his Transportation Building with its polychromatic doorway at the
                                       Columbian Exposition.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e4981"></a>The public is at last realizing the logic of the principles for which Mr.
                                       Sullivan labored and which the best among those of lesser years and fresh
                                       enthusiasm have sought to develop. It does not mean that a discovery has
                                       been made and old principles in form and ethics turned topsy turvy. It does
                                       mean that a majority of those who believe that "form should follow function"
                                       and that "Progress should go before precedent" have good ground for so
                                       believing. The principle is being worked out by architects everywhere.
                                       Vitally active, and sanely pursued in the Middle West of the United States,
                                       it is also the inspiring motive on its Western border, and on the continent
                                       from Finland to Buda-Pest <a name="59"></a> [Note: i.e., Budapest]. It is the source of
                                       the most interesting architectural work.

            <p><a name="d0e4987"></a>Even among the conventional and the traditional its logic appeals and draws.
                                       It is the basis of thought as it will be of action of men whose talent and
                                       sane discrimination guide them in their professional work."

            <p><a name="d0e4990"></a>Mr. Griffin, Mr. Sullivan's successor in creative thinking, in these fields
                                       awakened the community to the necessity of considering simultaneously the
                                       problem of building and environment near and far. It now becomes clear that
                                       these cannot be practiced as separate professions, architect or town
                                       planner, but only as one indivisible profession - landscape architecture. It
                                       is time our Universities woke up to this fact and made one subject of these

            <p><a name="d0e5004"></a>There is an error which derives from our present day habit of being satisfied
                                       with rational thinking which starts from a premise and follows a straight
                                       line to a conclusion. This method of thinking leaves out all the
                                       multifarious facts that do not fall into that straight line. This method of
                                       thinking is or can be purely mechanical and is the idol of our time. More
                                       living thinking follows curves, sometimes very devious curves, for it takes
                                       note of facts and does not rest satisfied with theories. Facts lie outside
                                       of reason. The Gods do not use that method of thinking.

            <p><a name="d0e5007"></a>Creative thinking goes direct to totalities and works from wholes to
                                       particulars. The Greeks conceived the totality of nature - earth, water,
                                       air, fire, its four conditions of matter brought into existence by the
                                       formative forces revealed recently in the smashing of matter in the resorts
                                           <a name="60"></a> [Note: retorts?] revealing astounding forces. The Greeks expressed
                                       their inspiration in the fourness <a name="61"></a> [Note: i.e., four-ness] of their
                                       temples.

            <p><a name="d0e5016"></a>Every true revolutionary is a creative thinker, not a destroyer but a
                                       builder. Thus the French revolution was not a revolution but an upheaval
                                       substituting one control for another. The same is true of Bolshevism in
                                       Russia and so with most community upheavals. There was however in France
                                       someone who had a creative imagination when he cried out for liberty,
                                       equity, fraternity. But the vision faded. No one did anything about it. The
                                       concept of humanity as having three functions was never translated into
                                       deeds. So we continue to have totalitarian governments and continue to have
                                       upheavals in our communities but nowhere yet the revolution of transforming
                                       our communities from the totalitarianism form to a threefold form to meet
                                       these three needs of humanity. Yet it is axiomatic that if an entity has
                                       three functions to fulfill it must have three organs to fulfill them. This
                                       revolution calls for no upheaval, merely constructive deeds.

                                       unfortunate title for one lot is as important as a city) a simultaneous
                                       consideration of all the elements is requisite, is essential. In modern
                                       times, say since the 15th century, Griffin was the creative thinker in this
                                       field. As a boy in school he laid down the basic principles of occupation
                                       &amp; distribution. Shortly after graduation he laid down a town plan
                                       for a Chinese client <a name="62"></a> [Note: Wong Kai Kah (1860-1906)?] of a city
                                           <a name="63"></a> [Note: an addition to Shanghai?] to be built in China.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5033"></a>It was not long before the opportunity he had been waiting for presented
                                       itself - Australia was calling for designs for their Federal Capital city.
                                       He won the prize and was made Federal Director of Design &amp;
                                       Construction of Canberra. When after six years he resigned a law was passed
                                       that no deviation from the plan could be made except by an act of
                                       Parliament. Since a city is a thing that grows through the decades and
                                       centuries Griffin never expected to see more than a small part in actual
                                       execution but, since governments don't have to pay interest on the money
                                       they expend, Canberra is now one of the sights of the world the roads of a
                                       whole city and its suburbs laid out and constructed on the ground the whole
                                       of which can be seen from the neighboring heights, and the citizens are
                                       saying that through that great conception of Mr. Griffin's the soul of
                                       Australia is developing.

            <p><a name="d0e5074"></a>That land planning was the essence or Griffin's profession, even the land
                                       planning of a single lot, is illustrated in Volume III, The Federal Battle,
                                       where photographs of his community plans form the Initials for its 24
                                       chapters. The full flowering of his work came in the last year of his life
                                       which was spent in India with which country America should be closely bound
                                       through mutual (individual not imperial) interests. Each has much to gain
                                       from the other whereas Europe will doubtless have to stand apart for a long
                                       time to come.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5077"></a>We must realize that architecture and community planning are inseparable and
                                       that, for all the great genius of Sullivan, the school which grew from his
                                       inspiration died aborning so to speak until Griffin united community
                                       planning with it. The Chicago school died not only because of the cancer
                                       sore in it - one <a name="64"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright?] who originated very little
                                       but spent most of his time claiming everything and swiping everything even
                                       using an Australian <a name="65"></a> [Note: George A. Taylor?] who contacted him on a
                                       trip through America and thenceforth forwarded to him what he could get hold
                                       of of Griffin's work as for instance an imitation knitlock house in
                                       California and solid floor on the ground which immediately began to leak and
                                       had to be done all over again. The square tiles of the walls had no
                                       structural raison d'etre. Purely another case of "I want to be the lion
                                       too."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5086"></a>The development of individuals as well as of the arts, especially
                                       Architecture, depends on the structure of the community and so long as
                                       private ownership of land continues the community can have no structure. We
                                       can't even get a quarter section of Chicago to prove that through its
                                       treatment the community can become a healthy, happy organism with no child
                                       delinquency.

            <p><a name="d0e5097"></a>This was in 1913. Griffin was already in Australia when the working drawings
                                           <a name="66"></a> [Note: N-YHS handwritten addition: "of one of the dwellings - Own House .
                                           Trier Center -] were being made. I handed the plans to the
                                       engineer in our office, a fine engineer he was too, to work out the
                                       structural steel. He came to me presently saying scornfully that building
                                       couldn't be built, it had no stamina, couldn't take the horizontal stresses.
                                       You will notice that it has two pairs of heavy piers. The rest of the house
                                       is two bays, all windows, the glass house par excellence. The concrete piers
                                       terminate either end of the stair passages. I replied - "Do you mean to tell
                                       me those great heavy piers can't hold up that little house?" "But," he said,
                                       "there is no weight in the corners to take up the horizontal stresses." "But
                                       surely," said I, "it is possible by engineering means to take up such

                                       to his desk and tied the bays into the piers. This is an interesting
                                       instance of the basic difference between the engineer and the architect. The
                                       engineer thinks in terms of the past - "It isn't done." The architect thinks
                                       in terms of the future - "It has to be done."

                                       cost no more to build than an ordinary brick building. The structural units
                                       are larger than bricks making the erection economical - the Pyrmont

                                       co-operative treatment of the garden area we may feel assured that these
                                       possibilities will be developed to their utmost. No outbuildings are to be
                                       allowed outside restricted court garden limits indicated in the original
                                       plan. Hedges and wire fences will be the reliance for separating the private
                                       gardens so far as isolation is desired by any families. The low walls
                                       indicating the demarcation between private garden and public forecourts are
                                       part of the original construction and an important factor in unifying the

                                       evidenced by the procession of people who come to visit any such building in
                                       the course of its construction, individuals frequently returning week after
                                       week to watch its various stages of progress; and also by the warm affection
                                       and watchful care of occupants after completion. It seems also to be the
                                       fact that such a house built for sale can be disposed of with facility. The
                                       residences are sometimes sold long before completion, while still crude for

                                       picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and hedges with tree
                                       and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house that alone would be an
                                       unmitigated box into an appropriate link of a rambling, cozy, private
                                       community home of separated wings, bays and pavilions, such as might

                                       I saw worked out - in arrangement of four houses to a block the one
                                       arrangement by Frank Lloyd Wright leaving practically the whole of the yards
                                       to the street frontage, giving no privacy and necessitating long drives and
                                       walks for access to the houses. The disadvantage of such an arrangement was

                                       Columbia, when a friend stated that she could not be induced to build her

                                       in the center of the block. That there may be no loss but much gain in

                                       instead of the center of the blocks. You will see the advantage of looking
                                       at the problem not simply as an architect but as landscape architect. For

                                       for gardens and playgrounds. The temptation for men and children to cut
                                       across the corners of the lot is eliminated. By placing the service quarters
                                       next the street the desirable outlooks are reserved for the living rooms of
                                       the house, none of the private space being required for service quarters
                                       which are amply provided with light and air from the public streets. The
                                       living rooms thus look upon a private stretch unintersected by roadway, an
                                       effective park for use in common if so desired or, if subdivided by hedges,

                                       parklike character and offering opportunity for the play of the young people
                                       away from the danger and distractions of the street. Since both house and
                                       nature are three dimensional, the feeling of spaciousness is their prime
                                       requisite.

                                       found in that community which has fewest governmental restrictions.

            <p><a name="d0e5393"></a>If an architect is to solve a problem, he must be free to break away from
                                       established methods. Architects should therefore be responsible for their
                                       work and that responsibility should not be shifted.

                                       that an architect who attempts to do a model house is seriously hampered and
                                       usually totally prevented from carrying out such work, because the very fact
                                       that it is different means that it will not be passed by the authorities in
                                       control. This consequence is the very essence of the system of governmental
                                       restriction of building, since bodies politically constituted can lay down
                                       rules only by reference to and in accordance with what has been done and is
                                       the custom to do.

                                       atomic form frees the spiritual forces of matter. They are not things that
                                       can be weighed and measured except in terms of force. Thus do the Orient and
                                       the Occident meet.

            <p><a name="d0e5437"></a>The reason why America won the war and will win the peace is because the
                                       strength and power of the individual is recognized and given full play. The
                                       first step was to escape from the rest of the world - the Eastern world, the
                                       Asiatic continent of which Europe is but a state and to establish a
                                       community organization in which no individual nor group had <u>power</u> over another, a community whose basic principle is EQUITY.
                                       There are many lovely and wonderful people elsewhere in the world but they
                                       are helpless. Migration to America frees their spiritual forces. That is the
                                       magic of the United States. The founders of the Congressional System smashed
                                       the political atom which holds the rest of humanity in bondage.

                                       of the world - emigrate instead of immigrate the watchword - and break down
                                       the bondage of individuals everywhere. It is a difficult but not impossible
                                       task. It is the task of pathfinders. The following tale is the story of one

                                       blaze the way in this bitter battle against the Powers.

            <p><a name="d0e5480"></a>Buildings are the most subtle, accurate and enduring records of life - hence
                                       their problems are the problems of life and not problems of form;- but
                                       through the forms and material of buildings we can gain an insight into the
                                       life of the past. In many cases that is now our only approach and, where
                                       archeology and history have afforded a check, I like to believe that
                                       buildings convey the most truth of the mental and spiritual states of
                                       various peoples and times. In the aggregate the architecture of a people
                                       certainly represents the greatest amount of human effort applied to the
                                       realization of purely human ideals.

            <p><a name="d0e5486"></a>In our own times, of which we have of course the most complete history, the
                                       decadence, almost atrophy, of the art of architecture since the Middle Ages
                                       in Europe points to some analysis of life as necessary to the formulation of
                                       the problems of building. Roman history offers the only parallel to such
                                       loss of the creative instincts and the substitution of imitation and
                                       ostentation for sincerity and invention. Those times were sordid and
                                       prepared the doom of Western civilization. With similar failure in our
                                       architectural expression for over 400 years it may be worth our while to
                                       consider why our ideals are lacking constructive results in the one art that
                                       is based on common and general impulse.

            <p><a name="d0e5489"></a>The great significance of the architecture of our times is that it is not
                                       only for the man in the street but necessarily by and of the average man.
                                       Alone amongst the arts, Architecture denies to the genius of the man ahead
                                       of his time the very forms, colors, notes or words with which to express his
                                       ideals or to blaze a path for the masses. The masses must painfully grope
                                       out their own uncertain way. Even the artisan has little chance to put on
                                       the extra touch or express his feeling in his work because he is limited to
                                       the market

                                       the foundation for a freer life for succeeding generations. The scope for
                                       imagination is a hundred-fold greater than at any time in history. A squad
                                       of men with mechanical equipment can perform feats of construction in a year
                                       worthy of centuries with legions of workers before. If, as has been stated,
                                       our average man, woman and child now have at their disposal physical force
                                       equal to some twenty slaves then, as compared with former civilizations
                                       based on six serf power to one free man, our powers for self expression are
                                       in the aggregate six times or 120 times as great for destruction or

            <p><a name="d0e5529"></a>What a pity that the monument to this power, so far, exists in our cities all
                                       alike dirty, monotonous, disorderly and desolate, with their conscious
                                       pretensions and reiteration of the commonplace and the lifeless forms of
                                       antiquity. I hope and believe we are not satisfied with this as the final
                                       product of science. The great scientists themselves have about come to the
                                       end of their pursuit of matter, in the elusive electron most intelligibly
                                       characterized in a citation by Henri Poincare as the "Hole in the ether."
                                       Just as geographical discovery has now been thrown back onto archeology so,
                                       I anticipate, will the pioneering spirits that have evolved physical science
                                       turn back, perhaps by way of psychological experiments, to the great mental
                                       substratum of mankind which underlies the individual conscious intellect.

            <p><a name="d0e5532"></a>There is certainly sufficient evidence of the unconscious mind to satisfy the
                                       most inductive and empirical experimenter and, considering the completeness
                                       with which the whole of mankind has been converted by the pioneers of
                                       science in three centuries, a wider awakening to the disused powers of the

                                       not they realize that those restrictions are self-imposed on their natural
                                       activities. Satisfaction dependent on external stimuli, such as movies,
                                       jazz, speedways and acrobatics, is bound to be short lived; these betray a
                                       craving for emotional satisfaction which can never be attained except
                                       through feelings in sympathy with rather than opposed to practical needs and
                                       experience.

            <p><a name="d0e5557"></a>Such satisfaction can be found through social consciousness on the one hand
                                       and aesthetic appreciation on the other. The present hectic state can only
                                       bring about quick exhaustion but it contains a certain spontaneity and so
                                       much less hypocrisy than the intellectual, puritanical pretension of only a
                                       few years back that it may betoken the turning point from a purely
                                       intellectual outlook and timid repression back to a broader psychological
                                       and emotional contact with life. After passive simian curiosity has been
                                       satisfied in the pioneers of thought, and after economic strain on the
                                       underlying humanity has been eased by the expedients of practical followers
                                       of science then, when the physical senses have become calloused to
                                       excitement, more and more men will be turning their attention inward to the
                                       possibilities of co-operation between the head and the heart in social
                                       service and creative effort.

                                       develop an organic communal life, have been inconsistent or fundamentally in
                                       conflict with an enduring civilization. We have come to recognize an
                                       external natural order of things which we see, hear, touch, smell and taste
                                       and consider real, but such a world of isolated, individual intellect
                                       supplies no place for instinctive ideals or desires such as justice or
                                       beauty; and if the supernatural or divine world once conceived by us to
                                       support those ideals

                                       simple factors has left such unsolved equations in fundamental human

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5851"></a>It is but natural for each of us to rank high in importance the particular
                                       field of work on which he happens to be employed. It is also right, and
                                       necessary to his self-respect, to make it possible that all the multifarious
                                       duties in the world be discharged. In the measure that a man speaks
                                       truthfully he conveys his own perspective of the universe with the things in
                                       his foreground looming largest.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e5854"></a>However, as already pointed out, architecture is an inescapable expression
                                       and revelation of and to all mankind, and one's relation to it is an index
                                       of his individuality. It is therefore really important to the fundamental
                                       self-respect of everyone of us to study life from the perspective point of
                                       the architect. In the future as sure as fate our purposes, our strength, our
                                       insincerities, our foibles will be an open book in the remains or ruins of
                                       our buildings. The record is not only qualitative but quantitative as the
                                       last resultant of all our physical powers.

            <p><a name="d0e5857"></a>Up to the present day - to attempt to discuss this subject without
                                       illustrations would be a waste of time but we all witness now so many miles
                                       of pictures weekly that it is unnecessary to portray the fact - the monotony
                                       of the modern environment is not merely here but everywhere. The isolated
                                       relics of earlier art as well as the unique variations in races of men and
                                       genera of plants and animals are being obliterated in the ubiquitous
                                       standardized product of our building art. It is significant that not until
                                       the modern intellectual age of renaissance did we hear much of anything
                                       about architects, and it is not to the architects that we go to learn
                                       architecture now, even in the schools where the cult is taught, but
                                       ultimately to the unidentified origin back in the naive, subconscious
                                       creative periods when art was not in conflict with the surrounding natural
                                       world nor a reflex of internal strife.

                                       was lifted up out of the ground. I myself realized later that Wright was
                                       quick on the uptake. The <a name="86"></a> [Note: Isidore] Heller house which was on the

                                       old colonial plan. In a bit of free time I designed a house for my family in
                                       Hubbard Woods where we children had grown up. It was a long narrow oblong
                                       with an octagonal room flanking on either side near the front. The next
                                       Wright house was that plan - the <a name="88"></a> [Note: Joseph and Helen] Husser House
                                       - but two squares instead of the octagons. I thought nothing of that till
                                       years later Wright began his publications claiming all the young Chicago
                                       Architects as his disciples, which was far from the truth. I would grant
                                       that what one likes one can use - as on the growth of Gothic - but cannot
                                       claim.

            <p><a name="d0e5933"></a>The definite idea of architecture to my mind lies in the organic, systematic
                                       way of creation that nature shows in fitting an infinite variety of means to
                                       as many ends with perfection of form for every function - to recall Louis
                                       Sullivan's alliteration:- "Form follows Function."

                                       that it was in the beginning of civilization when everywhere in every race
                                       and every climate <u>anonymous</u> architects expressed fitness

                                       for the architect than in the wooded rock ledges of the headlands of Sydney
                                       Harbor - a nice problem, for the factors are definitely clear-cut and simple
                                       socially, economically and aesthetically:- a million people free to exercise
                                       their own judgment, economically able to provide themselves with fully
                                       equipped and appointed substantial homes with a beautiful, easily worked
                                       stone and underlying their sites and all other building materials
                                       indigenous, and all skill and equipment, handy, and the most, beautiful

            <p><a name="d0e5945"></a>The aesthetic requirements are modesty to the extent of subordination of
                                       structural features to the striking characteristics of the forested cliffs,
                                       using the stone and level coursing uniform with them that will accomplish
                                       this, and a diminutive scale of one story that can accord with the
                                       diminutiveness of natural forms without breaking with the established habits
                                       and accepted type plans. After a hundred years during which every
                                       alternative has been introduced from every corner of the earth this natural
                                       formula is now being tried out at Castlecrag in Sydney Harbor.

            <p><a name="d0e6214"></a>The first vivid picture of a personality inflexible, indomitable, is a baby
                                       boy following his mother about the garden patting the flowers as he went.
                                       All his life it hurt him to have flowers picked, hurt him as it does others
                                       to see a bird's wing broken, an absorbing love that enabled him to recognize
                                       new flowers in the field that he had read about in encyclopedias years
                                       before, the absorbing interest that develops the absolute memory. This
                                       memory in later years enabled him, in a new country with a different
                                       monetary system and utterly different prices of materials (after one day and
                                       night spent with a contractor going over prices of all building materials),
                                       to go on the witness stand quite ready to answer any questions with definite
                                       statements as to current prices.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6217"></a>As a little boy in school, teased and bullied by bigger boys, he decided that
                                       if he cried when they hurt him it would amuse them to keep up their torments
                                       so he never cried no matter what they did. They soon quit bothering him. In
                                       manhood no one could disturb his equanimity. I have seen him go through
                                       torments that have driven other men into rages of fury with blood-shot eyes,
                                       that have thrown them quite off their balance; but they never got under his
                                       skin, they never disturbed the sweetness of his disposition, they were never
                                       to wear him out as he could have been worn if he had allowed his emotions to
                                       be roused.

                                       doubtless intended for his father. It was one of Henry George's. He read it
                                       and decided on the first book he would draw from the library. A year later,
                                       for in those days children couldn't draw books till they were twelve, he
                                       drew out George's Social Science. The problems of humanity then became his
                                       problems and with the thorough grounding of one of the masters of Economics
                                       he looked at life with the clear eyes of one building on firm foundations,
                                       distinguishing between man-made and God-made things. Possibly this early

                                       conventional and timid parents forbad swimming. A child's instinctive

                                       and revolutionary effect on the work of the office of Frank Lloyd Wright
                                       with whom he entered into partnership in the early days of that office, as
                                       illustrated by the dwelling of Mr. Little in Oak Park and the Larkin

            <p><a name="d0e6290"></a>Today we are being told that we should determine our aim in life and,
                                       satisfied that it is what we will to have and bending our whole being to it,
                                       nothing in creation can prevent our attaining our end. Evidently holding
                                       that simple faith, though in those early days with no conscious analysis of
                                       it, at 20 years of age a sturdy young man went to his state University and
                                       demanded a course in Town Planning. No University in the world gave such a
                                       course. But pioneer days were not a thing of the long past in Illinois and
                                       there were still stalwarts, and the spirit of adventure remained in the
                                       spirit of the old as well as in the blood of the young. They told him that
                                       if he found six others who would take such a course they would create it for
                                       him. He found three others and the course of Town Planning was established
                                       in the University of Illinois at Champaign to be followed in the next
                                       quarter of a century - after the Australian Federal Capital adventure - by
                                       the establishment of courses in Town Planning in many Universities in many
                                       countries. Unfortunately the field is still largely controlled by land
                                       speculators.

                                       manner. Let me describe one of the banquets. Daniel Webster was reported on

                                       Hall must be decorated. One of the residents was an East Indian sea captain.
                                       He had silks and tapestries that he kindly lent and the ladies used them in
                                       decorating. All that had cut glass or silver lent it. At one end of the

                                       passengers for carrying them through a terrible storm safely, and at the
                                       other end another set of the same kind - tray, teapot, sugar bowl, etc. The
                                       ladies saw to it that the tables were loaded with tempting food and they
                                       were dressed in silks and satins that they had brought to the wilderness in
                                       their chests.

                                       he became captain. He was unlettered but a born poet. It was a great treat
                                       when his family received letters from him to hear them. Often there would be
                                       pages in rhyme. At the banquet when he went to welcome Webster with his
                                       little wife on his arm - he was a big man - his words were something of this
                                       description. "I have been around the world several times, I have bowed
                                       before kings and queens on their thrones, but never with the heart thrill
                                       that Love felt in shaking the hand of our illustrious Daniel Webster."
                                       Webster was one of my Mother's <a name="112"></a> [Note: MMG's grandmother's] heroes.
                                       Father <a name="113"></a> [Note: MMG's grandfather] hurt her keenly once. When she had
                                       been extolling him father said - "but he never paid your father the hundred
                                       he owed him." Father had to humbly beg her pardon.

            <p><a name="d0e6402"></a>One summer father sent her East to visit old friends and relatives and while
                                       visiting at Mr. Webster's his niece said wouldn't you like a lock of Uncle
                                       Daniel's hair? He was writing at his desk when his niece went back of him
                                       and cut quite a generous lock. While that was happening as he probably had
                                       heard what she had said he wrote mother a little note sending his regards to
                                       grandfather, etc. On coming home mother found so many wanted "just a few
                                       hairs" that she would have no lock left so with the note she had it framed
                                       and gave it to her eldest grandson, Dwight H. Perkins. (That and one from
                                       Lincoln are still treasured by the family. Another from Lincoln was stolen
                                       from the walls of grandson Leslie's living room.)

            <p><a name="d0e6405"></a>Mr. Lincoln was a frequent visitor at our house and my mother he admired and
                                       honored. When he was made president he remembered his friends of old
                                       Tremont. Mr. <a name="114"></a> [Note: David] Davis of Bloomington who was a frequent
                                       guest at Tremont he made a judge of the Supreme Bench <a name="115"></a> [Note: Court].
                                       John Albert Jones, who used to walk five or ten miles before breakfast and
                                       drank from ten to fifteen cups of tea at the parties, he made judge of the
                                       Court of Claims, my father, Brigade Surgeon in the Civil War.

            <p><a name="d0e6419"></a>As these pages are written just for my own family I think here is a good
                                       place to speak of father. The beautiful picture of Dr. MacLure in Bonny
                                       Brier Bush stories has been thought of by some as an impossibility in fact.
                                       The author was asked to answer the question. He said - "It has been my good
                                       fortune to know your country doctors, not one of them without faults but who
                                       each one of them might have sat for my hero."

            <p><a name="d0e6422"></a>Father from a little boy seemed cut out for a doctor. He was born in
                                       Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and Mother in Sanbornton. Grandfather Lovejoy was
                                       its richest man, had his 25 wagons plodding the roads to Boston and lived in
                                       the finest mansion in Sanbornton. He failed, went to Toronto when father and
                                       mother were married and from there joined the colony that went West to
                                       Illinois. Grandfather put what was left of his fortune into a beautiful farm
                                       on Rock River. Father is happily described by Mrs. <a name="116"></a> [Note: Eliza W.]
                                       Farnham, one of the early woman suffragists and friend of Lucy Stone and
                                       Susan B. Anthony, who in her book called "Life in Prairie Land," said he was
                                       another Dr. MacLure. I loved my father dearly and never dreamed anyone could
                                       speak of him disrespectfully so I was indignant when a mother, after hours
                                       of agony, was reported as saying - "Some say mean things of you but no one
                                       could equal you when a woman is in travail."

            <p><a name="d0e6428"></a>He often traveled sixty or seventy miles to see a patient and in those days
                                       they had no nurses and often no woman to help and father would be gone for
                                       days and days. For many years he was the only doctor so he attended the
                                       birth of most of the little ones. In all his thirty and more years he never
                                       lost a mother or a child. A physician told him that was a most remarkable
                                       record, that he should have kept a record. He never kept any kind of books
                                       and when he did send in a bill being obliged to pay his own bills, often he
                                       would get one back equaling his for vegetables they had put in the back of
                                       his buggy, which he never asked for and took for granted were presents,
                                       especially as he had one

            <p><a name="d0e6442"></a>He was the life of every gathering and the amusement of the young folks when
                                       he danced as he kept perfect time and danced on his toes. His horse he
                                       always petted and would talk to it. If he fell asleep the horse would always
                                       stop when it came to the gate of a place where somebody had been sick,
                                       father would open his eyes, look and say - "Nobody sick here now Pomp, go
                                       along," and the horse would move on. I used to love to drive over the
                                       country with him, and sometimes he would say - "Daughter we shall probably
                                       take dinner here and they will possibly have a simple meal, just bacon
                                       swimming in fat and boiled potatoes, but eat as though you enjoyed it." Our
                                       home was very pretty, built on the top of a hill opposite the square where
                                       the red brick courthouse stood. It had circular walks, latticed porches,
                                       pretty garden - and now not a vestige of its former self left except the
                                       great hard maple trees that father planted when he built. The old court
                                       house that should have been converted into a Hall or Library was torn down.

            <p><a name="d0e6445"></a>The little town of Tremont had its churches and schools. Generally one
                                       resident minister but the pulpits were often filled by the ministers of
                                       different cities. Of course the Episcopal Church had to be visited whenever
                                       it had members that wished confirmation. I will speak of two I knew. Bishop
                                       Chase the founder of Jubilee College in or near Bloomington used to come and
                                       confirm and to christen. (My brother Leslie graduated from there.) He was
                                       gifted but an arbitrary old soul. Once I heard mother say that when he read
                                       in the service, "I am the Lord of Hosts," you always felt that was what he
                                       considered himself. Bishop Whitehouse was a highly educated polished scholar
                                       who, I always felt, must have had a touch of the snob in him or his children
                                       would not have been such snobs, but they may have inherited from someone
                                       further back. One of has sons came one day into old Dr. Davis' office for
                                       attention. The doctor was one of our ablest physicians but a very blunt man
                                       and some temper. This day his office, as usual during office hours, was

                                       me a chance to express my gratitude. He left Tremont in its early days and
                                       settled in Chicago. Successful in business he had a lovely home. Many
                                       remember his grandson, Louis James, who quite distinguished himself on the
                                       stage. Col. James' handsome daughter Elizabeth married Thompson Flint who
                                       came to Chicago and made his millions in grain here. His wife and mother
                                       were always closest friends.

                                       you would not recognize. Of course there are splendid farms about the town,

                                       home a large white mansion in the center of noble trees was noted for its
                                       hospitality and refinement. His son, Lawrence Wybray married my beautiful
                                       Aunt Sophia and they and the family lived there with the Captain and his
                                       dear little wife - a home where all the scattered family could congregate.
                                       Two of his sons settled in New Orleans, his lovely daughter Georgine married

                                       assigned to one of Chicago's public schools. Every weekend I was made
                                       welcome in their lovely home. I remember one Monday morning a fierce storm
                                       was raging but I dressed and started out to get a car on State Street.
                                       Standing in the middle of the tracks he stood all muffled up directing the

                                       of anyone I ever know. She would have made a good Secretary of State. Her

                                       two boys. Of course it was very difficult to get help though father as he
                                       went all over the country had better chances than most. But he helped
                                       mightily when work piled too high. Sunday was our heaviest day. Father came
                                       in laughing one morning and told us about a little red headed boy calling to
                                       him over the hedge, - "Say Doctor do you like Sundays?" and father to please
                                       him said, "No." "Nor I nuther," said the boy, "and I don't see why the Lord

                                       cook. "I would drive fifteen miles to get a piece of your lemon pie," we

                                       his home and say, "Mary a strong drop of tea please," which Mother would
                                       quickly make ready in one of his pretty little tea pots. My brother Leslie
                                       had a blooded pup which was the pride of his life. Also it was a winter of
                                       bitter cold. I shall never forget the morning I was called by my father to
                                       hurry down stairs if I wanted to see my little sister. He declared I didn't

                                       had just read in Leslie's journal - "This has been the darndest week for

                                       self, that attracted the young people but that annoyed father so he wrote in
                                       big letters "Short calls make long friends" and hung it on the mantle. First
                                       night two young gents came in and at just midnight they jumped and blew out
                                       the lights and rushed out. There was much good cheer and good feeling but
                                       much work, but no one of us ever heard our mother speak angrily or even
                                       impatiently, and we were no models. She hadn't father's sense of humor,
                                       still she amused us at times describing some caller. I remember a lank
                                       washed out young girl sitting by the stove waiting for father to put up a
                                       prescription and mother, who was all politeness asked after her father.
                                       "Father is dead, he died of fever." "And your mother?" "Oh she is dead too.

                                       home suits. When they returned the next day where their log house had been
                                       was a pile of ashes. Father had a fine medical library

                                       left. The town people thought an old codger who used to tramp about the

                                       father had in his study. Dear old Quaker Wilson took Mother in and treated
                                       her so lovingly, and father was always cheerful and knew that, with

                                       memorable times. The little town grew but since the Civil war but few are
                                       left that have any legends to tell of the early days. One left and went to

                                       and their loving care and tenderness could never be forgotten. All the
                                       able-bodied men went to work to build a log cabin and the ladies to sewing
                                       articles for the doctor's wife Mary. Soon Hamlet, one of father's brothers,
                                       came with his bride who though called plain would outshine any young beauty
                                       by her grace, intelligence and charm of manner. Aunt Margaret in her
                                       happiness saw everything in a rosy light. She wrote to her husband's
                                       brother, Judge Hamilton Perkins of Concord, New Hampshire, of her romantic
                                       life on the Prairie describing herself as reclining on a couch with crimson
                                       covering, and other matters in the same glowing colors which caused Uncle
                                       Hamilton to say when he later on received a letter from Mother - "Now we
                                       shall get facts as here is a letter from Mary." I dare say he learned the
                                       truth about things but it would be cheerful, full of hope but facts. He
                                       would be able to picture the couch as boards on boxes and covered with
                                       turkey red.

            <p><a name="d0e6599"></a>Men used to say that neither horse nor water would ever be the cause of
                                       Hamilton Perkins' death he was such a superb rider and swimmer. Little they
                                       knew. Uncle Hamilton went into the lumber business up by the Falls of St.
                                       Anthony. His house was built on a high place overlooking the falls. The
                                       winter had been severe and in order to prevent serious trouble the ice had
                                       to be broken. None of the men would risk it so Uncle went to work and soon
                                       the great piece he was working on moved and as he stood erect with his arms
                                       folded across his chest it quickly moved on by his home from the windows of
                                       which his wife and three children saw him carried over the falls.

            <p><a name="d0e6602"></a>Years later our Quaker friends, the Wilsons were murdered in their Winnetka
                                       home, and as far as I know the murderer is still living unmolested and
                                       undisturbed. Mrs. Sawyer, another Tremont character, believed in feeding
                                       people so all her life she rose at two or three o'clock and cooked so she
                                       could have pies, cakes, meat and hot bread for breakfast. Her son and a
                                       young girl she raised used to scrap in the yard and she would raise the
                                       window and exclaim, "Abail Buss and Sara Ann ain't ye ashamed of
                                       yourselves!"

            <p><a name="d0e6605"></a>The Platt family had a large family of girls all very intelligent but of
                                       delicate health. The two eldest were addicted to walking in their sleep.
                                       Julia would rise, go out, do all her chores and commence getting breakfast
                                       when Uncle Nathan who married the eldest sister would hear her and awaken
                                       her. The traveling ministers and lecturers often stayed with us while they
                                       remained and one night Rev. L. read us a sonnet of <a name="125"></a> [Note: John]
                                       Milton's. Not long after Angeline had gone to her bed her mother called to
                                       father and said, "Augustus, Angeline is sitting up in bed and talking a
                                       steady stream. Father when he reached her said, "She is talking in her sleep
                                       and is repeating verbatim Milton's sonnet that Mr. L. read. She had never
                                       read it nor heard it before and could not repeat any of it when awakened.

                                       but most started in log cabins. Whenever an adjoining town had a dance or a
                                       good time all the neighboring towns would endeavor to send representatives.
                                       Bloomington, Pekin and Peoria were busy towns. Bloomington reported it was
                                       to have a dance so many of the villagers planned to go and among them father
                                       and mother. Mother was called Queen of the West and when she was arrayed in

                                       figure she looked it every inch.

            <p><a name="d0e6676"></a>I had an interesting experience. I stood in a doorway in the bright sun, my
                                       shadow sharply cast on my light carpet as was also the jamb of the doorway.
                                       Presently my attention was arrested by a surprising thing that happened
                                       every time the shadow of my arm came near to the shadow of the door jamb. A
                                       big lump almost the size of my fist swelled up on my arm's shadow and
                                       reached out till it joined the jamb's shadow. On closer inspection I saw
                                       that there was also a smaller lump reaching out from the larger shadow
                                       toward that of my arm. I have in only one case found a material scientist
                                       who would give any serious attention to this fact or who would offer an
                                       explanation of it though all of them are familiar with the fact of osmosis
                                       where one liquid is drawn toward another. Too interested in their theory to
                                       pay any attention to facts. In astronomical observations of the transit of
                                       Venus the scientists have made the same observations but brushed them aside
                                       hoping for better luck next time. It was again a case of darkness attracting
                                       darkness - darkness the beginning of matter, the creator of liquidity,
                                       exhibits the phenomenon of attraction. For a fascinating exposition of this
                                       phenomenon I refer you to the 6th lecture of Dr. Rudolf Steiner's series on
                                       light.

            <p><a name="d0e6692"></a>First of all it is necessary to understand that all superficial
                                       characteristics should be the natural consequence of underlying structural
                                       requirements. Honesty is quite as basic a necessity in architecture as in
                                       other fields of life. We find here as everywhere that spiritual qualities
                                       precede material expression and real and permanent beauties can result only
                                       on such a foundation. Thus, to attain beautiful results in architecture
                                       there must be no superficial requirements but purely rational ones and the
                                       whole effort of the architect must be bent toward the accomplishment of
                                       three things:- An absolute solution of the problem resulting from due
                                       consideration of all the elements which have any bearing on it; an honest
                                       use of materials in accordance with their nature, and perfection of form.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6695"></a>The first of these, a solution of the problem, we have been discussing in the
                                       previous lessons. The second point is the honest use of materials.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e6698"></a>There is no necessity nor is it tolerable that any material used in a
                                       structure should be made in imitation of any other material. Sham, wherever

                                       find in undemocratic communities which classify human beings on purely
                                       superficial qualifications. All materials in nature are beautiful, and
                                       structures will be beautiful if materials are used frankly and treated
                                       according to their natural characteristics, and we find, in fact, an
                                       infinite variety of perfect structures where it is as impossible to say that
                                       one is more beautiful than another as it is to say that one landscape is
                                       more beautiful than another, and these structures may be of any material,
                                       whether it be the unbaked mud of Adobe structures of some of the Indian
                                       peoples or whether they be of bamboo or stone. The ugliness arises only when
                                       we try to twist one material into imitation of another as of wood cut or
                                       painted to represent bricks or concrete shaped to imitate stone or any of
                                       the other innumerable subterfuges so commonly made use of

            <p><a name="d0e6774"></a>We find the natural building materials most generally used for the shelter of
                                       human beings have been stone and wood, but to those from very early times
                                       have been added artificial materials, brick, tile and concrete. These are
                                       quite distinct in their characteristics and nothing but disadvantage arises
                                       from the attempt to make them imitate stone. These artificial materials
                                       contrast sharply in their characteristics, the brick and tile because of the
                                       burning necessary in their manufacture must be in small pieces usually much
                                       smaller than stone as ordinarily obtained from the quarries. Concrete, on
                                       the other hand, has no such restriction and lends itself to massive
                                       structure with large unbroken surfaces. When so used it becomes very
                                       impressive and quite as beautiful as any other material. In fact, the
                                       possibilities in the use of concrete have barely been touched for there is
                                       no limitation of the materials with which it can be made so that its surface
                                       effects can vary from the greyish tones of the cement itself to any of the
                                       colors of the material with which the cement is mixed, which may be anything
                                       from sand to sparkling quartz or exquisite

                                       the last decade or two in the United States have developed bricks whose
                                       surfaces vary from smooth polished to soft rich surfaces obtained by cutting
                                       the bricks with wire and of great range of color from lovely greys through

                                       discarded altogether as far richer effects can be obtained at less cost by
                                       omitting the third hard smooth coat of plaster and making the 2nd coat of
                                       sufficiently coarse material to give an interesting texture to the wall.
                                       Without any further treatment, if properly done, this gives very lovely grey
                                       tone. On this surface any color scheme desired can be obtained by the use of
                                       transparent stains. We can obtain a glowing or velvety tone with a depth and

                                       modern tools, the machines, we can get broad surfaces showing to full
                                       advantage the lovely texture, color and graining of an infinite variety of
                                       woods.

            <p><a name="d0e6831"></a>To bring out to perfection, we should not use complicated forms or thick
                                       coating materials such as paint. The finish that is given wood should be
                                       only such as is required to preserve it and keep it clean. When used for
                                       external work, since it is impossible under the circumstances of the weather
                                       to keep highly finished surfaces, the most satisfactory method is to use the
                                       wood rough as it comes from the saw instead of the paint dressed surfaces so
                                       common at present which have to be painted. These rough surfaces can be
                                       simply stained by materials which will penetrate enough to act as
                                       preservative of the wood yet do not conceal the character of the wood
                                       itself. Such stains can be the tones of the wood itself deepened only enough
                                       to prevent unpleasant results which might arise from the soiling of very
                                       light colored woods. So treated wood members used in the trimming of a house
                                       as for window frames and sashes and eaves and barge boards are far richer in
                                       their effect than any less frank use of the material can possibly be. In the
                                       interior, protected as it is from the weather, wood can be used for certain
                                       members where it may be desirable to use an easily worked material or where
                                       lightness is necessary as in the trim about windows and doors, for doors
                                       themselves and for furniture whether built in or movable, the most charming
                                       effect being gained by the use of the same wood and same finish throughout
                                       the house or at least throughout a suite of rooms as the living rooms or the
                                       bed rooms, and the most beautiful effects will be obtained not by the high
                                       hard polishes but by the most transparent stains, just sufficient to
                                       emphasize the natural grained wood, rubbed down with just enough wax to keep
                                       dirt from penetrating the wood. This method gives a soft surface scarcely
                                       distinguishable from the unfinished wood itself.

            <p><a name="d0e6852"></a>The determination of what materials shall be used in any structure is settled
                                       by several facts, all of which will be affected by the location of the
                                       building, for the expense of any one of these materials is largely
                                       determined by the locality which in one case may mean that wood is more
                                       expensive than any other material as is almost the case in Australia at the
                                       present time or may mean that stone will be less expensive than brick. Quite
                                       aside from the matter of expenditure it is usually desirable that local
                                       materials should be used as most harmonious results, especially for the
                                       community, will naturally arise from this method and whatever material is
                                       used should be considered for both exterior and interior purposes as the
                                       simplicity and harmony and quality of a building is largely determined by
                                       the use of the same material wherever appropriate both outside and inside.
                                       No other one thing will go so far toward giving a feeling of finish and
                                       unity to a building as this.

            <p><a name="d0e6858"></a>For a long time the staining of glass appeared to be a lost art as the colors
                                       obtained by modern processes were raw and garish. We have found, however,
                                       that this resulted from what has been termed too great perfection in its
                                       manufacture, since the richness can now be obtained by the introduction of

                                       vital importance and the subdivision of the glass in windows and doors often
                                       goes a long way towards giving a home that feeling of domesticity which is
                                       necessary if it is to meet its requirements. These points will affect and

                                       expense to get charming effects for glass, though difficult to cut in curved
                                       forms, is easily broken in straight lines. We should not, therefore, make
                                       attempts to paint pictures with colored glass but should use geometric
                                       motives or purely decorative forms.

            <p><a name="d0e6885"></a>We come finally to the extreme surfacing material which is color itself
                                       which, if it is to be used in such a way as not to obscure the qualities of
                                       the surfaces on which it is used, should be applied not in the form of thick
                                       paints but in pure transparent stains. These may be water mixtures or oil
                                       mixtures, but should not be mixed with the dense materials such as whiting
                                       which is almost universally used by our present decorators.

            <p><a name="d0e6888"></a>As to color itself, not even this should be looked upon as a matter of
                                       personal taste and whim. The proper colors to use in interior decoration is
                                       quite as such a matter of mathematics as is sound and form. In decorating
                                       the interiors of our homes we should recognize that both eye and mind and
                                       spirit have definite requirements which will be met only if we conform to
                                       the natural laws of color. Human beings are not creatures made to burrow in
                                       the dark but light is necessary, both for health and happiness, and this
                                       should guide our use of colors in the interior in order that our homes may
                                       approximate outdoors in the meeting of these requirements as closely as
                                       possible. In other words we want to bring light into our homes.

            <p><a name="d0e6891"></a>A glance at the spectrum will show us that the most luminous part of it is
                                       not to be found on either end but in the center. Out of darkness we come
                                       gradually into intense light and on again into darkness. The blue, violet
                                       and indigo rays tend toward obscurity as well as the deep red end of the
                                       spectrum and although with direct light such as we get from the sun itself
                                       there is still a certain luminosity in these terminal colors of the spectrum
                                       yet we will find that from reflected surfaces we can get a feeling of

                                       use in interiors and we find that wherever they are used there has been an
                                       attempt to overcome this fact by using them mixed with white which results
                                       in pasty, sickly tints which should never be used at all in decoration.
                                       Neither is it possible to get that feeling of luminosity by one color only.
                                       Experiments in decoration of high ceilings have been made which show that an
                                       effect of brilliant white can be obtained by painting a ceiling in narrow
                                       strips of a succession of colors constantly repeated, and we know that in
                                       light itself a union of all the colors of the spectrum result in white. Our
                                       rooms should therefore be arranged to make the use of 2 or more colors in a
                                       room. In fact, a color scheme can hardly be called a scheme unless it
                                       contains 3 tones just as 3 tones are required to form a chord in music. To
                                       show the difficulty in the use of words in describing colors I need only say
                                       that it sounds as if we were very limited in our choice of colors when we
                                       can use only the yellow or its mergings into the red through the orange on
                                       the one side and into the greens which are its combination with the blue on
                                       the other side but, in fact, the tones so composed are infinite in their
                                       variety though they can generally be classified under the one term, russet.
                                       It sounds very crude and ugly if we say a room is to be decorated in red,
                                       yellow and green; but a mere change of names to russet, gold and olive is
                                       sufficient to make one realize that such a combination may be very
                                       beautiful.

            <p><a name="d0e7106"></a>In designing this house advantage was taken of the natural topography. A good
                                       many residences in that part of Grand Rapids are located on top of a high
                                       embankment which rises up from a number of the streets. The Amberg house
                                       being located on the corner lot and with such an embankment gave the
                                       opportunity to build practically a one story house as viewed from the street
                                       leaving the driveway to go under the house on the street level. The total
                                       height from the sidewalk level to the highest floor is one story. By varying
                                       the height of the floors between the living room and the rest of the house
                                       we get added height in the large living room which makes it possible to get
                                       a very attractive scheme of ceiling lighting.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7109"></a>The main entrance from both sidewalk and driveway comes directly under the
                                       dining room. Two-thirds of a flight of stairs brings one to the level of the
                                       living room, morning room, living porch and hallway, giving access to the
                                       small outdoor flight of steps to the garden located in the inner angle of
                                       the lot, making it unnecessary to cross the driveway in order to reach this
                                       sunken garden. Five steps above the living room level are the dining room,
                                       service pantry and kitchen. This leaves the space below the service quarters
                                       entirely out of the ground so that the servants' bedrooms could be provided
                                       with full windows which would take away any feeling of being in basement
                                       rooms. It also leaves the servants' quarters in an "L" by themselves with
                                       direct entrance from the driveway.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7112"></a>By raising the floor of the bedrooms to the same height as that of the dining
                                       room the feeling of seclusion to the sleeping quarters is obtained and the
                                       window sills are lifted so high above the level of the lot at the top of the
                                       terrace that no one can look directly into the rooms even from that level.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7115"></a>The placing of the main bedroom at the end of the lot gives it the beautiful
                                       outlook to the south over the sunken garden. By carrying the

                                       democratic of human beings, a mother who never dreamed of dictating to her
                                       children and a rambunctious five they were. I quote from a New Year's
                                       greeting she sent to her friends:- "A word to that faithful company of
                                       co-workers who made my life one continual delight. (her teachers) Their high
                                       ideals, their unvarying steadfastness to duty, caused one of our head
                                       supervisors to say, 'this institution could be left without a head for a
                                       year and yet maintain its standard.' I always knew I was simply a good
                                       organizer and an appreciative onlooker of the superb good work you did. And
                                       reference should be made here to our able and efficient engineer who told
                                       one of the force that he had 'been with us seventeen years and had never had
                                       a disagreeable word spoken to him.' Ever ready to do and to watch after all
                                       the physical comforts, we were able to maintain an "even temper" as long as
                                       the air was fresh and the temperature even. Good-bye to the Christmas

                                       etc., though so shy of human beings even when well along in her teens that
                                       she would walk around the block to avoid greeting an acquaintance seen
                                       approaching in the distance. Then Aunt Myra - her great pal during all the
                                       years of this saint's life &#8212; took her home to Tremont for a year with the
                                       maternal grand-parents, the stately grandmother carrying on the household
                                       duties, the grandfather, who had never lost a baby, lying on his deathbed
                                       though the nine year old child was entirely unconscious of this fact.

            <p><a name="d0e7243"></a>There while Aunt Myra went to the surrounding districts on her horse Lucy,
                                       and to the neighboring towns giving piano lessons, the wee girl went to
                                       school and managed so to ingratiate herself to her teacher that they became
                                       lifelong correspondents in spite of the fact that she told a lie to her when
                                       asked if she was chewing gum. Miss Fenner instead of reproving her
                                       reprimanded the other pupils for leading this little girl to this act. I
                                       never forgot it (though I can't to this day see how she managed to make out
                                       a case against them) but in later years appreciated her pedagogical talent.
                                       I had the habit that year of telling lies - when Aunt Myra asked me if I had
                                       brushed my teeth or Grandma asked if I had been sliding in the ice - wearing
                                       out my shoes and so forbidden.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7246"></a>Many years after when I spoke to Aunt Myra about it as contrasted with my
                                       truthful disposition, she said, "Yes why did you do it?" My present
                                       philosophical analysis is that I was quite consciously rebellious of this to
                                       my mind quite unwarranted assumption of authority on their part, especially
                                       in things that Mother would never have dreamed of opposing - but mostly just
                                       a general stand against authority.

            <p><a name="d0e7254"></a>These instances stand out so vividly that, together with my estimation of my
                                       own character, I am inclined to consider them very important from a
                                       pedagogical point of view. I've helped many a mother to realize that it is
                                       folly to expect morals in young children and bad pedagogy to emphasize them.

            <p><a name="d0e7257"></a>With grandfather gone I was no longer of importance in grandmother's home, to
                                       run errands in emergencies since Aunty's work took her far afield (though I
                                       was never conscious of my usefulness while I was there. I think now it would
                                       have been wholesome for me to have known. Children appreciate and respond to
                                       a consciousness of responsibility.) So I returned home again where the only
                                       outdoor playground was the streets except for a pocket handkerchief back
                                       yard where many circus tricks were performed. But one day as I was
                                       approaching my twelfth year Mother called me up onto the little entrance
                                       porch and suggested that I was getting to be too big a girl to romp in the
                                       streets. My soul was filled with astonishment and rage. I think I gave her
                                       no more worry on that score but I still played hop scotch even after I
                                       became a teacher much to the amazement and delight of the school children.

            <p><a name="d0e7260"></a>Then my Father's death - Angina Pectoris - the youngest of the five children,
                                       Leslie, only four years old - and the whole burden, though I fancy it never
                                       occurred to mother in the light of a burden - but the whole responsibility
                                       in every field on her alone, economic, domestic, educational, social - and
                                       how full she filled them all and her loneliness without her beloved only on
                                       the rarest of occasions becoming visible to the rest of us. Once she said to
                                       me - "When I am crossing a street in the midst of traffic I think - 'Jere
                                           <a name="145"></a> [Note: Jeremiah] is beside me and will look out for me.'" And it
                                       was a lucky thing he did for she was a holy terror in the midst of high
                                       speed traffic. In her seventies she would cross the main thoroughfares with
                                       dignity at a quiet pace utterly oblivious while drivers and motorists cursed
                                       and swore but did not touch her.

            <p><a name="d0e7282"></a>Father was adored by all who knew him. In Hubbard Woods the neighbor across
                                       the street, James Chisholm, a journalist, his wife a singer, worshiped the
                                       ground he walked on. These two were as likely to drop in on each other at
                                       2AM as any other time of day - their wives quite uncomplaining. In the wee
                                       hours it never occurred to father to abstain from waking mother, as he was
                                       turning in, to read her his latest poem or dilate on a bright idea.

            <p><a name="d0e7285"></a>For some time he was principal of one of Chicago's schools. His teachers
                                       adored him. One night not long after his death Mrs. <a name="146"></a> [Note: Ella Flagg
                                       Young?] came in with a box which she handed to Mother. Mother said,
                                       "It feels as if it were filled with gold," - took it to the beautiful old
                                       mahogany table - such a vivid picture in my mind - opened it and in truth it
                                       was filled with gold - a shining thousand dollars to give all the thrills of
                                       a miser to one who was furthest possible from being one, collected by the
                                       teachers who knew and loved them both, as an expression of their affection.

            <p><a name="d0e7291"></a>Father was one who acted on conviction of the human individual's power. When
                                       the time came for the selection of a school superintendent he determined
                                       that his old school teacher, Mr. Howland, should be the one chosen. He threw
                                       articles into all the news papers till - "such was the pressure of public
                                       opinion" - Mr. Howland was selected for the position. He and Mrs. <a name="147"></a> [Note: Ella
                                           Flagg] Young were the only great and worthy ones who have held
                                       that position in Chicago. Mrs. Young, interestingly enough, when thrown out
                                       of her position by a political mayor catering to job seekers who resented a
                                       woman's holding so remunerative a position, was reinstated through the
                                       uproar of "public opinion," this time the women of Chicago who in the midst
                                       of the turmoil had received the franchise. The women succeeded in this
                                       though all the men were saying - "If she's out she's out. It isn't possible
                                       to get her back. What you women should do is to decide on someone else who
                                       will suit you and concentrate on <u>him</u>." But the women had
                                       determined to put Mrs. Young back and they did.

                                       man in it. With the franchise in their hands the women could throw out the

                                       and then suddenly take the floor and the whole group would be aflame. Oh!
                                       these Irish! One of his poems - My Harem - written to his books was
                                       published shortly before and was almost identical with a poem by Oliver
                                       Wendell Holmes. Father wrote him about it saying if the dates had been
                                       reversed he, the unknown of the two, would certainly have been suspected of
                                       plagiarism. He received a very pleasant reply commenting on the frequency of
                                       such occurrencies and that it wasn't the first time it had happened to him,
                                       Mr. Holmes. You see things do come out of the blue if one has access to it.
                                       No rational thinker can accept the idea of chance. A creative idea when once
                                       conceived is imprinted on the others and is accessible to imaginative,
                                       though not to rational, thinkers.

                                       all the children attended. On her return from the country school Marion was
                                       placed by her in a 5th grade room with instructions to Miss Jones to pass
                                       her on to 6th grade if possible. The year would end in a month. The class
                                       was reviewing and Miss Jones pushed her through. On Father's death the only
                                       just 4 year old Leslie was put in first grade (there were no kindergartens

            <p><a name="d0e7579"></a>One of the greatest schools for thinking is one's friendships. The fact that
                                       Aunt Myra lived with us during the years after Father's death meant that we
                                       all had a second Mother and a wonderful bosom friend. A pianist and teacher,
                                       she too was a natural educator and took lessons of all the great pianists
                                       who came to Chicago in those days. So she was among those who developed a
                                       system of pedagogy in music which rapidly brought the music of the United
                                       States up to a high standard. This gave me an opportunity to see, through my
                                       own experience, how important it is for us now to take the schools out of
                                       the hands of the political organization - as important as it was a while
                                       back to take it out of the control of the church. For when I had completed
                                       my school work including the university and was ready to start practicing
                                       the arts as a profession I found I knew nothing, could do nothing. It was
                                       the custom in those days to teach drawing in the schools but not music so,
                                       since one could get the drawing for nothing, the parents accepted it as
                                       sufficient whereas with music when a child was not getting satisfactory
                                       instruction they would dismiss the teacher and put him in other hands. The
                                       drawing therefore like everything else in public schools dropped into a
                                       deadly routine of no educational value.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7582"></a>When I discovered the consequences in myself I went back, as opportunity
                                       offered, to various schools in Boston and Chicago and demanded the kind of
                                       work I required, interesting the teachers and creating quite a sensation
                                       among the students. Madame and Monsieur Pape were the teachers in Boston and
                                       when at the end of a quarter I had to leave for home and expressed my
                                       gratitude to them for all they had done for me, Mme. <a name="154"></a> [Note: Madame]
                                       wept and said I was the only student who had ever expressed any thanks
                                       though they took so much pains for them. "But," she said, "you certainly got
                                       a lot out of your quarter," and I certainly was grateful to them for it. But
                                       I had to get what I needed. I found afterwards that there was a privately
                                       run school in Chicago in the hands of an old High

            <p><a name="d0e7593"></a>School classmate of mine, Miss Church, and was thrilled to see what
                                       interesting work she was doing and what fine creative results she was
                                       getting from her pupils. So from my own experience I was able to check what
                                       I got from other sources later - that one of the most urgent necessities for
                                       establishing a true democracy was the complete separation of the educational
                                       system from the political. Only through such a step shall we be enabled to
                                       allow creative ability to develop in our young people. As was to be expected
                                       Miss Church's enterprise did not last long for at present a private school
                                       is a business, and will be until we have established an Abilities
                                       Organization to take over, and stands a small chance of being able to
                                       continue to exist in competition with government run business. It was run
                                       out of existence quite as definitely, though not so self-consciously, as the
                                       privately and efficiently run buses were run off the streets in Australia,
                                       by increasing and increasing and increasing the taxation on them. We have a
                                       chance occasionally to see such instances but how many such undertakings are
                                       killed, thwarted, or prevented from ever starting, we have no way of
                                       measuring.

            <p><a name="d0e7596"></a>I have good reason to be thankful to Aunt Myra for her continued interest in
                                       my musical education in spite of the fact that I had no special talent in
                                       that direction. For through her I became acquainted with music and even
                                       achieved a foundation which, after an interim of many years of no practice,
                                       enabled me (when the need came for me to forget myself) to practice
                                       Beethoven and other composers with sufficient satisfaction to myself to be a
                                       great and lasting healing of the soul. We learn that just as the life body
                                       (which we have in common with the plants) is a light organization, so is the
                                       soul body, builder of the nerve system, a sound organization, thus great
                                       creative powers lie in the pulling into shape of the astral body.

            <p><a name="d0e7599"></a>This enabled me to appreciate the importance of opening the doors of these
                                       realms of creative experience to all young people. I lost that close
                                       companionship with my Aunt through her death before my

            <p><a name="d0e7620"></a>marriage, but never have I lost the feeling of the continued closeness of the
                                       relationship. In later years I learned through my own experiences, which are
                                       the only basis of knowledge, that this non-material realm is a real world as
                                       varied and rich as the material world. Reason tells us it must be as it is
                                       the causal world, and the smashed atom has informed us that it is the force
                                       world. Later I learned this through perceptions which could be checked by
                                       the perceptions of others with the same exactitude as the observations of
                                       facts in the material realm. But before we had learned to make a conscious
                                       entrance into this causal realm it had been amply proved to us that the sort
                                       of things which happened to us at critical moments in our eventful lives
                                       could not be accounted for by chance. Anyway the belief in chance is
                                       contrary to reason and no truly scientific thinker can accept such an
                                       absurdity. So, even before we could be conscious of the methods of this
                                       world beyond the boundaries of our nineteenth century type of consciousness,
                                       we realized that help was being given to us by beings who were concerning
                                       themselves with what we were doing and we interpreted it as coming from
                                       loved ones who had crossed over into the realm of consciousness of which we
                                       had not yet become directly aware. And it is not mediumship nor spiritualism
                                       as generally conceived that we are speaking of.

                                       Woods for each summer long vacation. There was a bit of an adventurer, Mr.
                                       Merriles, who had started building houses West of the tracks and then, I
                                       suppose in the pinch of some depression (such an absurdity these
                                       depressions) had left them in all their various stages of completion. For
                                       years we just chose the best one of them still left and camped therein for
                                       the two months. They were gradually disposed of the best one each year being
                                       occupied the next year, so we passed down the line, but always so long as
                                       there was a roof, a floor and a few walls, it suited us perfectly. We
                                       bothered with no furniture.

                                       blanket on the floor was perfectly satisfactory to the family. There must
                                       have been some sort of cooking arrangement though I have no recollection of
                                       it, so little was cooking a part of our life, except that when we went out
                                       early in the morning for the day's adventure Mother always had one cooked

            <p><a name="d0e7634"></a>No one ever had more wonderful holidays than we. As we started on the trail,
                                       sometimes we would be joined by neighbors or sometimes by city folk who came
                                       out for a lark. Always there was the hope that we would live there again and
                                       I wept when the allotment next to ours with a sweet bit of the head of a
                                       ravine was sold to be built on. And Mrs. West, one of the original four
                                       families, watched with her heart in her throat the cutting down of trees,
                                       only a few at first, but she told me that others were dying and she was sure
                                       it was in consequence of the loss of their companions. She sensed the
                                       interrelationship of plant life whose United Ego dwells in the center of the
                                       Earth, this living Earth. Bio-dynamic agriculture is proving that natural
                                       plant groups are interdependent entities. This despoliation was slow then
                                       but rapid afterwards. Here again is one of the instances where if the United
                                       States had been a true democracy, with the Abilities Organ established, this

                                       Lake Forest would today, for all its intense occupation, be as beautiful as
                                       then giving the citizenry itself every advantage (more than they have under
                                       this system of despoliation) and retaining accessibility for all to its
                                       loveliness. This is being proved at Castlecrag for here in Hubbard Woods too
                                       the lower levels of the valleys themselves and the whole foreshores of the
                                       lake could have been retained in a park system in all its pristine grace and
                                       majesty. There can be such open beautiful spaces even in the most intensely
                                       occupied suburban districts as was proved by Mr. Griffin in the competition
                                       inaugurated by the City Club in Chicago shortly before his departure for

            <p><a name="d0e7645"></a>During the first year in High School a lifelong friendship began. Among some
                                       40 pupils in the room one young country girl made herself decidedly
                                       conspicuous by her free and easy and chatty way with the teacher. I sat
                                       quite across the room from her but had spoken to her once whereupon a pal of
                                       the moment with scorn in her voice practically instructed me to have nothing
                                       to do with that girl. My answer was to pick up my book and march over to sit
                                       down with Anna to ask her some question in grammar for she had shown herself
                                       to be clever in her studies. She was a natural gypsy - pretty and sparkling
                                       - whereas I, although I cared nothing for conventions, was in those days
                                       quiet and reserved. But the bonds between us are as close today as they were
                                       in our girlhood. My childhood had been in the country too so my thinking was
                                       not so cramped as that of the city child.

                                       sparkling gypsy, was Katherine, a dainty strawberry blond. A considerable
                                       part of my spare time after my return from Tech <a name="155"></a> [Note: Boston Tech, later
                                           renamed MIT] was spent in the study of French in that charming and
                                       very active French group in her home whose activities consummated in the
                                       establishment of the French Theatre in Chicago. This pursuit of French was
                                       my initiation in acting for where one is remote from the possibility of
                                       hearing a language this participating in drama is an especially good way to
                                       learn. Also a different language if really used is a fine training of the
                                       thinking powers and this being a thinking language was a most helpful
                                       supplement to my native will language, the English, where the verb comes
                                       early in the sentence. It was many years before I added German, a feeling

            <p><a name="d0e7678"></a>That I never became an accomplished linguist in French was evidenced by the
                                       astonishment of Mlle. Favard when one evening several of us took a train
                                       journey together and Mlle. Favard continually expressed astonishment and
                                       delight in the remarks I made saying:- "Why, everything she says is
                                       interesting!" Apparently her conversations with me in French had never given
                                       her the slightest hint of any such personal qualities.

            <p><a name="d0e7681"></a>Mrs. <a name="157"></a> [Note: Mary J.] Wilmarth coached me in French preparing me for my
                                       exams for Tech. Her naughty daughter Anna told her I had failed in French
                                       and Mrs. Wilmarth was taking the blame on herself when at last grasping the
                                       situation I told her I had passed. It was this young friend, Anna Wilmarth,
                                       who put me through the University. The only return I was ever able to make
                                       was earnestness in my work. This Anna Wilmarth was Mrs. Ickes who for many
                                       years was a Congressman in the Illinois Legislature and who resigned her
                                       position later to go to Washington with Mr. <a name="158"></a> [Note: Harold J.] Ickes
                                       when he became a member of Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet - Minister
                                           <a name="159"></a> [Note: Secretary of] for the Interior. For years she had spent her
                                       holidays in the desert of New Mexico, studying and writing of the Indian
                                       customs. She didn't do her work from the outside but became an intimate
                                       friend of the Indians and was admitted to very secret ceremonies. She
                                       learned to know the reality of their different way of thinking and never
                                       spoke of them in the light manner so customary with the rational thinkers.
                                       Her book should be a help toward making Americans willing to listen without
                                       prejudice to those who can show us how, in full consciousness, to add to our
                                       rational thinking this other method of thinking which the primitive peoples
                                       use intuitively. When we have done that our community can begin to function
                                       creatively in free will as nature beings, no longer children who quite
                                       properly have to be guided during their immaturity.

            <p><a name="d0e7704"></a>Club. I was the only girl in the club so when we gave a public performance I
                                       was cast as the countess in one of the two plays. Although at graduation I
                                       was voted as the handsomest man in my class, I was completely outrivaled in
                                       personal beauty by the countess in the other play, a blond youth who became
                                       startlingly beautiful in his feminine array. I had objected when our
                                       costumer, the teacher in painting, had instructed me to wear corsets. I said
                                       I never did wear them. He said if all the rest of the men could wear corsets
                                       I could too. I accepted his logic but laced only moderately whereas the
                                       ballet dancers pulled their corsets so tight they could scarcely swallow a
                                       mouthful of water on the night of the performance. I assumed a man's name on
                                       the program so went before the audience as a man among men. Through this
                                       innocent deception I won a great reputation for "Gerald Morse" as an actor.
                                       My play was put on first. My maid, the only other woman in the cast, was
                                       taken by a man and I learned afterwards of the many compliments:- the
                                       wonderful way in which I did a woman's role, how I put on my gloves just
                                       like a woman, and so on. But it worked a hardship on my blond rival because
                                       when he spoke his first words the audience roared with laughter, his
                                       masculinity being completely revealed in his voice.

            <p><a name="d0e7707"></a>Of my outstanding early friendships, one was Echo Simmons living with the
                                       Davises in Hubbard Woods, and a constant companion during the last years of
                                       those holidays which ended only with the finish of high school work and my
                                       start in the university in Boston in the course of architecture. Echo had
                                       come down from Minneapolis <a name="161"></a> [Note: Minnesota] in a calico gown. There
                                       would be no shock in such a procedure today but in those days, as with so
                                       many things, it simply wasn't done. Early in our acquaintance Echo walked in
                                       the 20 miles to our home in Chicago and as she entered, as cheerily as if
                                       she had dropped in from around the block, she called our - "Are there any
                                       errands I can do for you Mrs. Mahony?" Her affections were as vital as her
                                       body.

            <p><a name="d0e7729"></a>As I look back now I realize that all along the line the friends were sent to
                                       me by my guiding angel to break down the barriers of an individuality that
                                       had a natural preference for isolation. This step is the requisite after we
                                       have attained individualization in order that our Ego may reverse from
                                       concentration within our skin to an expansion in spirit till it includes
                                       humanity.

            <p><a name="d0e7732"></a>Echo would sit on a stile waiting for hours till I came along on the family
                                       jaunt for the day to the woods or the lakeshore. There was, through my life,
                                       a succession of these lovers, my husband being probably the outstanding
                                       exception for apparently it was my task to do this service for him which my
                                       friends were doing for me. During our teens Echo and I read and discussed
                                           <a name="162"></a> [Note: Herbert] Spencer and <a name="163"></a> [Note: Charles] Darwin and such
                                       like, absorbing the scientific fundaments of our time as is essential for
                                       any people in any time. Thus later one will have established a foundation
                                       from which to leap to the science of the future if fear doesn't prevent his
                                       taking it. The great service rendered by these nineteenth century thinkers
                                       was to establish in the minds of Western peoples the reality of evolution.
                                       That their interpretation of facts was topsy-turvy was a detail that could
                                       be put to rights by the thinking that was appropriate to the 20th century.

                                       now (for we scattered even to the far antipodes) and is still going strong.
                                       It has maintained a close and intimate friendship supplemented only
                                       occasionally by transient meetings and itself has always been an extremely
                                       interesting document of the lives of these typical American doers. Far apart
                                       from each other in their spheres and interests and points of view yet with
                                       the closest ties of affection, this one little unit can well make clear the
                                       absurdity of the hope so frequently expressed in these days that the
                                       solution of our social problems will come about through human beings
                                       becoming more alike. They are due to become more and more unlike as
                                       individuals though the differences of races ceased with the coming of the
                                       Christ who was "the light" and gave that light to every man who comes into
                                       the world. Since then there has been no difference between races except
                                       physical differences which are disappearing.

            <p><a name="d0e7773"></a>In the University another friend of the same name as mine, Marion, a most
                                       beautiful girl of the <a name="170"></a> [Note: Edward] Burne-Jones type tackled the
                                       stronghold of a higher classmate. The first attack was in the dressing room
                                       and the conversation that was so absorbing that we both forgot and missed
                                       the classes at which we were due. So for the succeeding years the two
                                       Marions discussed the philosophies of the Western peoples, Kant's "Critique
                                       of Pure Reason" and so on. A picture of myself was brought to my ears
                                       through a friend of Marion's who caught sight of me getting in a street car
                                       with a big drafting board and tee square with - "I saw your picturesque
                                       friend getting on the car with her big drafting board utterly
                                       unselfconscious though all eyes were turned on her." It took the journey to
                                       the antipodes in later years to shake the fixed concepts of the northern,
                                       the continental, hemisphere and to melt to the fluid of the southern
                                       hemisphere these bare bones of science with which our people rest so

                                       these wonderful friends, but my shyness perhaps in self-expression never
                                       broke down except once. With that man of mine it seemed that I was
                                       possessed. It was as if a demon took hold and shaped me to its whim. Indeed
                                       years before a friend in the office had said the surmises were that I must
                                       have been disappointed in love because I took my work so earnestly. I was
                                       devoted to my work and indeed throughout my life have been convinced that
                                       work is the one great satisfaction for human beings which means that those
                                       women who have not grown up to take a life's work seriously as our men do
                                       are being deprived of life's greatest continuous satisfaction. But when I
                                       encountered Walter Burley Griffin I was first swept off my feet by my
                                       delight in his achievements in my profession, then through a common bond of
                                       interests in nature and intellectual pursuits and then with the man himself.
                                       It was by no means a case of love at first sight but it was a madness when
                                       it struck.

            <p><a name="d0e7790"></a>The many years were packed full of every joy and every anguish till that
                                       demon who sat on my shoulder seemed to have run his gamut of possibilities
                                       in work and play together and finally through that curious conflict of
                                       interests, perhaps best expressed as a warfare of philosophies, Nietzsche
                                       was a bone of contention between us, this man who like Kant would prove one
                                       thing on one page and its opposite on the next, masters of reason both of
                                       them going insane, makes a god of it, it leaves one with no ground to stand
                                       on, for anything that can be proved can be disproved. The only basis for <u>knowledge</u> is perception, checkable perception. Not till
                                       the battle had been fought out to a finish was it possible to realize that
                                       the close companionship of marriage is the best training ground for that
                                       demon - the Ego - which presently finds it cannot continue to endure
                                       submission to any of the external worlds - neither that of the environment
                                       itself, nor that of the physical body in which it has incarnated - these two
                                       realms of law; nor to that other external world, the chaotic world of its

                                       contact with the formative forces which make it possible for him to be the

                                       Threshold of the Spiritual World, <a name="172"></a> [Note: Rudolf] Steiner says:- "In
                                       love when one really loves a person there exists in the depths of his being
                                       a terrible antipathy to that person. The antipathy is there if the love is
                                       real love."

            <p><a name="d0e7829"></a>This is the only statement I have ever heard anyone make that seemed to me
                                       true and significant except one that Emily Bronte made in which she said
                                       that if she really loved a man she would hate him as she hated herself. I
                                       myself as you may remember have said that it was absurd to look upon the
                                       marital relationship, if it were based on love, as having any relation to
                                       friendship, that it was more like that of enemies. I have told Clarmyra
                                           <a name="173"></a> [Note: MMG's niece] that one should not choose a mate as a friend
                                       but as an opponent, an opportunity worthy of her mettle. This statement of
                                       Steiner's would seem to imply that love - that there was

                                       perhaps a need that could be met only by interdependence (This is our old
                                       quarrel isn't it) a need of course not connected with physical needs.

            <p><a name="d0e7845"></a>In 1932 - Dear Edith, You ask, "Can it be Marion that he doesn't understand?
                                       Is it that he really has not seen?" In a way that is the case. He won't see
                                       and what he won't see he can't see.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7848"></a>You didn't quite get the point in regard to anger as you will see when you
                                       read the lecture. One should boil with anger. There must be anger. It is the
                                       fire that Prometheus brought down to mankind. It is the divine force that
                                       makes possible the balanced development of the Ego which is necessary for
                                       its continued existence. One can and should make better and better use of
                                       that force and should learn to transmute it into better judgments for the
                                       solution of life's riddles. <a name="175"></a> [Note: Rudolf] Steiner says that without
                                       the molding force of anger through which the Ego becomes richer and richer,
                                       the Ego reaches a point where it begins to weaken and disintegrate and that
                                       is the point where I think Walter stands.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7854"></a>I sometimes think Walter lacks the capacity for anger. I could suggest a trap
                                       to set for him to test out this point but I do not believe in testing human
                                       beings. But this is what Steiner says. He says that there are people who say
                                       they make a sacrifice in not being angry, but they can't sacrifice what they
                                       haven't got. The anger must exist. He says that one can over and over again
                                       transmute anger into judgment but the anger must exist or it can't be
                                       transmuted. That with this work of the Ego in transmuting anger it develops
                                       the qualities that are necessary for its perfection and permanence. That
                                       with this there comes a tranquility of soul and a power, but without this
                                       interplay it becomes cold and hard.

                                       a great comfort to me and I have tried since to convince myself that at
                                       times since then he was angry because it seemed to me gruesome, not human,
                                       never to be angry. But he never has been and has looked upon that as a sign
                                       of his perfection as compared to myself. Just as when I said that I could
                                       see in myself the capacity to do any or all evil things and felt that that
                                       was the basis of a capacity for sympathy with humans in general, he looked
                                       at me with shocked eyes as an evil thing feeling that his lack of any such
                                       perception in himself was another basis of his perfection. But Steiner says
                                       in his lecture on the Mystery of Death - "No self knowledge is true unless
                                       it discloses to the depth where the tendency to all possible wrong-doing
                                       dwells in us. This tendency is implanted in us in order that we may grasp
                                       spiritual life with the Consciousness soul."

            <p><a name="d0e7892"></a>I quite realize that this characteristic of Walter's has been a very valuable
                                       one in the frightful struggle he has had in his profession in Australia and
                                       that perhaps the Angels have safeguarded him for that great work but I feel
                                       very sure that the time has now come when his problem is life and not
                                       architecture and that he should shake up this perfectly clean consciousness
                                       of his and be able to see himself and others in truth and reality. To Walter
                                       all human beings, except this wife, are exactly like himself, perfect, and
                                       he never gets outside of himself in his estimate of them. This he looks upon
                                       as a virtue but it is really an incapacity to see the truth.

            <p><a name="d0e7906"></a>In the early professional days I was profoundly influenced by the Single Tax
                                       of Henry George and only many years later realized that this concept of
                                       freeing natural resources from absolute ownership of individuals needed to
                                       be supplemented with a realization that also they must not be owned by the
                                       community, the State. Ownership is a very different thing from the right to
                                       use. It is for the State to see to it that equity is maintained in the use
                                       of land. Its function is also to safeguard the land - nature - for the
                                       future not only for men but for all God's creatures. We must not continue
                                       our killing of the Earth.

                                       their group established in a city building of their own through the
                                       enterprise of Griffin, we witnessed the illuminating spectacle of the
                                       difference in feeling between the American and the Britisher. One of the
                                       finest thinkers and the most successful teacher of the Single Tax I have
                                       ever known, Mr. Renwick, debated one evening with an opponent who made just
                                       one point and kept returning to it throughout the evening and it was a
                                       pathetic spectacle to see Mr. Renwick and all his convictions go down under
                                       this onslaught for he had a son who had been killed in the war. The one
                                       point was that with the Single Tax established the Empire could not continue
                                       to exist and Mr. Renwick could see this and could not tolerate the idea and
                                       in a soul battle taking place before our eyes that night the Empire won. Mr.
                                       Renwick never recovered from that defeat of his higher self played out on
                                       the stage of his soul. He died not long after.

                                       corns he might be stepping, so ultimately he left his Chicago church and for
                                       many years continued his preaching in Evanston making no charge to the
                                       little group who gathered around him. They finally felt they were in a
                                       position to contribute to his support but he suggested that they use the
                                       funds to build a little church. I had by that time graduated from
                                           <a name="179"></a> [Note: Boston] Tech in Architecture and had had some years of
                                       practical training in office work. He suggested me as architect to which
                                       they agreed but they also selected a board of directors. This is one of the
                                       stupid methods general in our community which arises from the misplacing of
                                       the democratic ideal for in neither Economic nor Ability realms can
                                       democracy be applied. Decisions made by a majority vote in such matters
                                       cannot be correct. They are compromises. Such points as costs limitations
                                       would of course be established to begin with.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e7962"></a>The privilege of the choice of the architect in this case was properly
                                       granted to Mr. Blake since he desired to make that decision. He was in a
                                       true sense their leader and they were under obligations to him. He had had
                                       experience with my capacity as an artist, and beauty was one of the
                                       requirements of his religion; and he knew my qualifications. The board as
                                       usual, especially as it contained an architect, took pride and satisfaction
                                       in continual obstruction. Indeed how else can a board feel that it is
                                       fulfilling its function.

            <p><a name="d0e7965"></a>I had yielded on various points one requiring a complete new design. They had
                                       turned down my first which Mr. Blake realized later was a pity. The design
                                       was an octagonal motif and an unprejudiced solution of the problem. The
                                       second design was more conventional. Mr. Blake once asked me if I couldn't
                                       yield on this point or that point but I told him that if I yielded on the
                                       points they were making it would mean a total destruction of beauty in the
                                       building. Finally they suggested that we go with them to inspect a certain
                                       chapel, which we did. As we went around the building Mr. Blake kept saying -
                                       "But why have you brought us here? I couldn't preach a sermon in such a
                                       place as this."

                                       notice the height of this wall?" "Yes." "Well that is the dimension they
                                       were requiring of me." "You don't say so." "And did you notice this and

                                       "that's what they wanted." "You don't say so," said he. From that time on he
                                       stood absolutely by me, and the board had to accept those decisions. It was
                                       he who said that Marion would have a hard time if she married a man who was

                                       full of valuable historical information. Though it was banned during the war
                                       I had it on my shelves where it was always accessible. She herself was one
                                       of that trinity including Cardinal <a name="183"></a> [Note: Archbishop Daniel] Mannix and
                                       Walter Burley Griffin which really saved Australia from conscription, a very
                                       different thing in Parliamentary communities than in Congressional
                                       communities. She was a real orator with unlimited vitality. We spent a lot
                                       of time trying to convert her from communism, really but another form of
                                       dictatorship, bureaucratic dictatorship. Later her own experience converted
                                       her. But still she did not realize that the Parliamentary form is completely
                                       bureaucratic.

                                       admit from the outside world even for such a purpose) a book which changed
                                       me completely from a pessimist to an optimist, the Outline of Occult Science
                                       by Rudolf Steiner which led to my joining some time later the Society
                                       founded by him - the only Christian occultism for all other occult movements
                                       are Asiatic. Rosicrucianism was Christian but has turned to the East. Before
                                       then I had been saying what a pity the Lord, who had created the wonderful
                                       beauty of stone and bush and animal, had made the fatal mistake of creating
                                       man who devoted all his energies to destroying these beauties. But now I
                                       grasped this reversal of things and realized that, instead of man's standing
                                       at the top of a tree of evolution through these kingdoms, they had all,
                                       mineral and vegetable and animal, derived through the eons from him. Surely
                                       there was some more constructive, creative work he should be undertaking
                                       now. From this standpoint it was possible to attain a basic purpose for
                                       life. "Then," as Albert Steffen says, "One's enthusiasm for the SHAPING OF
                                       DESTINY gains more and more the upper hand over every other desire."

                                       frankly a bureaucratic government. If found undesirable it can be altered.
                                       The other European countries are parading in the guise of democracies but in

                                       must have authorized something that he would agree to if India would. Cripps
                                       arrived and the Indians did agree to the suggestion but 2 days later the
                                       cable came saying - "It can't be done." Now how could that happen! Well this
                                       is how that sort of thing does happen repeatedly. Churchill was Prime
                                       Minister. He had not yet been initiated to toe the mark as
                                       <a name="193"></a> [Note: Ramsay] MacDonald the Labor Leader had been previously. He
                                       thought he held a position of authority.

            <p><a name="d0e8199"></a>However some Civil Servant had to type out the stuff he had sent Cripps. This
                                       secretary's first allegiance would not be to the Prime Minister but to his
                                       superior Civil Servants so he passed the information on. Thereupon an
                                       official (permanent of course) came to Churchill and said - "But Mr.
                                       Churchill that can't be done." So Churchill knew he must either pass that
                                       message to Cripps or have the government thrown out of office, and a new
                                       election. He can perhaps be excused for not being honest as M.

                                       defied the whole Masonic Organization and got a Catholic - Foche

                                       his terms. (I could tell you that tale in detail if you wanted to use it.)
                                       But Churchill toed the line feeling I suppose the importance at the moment
                                       and the risks in the change in the party control in Parliament. So he toed
                                       the line.

            <p><a name="d0e8745"></a>In every department of human progress there have been long periods of groping
                                       effort, a certain amount of human accomplishment largely attributed to
                                       inspiration and a consequent vanity in those supposed to be inspired, and
                                       hero worship by the rest, a large amount of imitation on the part of others
                                       but no steady progression in the field till finally the underlying
                                       principles begin to become apparent, the laws are investigated, the whole is
                                       brought with in the scope of the intelligence. Then the accomplishments in
                                       this particular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with
                                       amazement at the results.

            <p><a name="d0e8748"></a>We have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of
                                       development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but
                                       the development of this wonderful field was very slow till the law - a
                                       purely mathematical one - of the conservation of rhythm - was understood.
                                       When we learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves
                                       with each other and the consequent destruction of sound and that the sounds
                                       that we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each
                                       other so that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a
                                       development of the art of music which is one of the miracles of the present
                                       time. A hundred years has done what all the thousand of years preceding did
                                       not begin to do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learn
                                       this fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the
                                       controlling law.

            <p><a name="d0e8751"></a>Music is a time art measured by rhythm. To satisfy the human soul these units
                                       must be preserved and must be so used as to reinforce each other, for
                                       destruction is painful to us but evidences of continuity are a joy and
                                       inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law.
                                       Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made
                                       conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elements in our present
                                       creation, and in

                                       be satisfied only when the space units we use reinforce each other and a

                                       smallest unit in our life today, one family. We take it in its simplest
                                       distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and
                                       conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its
                                       industrial development to provide effective shelter and comfortable living,
                                       though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use
                                       utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we
                                       are making of the conservation of space. Every family requires provision for
                                       the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the
                                       bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any
                                       other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom.
                                       Similarly the working quarters should be isolated, and so concentrated as to
                                       save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in
                                       closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private
                                       needs the quarters to be used in common should be so arranged as to help
                                       each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving
                                       feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary
                                       we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that
                                       would be required for a small living room and a small dining room as one
                                       room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is
                                       empty and vice verse. With a little more leeway,

                                       mystery. With a house a bit larger a half story level scheme given
                                       opportunity for a large living room with high ceiling which its greater
                                       proportions prevent being inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library
                                       opening out from the higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these
                                       rooms and a delightful feeling of openness to the whole. This arrangement is
                                       very economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages
                                       of both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation
                                       in the heights of the ceiling of those of various sizes eliminating the
                                       unpleasant proportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same
                                       level from large rooms to small rooms, and at the same time getting the
                                       feeling of openness and distance, an in addition an emphasis as pleasing in

            <p><a name="d0e8794"></a>From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two
                                       families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work
                                       together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by
                                       intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one
                                       of the streets of Evanston where the lots and houses of approximately the
                                       same size are all placed at the same distance from the other, the only idea
                                       being to get the most out of one's own lot no matter what the consequences
                                       to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look crowded and cramped for yard
                                       space, till we come to two houses that were built at the same time with the
                                       intention of making a bit of music, instead or noise. Here in spite of the
                                       fact that the size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that
                                       there is ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses
                                       have thrown their open space together, and have located themselves on the
                                       further sides of their respective lots. This means of course that an
                                       architectural problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house
                                       may have equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about

                                       size of the lots, and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there
                                       is always an advantage to be gained by working together.

                                       piece of property owned by a family <a name="203"></a> [Note: the Mueller family] of
                                       brothers who, with their wives and children, wanted cottages for their
                                       summer outings, and decided to build on this charmingly picturesque bit of
                                       woodland. Each family by this arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be
                                       built so as to destroy as little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to
                                       get as great a view as possible of the river with trails leading to each
                                       cabin from the large building nearer the main road which serves for
                                       accommodation house and entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is
                                       the common garage and caretaker's home in connection with which is the farm
                                       for raising vegetables, fruit, etc., for the whole group.

                                       illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing
                                       together of sounds does not constitute the making of music, so in Town
                                       planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as
                                       anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have
                                       all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and this
                                       law of conservation of space has been observed as in music the sound wave
                                       must be conserved. Some illustrations will make this clear.

            <p><a name="d0e8871"></a>Ridge Quadrangles <a name="206"></a> [Note: Evanston, Illinois] is a really startling
                                       example of what a little geometry will do. I shall not blame anyone who
                                       refuses to believe what I say because we ourselves could not believe our
                                       eyes till we measured and counted over and over again. However we have had
                                       similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of
                                       course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more
                                       economical is the result in terms of cold cash. In other words it is only
                                       when we work for ideal ends that we achieve practical results. When brought
                                       into the office it had been laid out as shown by the small scale drawing.
                                       The alley so unnecessary in a residence district had been left out. It was
                                       the intention to build two-family apartments on all the 50 foot lots. The
                                       long axis of the houses was placed parallel to the street and the houses
                                       staggered giving light and outlook on 3 or 4 directions instead of the usual
                                       2. By substituting domestic ways for one thoroughfare and somewhat
                                       diminishing the depth of lots one acre parks in the smaller blocks and a
                                       five acre park in the larger block were obtained. The increased value given
                                       to all the lots would probably build a comfortable club house.

            <p><a name="d0e8877"></a>In contrast with this residence subdivision on perfectly flat land is the one
                                       at Grinnell <a name="207"></a> [Note: Iowa] where the somewhat rolling ground of the town
                                       as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking
                                       illustration of the impractical nature of the so-called practical ways of
                                       doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues
                                       fails to see beyond its nose and, curiously enough, fails in consequence to
                                       accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact
                                       that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the
                                       parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having
                                       decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives
                                       him the best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the
                                       straight streets across this property, and had actually sold

            <p><a name="d0e8888"></a>several lots before he realized the difficulty he was getting into, for when
                                       it came to putting in service, as sewers bumping up hill and down dale with
                                       the streets it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the
                                       pipes for the higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or
                                       there would be backing up of the sewage in the lower houses. So the problem
                                       was brought to a technical man for solution. By making the streets follow
                                       the bottom of the ravines these difficulties and extravagances were entirely
                                       overcome. By recognition of the nature of the location which made it
                                       essentially a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide
                                       pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that
                                       instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66, that
                                       is 9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the
                                       average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there
                                       was an increase of 30% in the salable frontage which, taking the prices
                                       previously set increased the profits of the sale by $15,000. In addition all
                                       the houses were located on the higher land, none in the hole, and the whole
                                       took on the look of a park and became in consequence the most attractive
                                       district in the town.

                                       desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first
                                       ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they were laying
                                       out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with
                                       cross streets necessitating steep gardens in numerous cases and with no park
                                       space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated even if the
                                       profits are to be increased but again that was not the case.

                                       150' in depth, and when the count of lots was made there were still as many

            <p><a name="d0e8944"></a>If the civilization of a people can be measured by the happiness of its
                                       children, all of its children, and the opportunities opened to them for full
                                       development of all their faculties, physical, mental and spiritual, then
                                       very low indeed does the civilization of our people fall when measured by
                                       this standard.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8947"></a>The religion of democracy requires that the opportunities for complete
                                       development shall be open on even terms to all human beings born into this
                                       earthly sphere. The basis essential for accomplishing this is that natural
                                       resources - made by no man therefore no man's property - should be open to
                                       the use of all. In a society based on this simple justice all children would
                                       find ample facilities for such constant contact with nature as to assure
                                       them physical health, mental stimulus and moral enlightenment.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8950"></a>Failing in this, the least we can do is to provide all children with access
                                       to open spaces for the play which is a vital necessity for their
                                       development; especially when we find that such playgrounds can be provided
                                       without any increased expenditure at all.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e8953"></a>The accompanying are illustrations of two methods of subdivisions of city
                                       property, one the generally accepted method providing no playground space at
                                       all except the streets, and the other providing such playground space. The
                                       slight modification as shown in this illustration gives playground space in
                                       direct connection with every home, five acres in the interior of the large

                                       haven't always been done. Their not having been done simply goes to show
                                       that human beings amble through life without bothering to think. What we
                                       usually dub thinking in an off hand way is purely an automatic process.
                                       Indeed even highly developed reasoning may become automatic. But here we are
                                       not considering ordinary thinking but creative thinking, thinking which
                                       diverges from the straight beaten paths into curves, devious, surprising,
                                       charming; thinking that calls for action and consummation in deeds. We must
                                       learn to think in terms of the future.

                                       outside of nature can choose either way, the stupid or the inspired. Here it
                                       was that I was awakened to the magic that can lie in town planning if it
                                       escapes from the boundaries of what is being done.

                                       for 200 families in 100 two family buildings had, to be sure, eliminated the
                                       wasteful alley giving that much additional living outdoor space. A common
                                       heating plant for the group was also incorporated which facilitated other
                                       community services. An equipment duct extended continuously through the
                                       basements of the buildings involving no additional excavation, obviating not
                                       only street pipes but all stubs and connections, accessible throughout,
                                       conservative of heat and preventing of all leakage of other forms of energy

                                       across the property, reducing the widths of these streets since they were no
                                       longer thoroughfares, and to make the lots 100 feet deep. I did so and found
                                       there had sprung up three interior parks, seven acres in all. I counted the

                                       feet. Thinking I must have counted wrong I added them again. The same
                                       answer. I presented it to Mr. Griffin expressing my astonishment but there
                                       was no surprise there. It was, "Yes of course." It took no more than that to

                                       glimpsed the fact that, though rational thinking does not suffice for the
                                       solving of life problems, there can be creative thinking.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9139"></a>Some time ago rational thinking was discovered by two men independently,
                                       Abraham and Aristotle. That kind of thinking sufficed for a millennium or
                                       two, supplemented occasionally by genius (a kind of intuitive thinking,
                                       really a gift of the gods). Nowadays no one understands intuitive thinking
                                       so the gods are ceasing to give these gifts. Now we have to learn them. And
                                       rational thinking cannot solve life's problems. Rational thinking was
                                       necessary for a period to accomplish a quite different end, to make freedom
                                       possible. But now the creation of a new type of thinking is as urgent as the
                                       creation of rational thinking was for the periods beginning with Abraham and
                                       Aristotle.

            <p><a name="d0e9142"></a>To comprehend totalitarianism it is necessary, as with all polarities, to
                                       know its polar opposite. Without down there can be no up, nor an inside
                                       without an outside nor matter without spirit.

            <p><a name="d0e9145"></a>Totalitarianism is but the latest phase of Hebraic thinking, of rational
                                       thinking. To get rid of Hebraic thinking, if current methods were to be
                                       generally adopted, one would have to banish from the earth all westerners as
                                       versus Easterners whose gods are multiple whereas the western God is unity,
                                       the God of Abraham, the God of nature, the Father God. This oneness is the
                                       God to which logical thinking leads us. It is the Hebraic as versus the
                                       Christian God. With the coming of the Christ the <u>concept</u>
                                       of Threeness arose in religion. Two thousand years have passed and men have
                                       not grasped it yet. For some 1,500 years faith sufficed to carry humanity,
                                       but the last 500 years have destroyed the power of faith. Rational thinking
                                       has no place for faith and under

                                       only sound foundation, the next step in evolution to succeed faith, is
                                       knowledge, and rational thinking does not lead to knowledge, it leads only
                                       to self-confidence, a necessary step in evolution as it is the basis of <u>free will</u>, but free will can function only destructively
                                       unless supplemented by <u>knowledge</u>. That is the twoness,
                                       the duality, essential for this period of human evolution.

            <p><a name="d0e9165"></a>Now what is the present foundation stone of knowledge? It is the concept of
                                       trinity. The primordial concept of Trinity was the gift of the God Christ.
                                       (In the period of the Greek civilization.) All knowledge derives from
                                       concepts. Animals cannot gain knowledge because only to man was that
                                       primordial concept directly given, the concept - causality. That was the
                                       gift of the Father God and through perception (also directly given) all
                                       nature is the school through which we can gradually come to a comprehension
                                       of causality, oneness. Two was the number first created, the creator and the
                                       created - two. (Before that there was neither unity nor multiplicity.) From
                                       this we derive the concept of one. With these developed we can attain to
                                       threeness numerically first and later, with divine help, to Trinity which
                                       constitutes a true unity, as in a circle which consists of a center, a
                                       radius of definite length and a circumference - a true unity.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9168"></a>The gift of the Christ was the concept of the Primordial Trinity - the
                                       Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (that light which lighteth every man
                                       that cometh into the world). From that time there ceased to be different
                                       races, only individual differences.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9171"></a>So the polar opposite of Totalitarianism, of oneness, is Trinity, true unity.
                                       The time is ripe for our developing our Societies on Christian instead of
                                       Hebraic lines. And nowhere do we see that being done for all our states by
                                       whatever name they are being called, are Totalitarian. They divide into two
                                       groups, one efficient and so arresting our attention and very convincing to
                                       our logical habits of

                                       by conflicting elements which have their proper field elsewhere, as liberty,
                                       but which have no place in the realm of equity, of morals. Thus it could

                                       from lack of clear thinking. The problem is how to transform the <u>circulation</u> of capital, not its distribution, so that it
                                       may not be something oppressive. The evils of capital derive not from
                                       capital per se, not from its ownership by private individuals as versus
                                       ownership by the community as a whole, or the State, but from its <u>ownership</u> as versus the right to <u>use</u>
                                       it. And we should grasp that capital, and so all the advantages that come
                                       from it, can be created only by the spiritual capacities, or the abilities,
                                       either spiritual or physical, of <u>individuals</u> and
                                       therefore that capital for use should be available for all ability, but not
                                       ownership which would give the iniquitous (the inequitable) privilege to
                                       individuals or State of placing capital in the hands of those who have not
                                       the ability to use it advantageously, productively. Of all forms of

                                       is not necessary that individuals should <u>own</u> capital
                                       which method gives rise to a tendency to pass capital on to inefficient
                                       people. What is necessary is that individuals should have the <u>use</u> of capital. So the elimination of the ownership of capital so
                                       long as it is complete and abolishes State ownership as well as private
                                       ownership will bring about not only as efficient but a more efficient social
                                       system. Access for use can and should be given in as large amounts as are
                                       required for maximum efficiency. Thus if an entity has a function to
                                       fulfill, it must have an organ to fulfill it. If it has 3 different
                                       functions to fulfill it must have 3 organs to fulfill them. So it must be
                                       with human societies. Thus is the conflict between the East and the West
                                       brought to an end, the polarity resolved into a trinity, the Earth become a
                                       true Unity. At the present moment the soundest step would be the
                                       co-operation of America and Asia bringing together the Political and
                                       Economic elements leaving the madness of Europe, the Will Group, to cool and
                                       ultimately take its place in the WORLD ORGANIZATION.

            <p><a name="d0e9374"></a>Engineering is the basis of architecture under the American system and has
                                       been till very recently the dominating influence. The great advance that
                                       architecture has made is not in the field of academic and scholastic
                                       architecture but in engineering feats, and the complaint I have to register
                                       is that these engineering feats have not been accompanied by adequate
                                       architectural development, that they have not been led by architecture and
                                       made to express architecture or the fundamentals of architecture. Our
                                       education in architecture is a reminiscence of Feudalism, as Louis H.
                                       Sullivan has expressed it, which is carrying into a time of democracy, the
                                       real essential mental attitude of the Middle Ages, looking to authority for
                                       our beliefs and thoughts. To my mind democracy should be the essential of
                                       our thought. We have realized the democratic trend for a long time now in
                                       politics especially but we have not begun to follow it into other phases of
                                       life where the necessity is not so plain. Democracy as I define it is
                                       independence of thought. Democracy in politics is independence of action,
                                       but action must be dominated by thought, and unless our thought is
                                       independent we are still in a feudalistic environment. The trouble with our
                                       education is that it has brought conventions in as authority and these
                                       conventions are the first thing that the student is taught. The first thing
                                       that he is brought into contact with in architecture is the classic "order"
                                       universal in European civilization. It was my own experience. I went through
                                       the mill and I would probably have followed the lines others had if I had
                                       not had the advantage of contact with an independent thinker in Chicago, Mr.
                                       Louis H. Sullivan. His emphasis was always laid on the essential connection
                                       between the structure and the use to which the building was to be put, and
                                       the expression of it in form. In other words "Form follows function" is the
                                       slogan Sullivan laid down years ago, evolved in his own experience

            <p><a name="d0e9399"></a>The basis of my idea is an assumption that I have seen laid down that every
                                       child born onto the earth is a genius in one of three directions, either as
                                       a scientist in the observation of nature - an investigator of the truths of
                                       nature - or an inventor - an experimenter and contriver of mechanical
                                       processes - or an artist who gives form to these utilitarian things. And
                                       teachers in the primary stages of education are willing to corroborate that
                                       assumption. They find numerous evidences. There has been poetry composed by
                                       immature children equal to anything that is written in the language, but a
                                       few years of school training is all that is required to obliterate any
                                       sparks of ingenuity or any gleam of truth of expression in those children.
                                       They are taught that the other man has set an ideal, that the other man has
                                       expressed a thought, and that he is unapproachable. After this has been
                                       sufficiently impressed on the mind of the pupil it is enough to kill any
                                       originality or freedom to do good work.

                                       materials have changed even in the last ten years. In the last 25 years
                                       conditions have altered so completely from those of preceding times that we
                                       can hardly find a way to adapt the preceding architecture to the present
                                       conditions, yet the greatest ingenuity of architects of the present day is
                                       just in that direction. The results are usually incongruous, very difficult
                                       to explain or excuse. Nor with the idea that the Greek or Goth or some other
                                       highly educated peoples have said the final word in architecture are we
                                       going to be able to express our idea in steel and concrete. We are building

                                       those buildings cannot approach anything in Medieval France or in Ancient

            <p><a name="d0e9424"></a>The difficulty is to put that into practice in the schools. I have heard it
                                       said, "What would you do? Would you give students blank pieces of paper and
                                       expect them to concoct magnificent designs forthwith without looking up the
                                       books?" I would not expect anybody to create a magnificent design in the
                                       beginning, and I do not think the pupil need to set out to do such a thing.
                                       I was taught, and the education of my time was, that the students should
                                       have big problems to work out to give themselves a chance to express the
                                       best there was in architecture before they were forced to go into a life of
                                       building warehouses, residences and railroad stations. I think the sequence
                                       ought to be reversed. My first problem in actual practice was a poultry
                                       house. (laughter) If I were to go in for teaching architecture I would put
                                       that difficulty, or something similar, up to a pupil as his first example
                                       and then let him build up from the bottom. It would not tax his ingenuity
                                       probably to build a poultry house a little better that he had seen. (hear,
                                       hear, and laughter) And after that he would take a second step in
                                       architecture. My second problem was a stable, a small one. (laughter) That
                                       was fortunate. It was the right process. I did not have to borrow anything
                                       to start with, and I started with necessities alone. The total investment
                                       was 60 dollars in the first building and 300 dollars in the second. If you
                                       divide those figures by five you will know what they represent in your
                                       money. (laughter)

                                       to buildings or on to canvas or anywhere applied but it is the doing of some

                                       was glad that the schools in the United States had been so closely allied
                                       with the Engineering Schools, and I think therein will be their salvation;
                                       not that engineering will dominate, but that it will be just the other way
                                       when its essential relationship to architecture has been understood.

            <p><a name="d0e9438"></a>The jerry builder, I take it, is a natural product of architecture as it is
                                       taught. (laughter &amp; applause) In the first place the architect does
                                       not stoop to solve the problem of the jerry builder's attempts to get the
                                       maximum result for the least money, but when the architect does get really
                                       down to that bedrock principle he is able to drive out the jerry builder. I
                                       have had some experience in putting enough time into the study of a &pound;400
                                       working man's cottage to make it cheaper than the jerry builder could make
                                       it, and get more results for the same money, and that sort of thing has led
                                       to a repetition of that particular design. Then I found that combining house
                                       units and working them out in what appeared to me to be the most economic
                                       way the largest problems could be solved, with results no jerry builder ever
                                       thought of, in the correlating of groups for convenience and effectiveness
                                           <a name="226"></a> [Note: N-YHS substitutes "attractiveness"] around the garden cities
                                       of England, where an effort to compete has been made, the jerry builder's
                                       sale sign does not bring its result. The people are going into these
                                       communities that have been carefully, economically and scientifically
                                       planned, and are leaving the jerry builder high and dry.

            <p><a name="d0e9444"></a>Architecture, as it has been taught, is based on convention, and is thus a
                                       cult which the man on the street is not initiated into, and while we suggest
                                       the glory that was Greece, or the splendor that was Rome, he knows nothing
                                       of what we are driving at, and consequently becomes disinterested in the
                                       whole subject and indifferent. It is a remarkable fact that savage people
                                       build well and beautifully.

            <p><a name="d0e9463"></a>We cannot find a sample of savage building or even or animals erecting such
                                       monstrosities as some of our structures. They have no architectural cult.
                                       Architecture is so real and necessary a thing in primitive lives that the
                                       average man takes an interest in it, which accounts for the beauty of a
                                       Polynesian village as compared <a name="227"></a> [Note: "with" inserted in N-YHS] the
                                       Colonial Settlement alongside. Everywhere that primitive man has constructed
                                       he has done so with the idea or beauty of architecture, hand in hand with
                                       the idea of construction, proving to me that there is an intuitive quality
                                       in the human mind, that the human mind has the faculty of judging rhythm, of
                                       rhyme, of these beauties that are poetical; that it demands those things in
                                       its work, but when it is diverted in its appreciation of architecture, to
                                       things which are irrelevant, it becomes confused, and finally it abandons
                                       the whole thing to the architect or takes what it can get without the
                                       architect, because it does not understand what the architect is trying to
                                       give it. The architect is trying to teach <a name="228"></a> [Note: reach?] too much.
                                       Ferguson <a name="229"></a> [Note: James Fergusson?] said that architecture died in the
                                       year 1500, and I think that the corroborative evidence is very strong.
                                       Before that time architecture to count had to be homogeneous. If we are
                                       going to have architecture count for anything in a city we shall need to
                                       have a common basis running through all buildings. Where the architect is
                                       permitted, as he is by his cult, to take his authority from wherever he
                                       pleases, he is bound to disagree with his colleagues as to which precedent
                                       to adopt, and will put his Gothic design alongside the other's Classic
                                       building, and we have not seen a place where we have been able to prevent
                                       that. So whatever beauty one has got into his own building is nullified by
                                       the contrasting beauty of an adjoining one. No wonder "the man in the
                                       street" is "up in the air." He gets no effect. He sees 2 buildings, and we
                                       cannot get him into the habit of looking at one facade at a time. He is very
                                       apt also to look at the back end of the building. Another hypothesis taken,
                                       which is

                                       year 1500, and see architecture as it was practiced without cult or without
                                       self-consciousness, and where the average is high there genius does not
                                       appear, and does not have to appear. Perhaps the word genius is simply an
                                       expression of low average. (laughter) The basis of our study, I think, is
                                       Nature itself. If we can go into Nature that has been undefiled by man we
                                       can get beauty equal to that of any primitive architecture, or we have the
                                       architecture of the plants and of the animals, where nature's laws are
                                       allowed to work themselves out. These laws are inviolate in the emphasis of
                                       structural necessity, and taking advantage of natural conditions, and
                                       expressing those conditions with the maximum possibility. The law of the
                                       survival of the fittest dictates that. (hear, hear)

                                       the noble laws of gravity. When the roof recedes to form the wall line it is
                                       in essence a flat roof though the method of the disposal of the water
                                       requires slopes which may sometimes be visible as a hip. With the very
                                       simple forms often imposed by a small flat roofed house they are often much
                                       more effective, powerful, in reality than can appear in a picture rendering,
                                       as in the case with the Egyptian pyramids. In the reality they are
                                       breathtaking if the spirit of mathematics is there.

            <p><a name="d0e9527"></a>When a true creative work has been done it is a permanent thing. It consists
                                       in bringing into form harmonious with cosmic laws the other etheric
                                       formative forces. From that time on this creation is accessible to all human

                                       inspirationally. It is a curious thing how unfruitful Wright's work has been
                                       apparently because of the poison of his spirit of personality and

                                       influence of <a name="231"></a> [Note: Louis H.] Sullivan and Griffin has spread far and
                                       wide and now that the Wright incubus has been shed modern architecture,
                                       creative architecture, is taking root. It is long overdue. The men of this
                                       period should be thinking creatively, spiritually, though creative work is
                                       always in the nature of sacrifice. It is the giving of oneself and to be
                                       wholesome must be wholehearted, not niggardly. And the world should not be
                                       buffaloed by claims to spiritual works, they are the gift of the Gods not
                                       the work of men.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9541"></a>The difference in the two attitudes is expressed in the difference of the
                                       constitution of the two offices. Griffin's office from the very start was
                                       completely democratic, that is based on equity with no hang-over of European
                                       imperialism. The draftsmen were always free to do their own work in their
                                       own time in or out of the office knowing it would arouse no objectional
                                       feeling but would get helpful advice if they wanted it. When a draftsman
                                       developed a clientele of his own he could enter into a democratic
                                       partnership with the office so that he did not have to cease earning a
                                       salary and face the risks of the early stages of establishing a private
                                       practice. Later he was under no compulsion if he wanted to separate from
                                       that partnership. The resulting standard of the outgoing or instaying young
                                       architects was remarkable. One who went out was Mr. Taylor who sat in the
                                       offices in America of Hollywood designing sets which have had great
                                       influence in the architecture. One who stayed in was Mr. <a name="232"></a> [Note: Eric
                                       M.] Nicholls who in his early days did some remarkable things, one a
                                       multi parallelepipedon pyramidal design for a war memorial, and who is now
                                       carrying on a fine practice in Australia based on the no compromise with
                                       one's principles, which was true of the whole of Griffin's lifetime
                                       practice.

            <p><a name="d0e9576"></a>In these earliest houses Griffin proved to the electricians as well as the
                                       owners that indirect lighting was no more expensive and far pleasanter than

            <p><a name="d0e9590"></a>This living room is 13 feet by 23 feet with an 8 foot 6 inch ceiling. The top
                                       of the cove is placed 17 inches below the ceiling. There is a total wattage
                                       consumption of 200 watts, or .67 watt per square foot. This furnishes the
                                       entire illumination for the room, with an easy reading intensity of light.
                                       The piano portable lamp is for use when it is not desired to illuminate the
                                       entire room, but simply to read the sheet music.

            <p><a name="d0e9593"></a>In the illumination of the home, the architect and illuminating engineer
                                       comes closer in contact with his client than in any other branch of his
                                       work. He is given a chance to work up many original and decorative ideas
                                       embodying special features which will harmonize with the general decorative
                                       scheme of the various rooms.

            <p><a name="d0e9596"></a>Until recently, practically no attention was paid to the lighting of these
                                       rooms when drawing up the specifications. This matter was left to the owner,
                                       who generally seemed to hold the opinion that the room which is best lighted
                                       is most lighted. As a result, a great many of our otherwise beautiful homes
                                       are glaring examples of inefficient lighting, which are not even comfortable
                                       to sit in.

            <p><a name="d0e9599"></a>Corrected practice dictates that some way be devised to conceal the bare lamp
                                       from view. It is also believed that well diffused illumination very largely
                                       minimizes the effect of glare and deep shadows making for a soft, efficient
                                       light.

                                       to this economic period but to the preceding period of barter; but <u>land</u>, natural resources, and play. Play is what we do for
                                       the sheer joy of doing it, the fascination of using our abilities.

            <p><a name="d0e9762"></a>These two, natural resources and human ability, create values and are the

            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9765"></a>We recognize that land is a gift of the Gods and the fairies and can belong
                                       to no man though each and all have equal right to use it so long as they do
                                       not injure nor destroy it. The fairies build the vegetable kingdom but it
                                       takes the great primal spirits of mathematics to create the crystals - the
                                       universes.

                                       ancestors, but to our own development in past incarnations. The direct
                                       attack of labor on land suffices for mere existence. It gives us certain
                                       primal commodities for exchange, but not wealth. But with the introduction
                                       of spirit, of creative ability, we get capital which can be accumulated; we
                                       get technique which brings about division of labor which enormously
                                       increases wealth and we get diversified <u>means of
                                          production</u> which are the expression of <u>ability</u>, of
                                       spirit, in the economic realm.

                                       play, belong? To our ancestors we might say. But how can this be put into
                                       actual practice, how can we pay this debt?

                                       opportunities to all members of the succeeding generation. This will make it

            <p><a name="d0e9850"></a>In our first lesson we made with our arms the shape of the Cosmic Circle
                                       which holds all things.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9853"></a>We then drew the shape and inside it made as many drawings as possible, the
                                       sun, the moon, the stars the sea, us, etc., in color.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9856"></a>(The teacher had prepared large sheets of paper before-hand on which she had
                                       drawn with a compass the circle, the drawings were therefore co-operative
                                       ones.) Outside the circle we painted blue (water-color).
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9859"></a>When this was finished we again made the circle shape with our arms, and
                                       became acquainted with<br> (a) circle-like motion.<br> (b) Our eyes
                                       contain a tiny copy of the circle.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9866"></a>We found the secret in the circle, the vertical line, and as this series of
                                       lessons was to lead to plant drawing we found as follows.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9869"></a>A large piece of paper was given to each child, they creased it down the
                                       middle, and painted along the crease (in a color) a vertical line.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e9872"></a>We made this line swell and grow sideways, teacher painting one side for
                                       them, children carefully painting the other side. After this the children
                                       invented the first shape themselves.
            </p>

                                       correct, that is it must be kept in two dimensions with no creating of
                                       illusions as to there being no wall there by clever three dimensional
                                       stunts. This is the best lesson in the painting realm that the artist could
                                       give to the children because the art of painting has been degraded by this
                                       working with three dimensions which belongs to the arts of sculpture and
                                       architecture, just as music is the one dimensional art, sequence. These are
                                       the universal languages of space, spirit and time. Color is not a material
                                       thing. It is the mediator between spirit and matter, as is the rainbow.

            <p><a name="d0e10038"></a>This conclusion is confirmed by spiritual investigation through which we
                                       learn that painting derives in pre-rational times from direct perception in
                                       the etheric realms, the realm of color - two dimensional, non-substantial.
                                       And our own experiences of supersensible living pictures confirm this. Such
                                       experiences enable us to understand that the superb decorative work of
                                       ancient civilizations derive from that different kind of thinking which is
                                       now so important for us to learn to use as a supplement to reason which
                                       works in only one dimension, for these same etheric forces are the ones
                                       which enter into the vegetable kingdom, the life forces which distinguish it
                                       from the mineral kingdom. When we have become aware of, can perceive, these
                                       forces we are in a position to carry our scientific investigations on from
                                       the mineral into the vegetable kingdom, the life realm, which rational
                                       science, so-called natural science, cannot do. Not even <a name="244"></a> [Note: Charles]

                                       Imaginative work does not bring fatigue. Science, Geography, History, should
                                       all be presented in art forms. Mathematics too for geometry should precede

                                       and stir the mind by its pattern. The children will thus be helped to rest
                                       satisfied with their own work only when they themselves have created a

                                       observers will not be satisfied with a passing glance and thereafter forget
                                       to look again but that every time they pass the picture they will be caught

                                       matter, form held by reciprocal forces. The smashing of the atom has

                                       scorned by the sophisticates of the 19th century but with which the children
                                       of the 20th century must come in contact if they are to carry on the

                                       our community, so rich in toys and tools, into a real civilization thereby
                                       attaining great and worthwhile ends. For this, human beings must develop

                                       hired Mrs. Griffin. "I didn't hire her," she said, "I got down on my knees
                                       to her." And this was the splendid spirit all the way through. The subject
                                       was a group of fairies high in a birch tree helping the mother heron to feed
                                       the babes in her nest, the father heron winging his way from a distance
                                       helped by other fairies to carry more supplies of fish. It was five feet

                                       to watch its progress, and free were the discussions, as with the children
                                       in my sister's room <a name="245"></a> [Note: Georgine was a teacher at Armstrong], as to
                                       whether there really were fairies. One small boy asked Miss Reynolds as she
                                       came in the room whether she believed in fairies. "Why of course I do," she
                                       answered. One small six year old agnostic was reported to me so I took issue
                                       with him. He said his father said there were no fairies. I said, "But who
                                       made the flowers and the leaves of the plants?" He said "My father said God
                                       did." I said, "But if your father manufactured chairs, he would have to have
                                       many helpers in his factory; so God has to have many helpers with the many
                                       things he creates." Two small girls were heard by the lunch-room cook
                                       discussing, as they sat on the curbstone, whether there really were fairies.

                                       enough sport to let me give a talk to the graduating students in which I
                                       explained to them that the kind of thinking that enabled them to see the
                                       fairies was the same kind of thinking that made people able to function as
                                       geniuses so, if they wanted to be among the geniuses in their work, they
                                       must be ready to develop that kind of thinking which someday would enable
                                       them to see the fairies.

                                       class together so I suggested that we carry on our German study by
                                       translating together Dr. <a name="247"></a> [Note: Rudolf] Steiner's lecture on prayer,
                                       which we did. I had found much delight in her two older children and we
                                       often had discussed Annette's baby reports of the fairies she saw

                                       foreshores, in the caves, among the ever-blossoming shrubs and trees.
                                       Frequently Annette would stop, calling the attention of her parents,
                                       exclaiming, "Oh look at that little fellow," pointing him out with excited
                                       interest. Mrs. Trinick had told me these things because I knew there were
                                       fairies and had told her of the nature of their work in building up plant
                                       life - the gnomes in breaking down the rocks for the penetration of the
                                       tender roots; the undines the chemists who built up stem and leaves; the
                                       sylphs forming and painting the flowers; the fire-fairies building fruit and
                                       seed.

            <p><a name="d0e10139"></a>The child Annette was a beautiful thing, looking indeed like a child of the
                                       Moon. Later on when she had lost this faculty, as most children do now when
                                       they pass their third year, she still remembered, doubtless because her
                                       parents had been sympathetic and receptive, and so sometimes she asked why
                                       she didn't see the fairies any more. We told her that in these days people
                                       as they grew older had to learn to see the fairies. In discussions that
                                       arose with other children when her school days began, she quite overmatched
                                       an occasional small rationalist who contemptuously said there were no
                                       fairies by answering flat that there were fairies - she had seen them. This
                                       usually ended the argument for what one has seen one knows and her
                                       conviction based on experience was convincing.

            <p><a name="d0e10142"></a>One day instead of her coming up to read with me, I went down the hill to see
                                       Mrs. Trinick. As I approached I saw someone going into her house, a
                                       tradesman, so I stopped before going on till he was gone. As I stood on the
                                       hillside scattered over with yellow hawksbill blossoms I thought what a
                                       lovely thing it would be if I myself could see a fairy, of how the reporting
                                       of such an experience to her who was such a lover of children would help her
                                       to realize the reality of the spiritual world and of spiritual beings.

                                       sudden the whole hillside blossomed out with lovely brilliant blue little
                                       beings moving about, dashing here and there between the plants - millions of
                                       them like living blue flames almost filling the space all over the hillside
                                       between the flowers. It was a lovely and wonderful sight. It was the undines
                                       I saw at their work. When I checked on this later with others who had seen
                                       them they confirmed in detail what I had seen. I was happy to be able to
                                       report this to Mrs. Trinick and felt that they had shown themselves to me
                                       because they too wanted to comfort a loving and grieving mother. At other
                                       times I have seen the fire-fairies, the salamanders, who like little golden
                                       comets dash about condensing the light to feed and form the fruit. I have
                                       never seen the other fairies though there are, among my friends, those who
                                       have.

            <p><a name="d0e10166"></a>The mothers on Castlecrag divided up the week in taking charge of the small
                                       children, one specializing on pottery, one dancing, one on botanical jaunts
                                       and so on. In my Saturday morning art lessons, if lessons they could be
                                       called, with babies up to their sixth year, we gave free reign to our
                                       fantasy to which knowledge lent wings. The qualities of numbers figured
                                       large in our plays and the children thrilled to it, fresh as they had come
                                       from the great Spirits of Mathematics. Wholeness we swung and drew and
                                       painted, the red circle of the primal warmth condition of our universe. And
                                       in our great circles we dotted sun and stars and earth and moon. We went
                                       straight from that to trinity which they adored. It was an endless source of
                                       games and pictures and discoveries, this threeness which is true unity. For
                                       years they brought me new trinities, never once three indiscriminate things,
                                       always a true trinity, and with such rapture - clover leaf or a newly
                                       discovered flower, the butterfly's wing and drawings of angel's wings, and
                                       fairies' wings. And what excitement there was in the Guy family when the
                                       calla lily opened and was no sooner open than Bronwen discovered the

                                       <a name="250"></a> [Note: Nicholls?], a five year old who had been building up
                                       intersecting circles within a big circle. "Is that how it's done," he said.
                                       And you could see the satisfaction he took in his creative work. And this
                                       five-year-old spent the whole afternoon working out some dozen designs,
                                       really interesting, in circles of various sizes. Later we had twoness, the
                                       oval and the crescent moon, and dad's eyes stuck out when his four year old
                                       daughter told him you couldn't have an up without a down, nor an inside
                                       without an outside, nor the visible without the invisible, nor matter
                                       without spirit. He felt his own materialism breaking down under the assured
                                       statements of his baby girl. They learned that all animals' bodies and man's
                                       own are a twoness that came when their divine origins were compressed from
                                       the circle to the oval, and with swinging movements we drew on the
                                       black-board fish and birds, horses and tigers, and with the wave - the
                                       crescent moon, the origin of twoness, the dragon, the hissing snake and swan

                                       seed-pod," she told her mother. And the fairy lore of the bush, the scribbly
                                       gum, the Eucalyptus Haemastoma, where the fairies wrote their messages. Such

                                       discovered by folding the equilateral triangle in two three times to form a
                                       pyramid and painting the forms within the hexagon with alternate blue and
                                       red - a sixness - that lovely floral form. "The secret in the mother's
                                       heart," I said. "A boy and a girl," said Kaaren <a name="251"></a> [Note: Deans?], and
                                       then with their equilaterals they built the hexagon, that bond between the
                                       physical and the spiritual (for you can't make a solid from hexagons) with
                                       which one can do so many lovely things - the pattern on the turtle's back,
                                       endless flowers, new stars and suns in combination with the trinity itself.
                                       And the dragons on the blackboard appeared again with father and child,
                                       father and child swinging as a great dragon down the hillside - the

                                       for instance when it solidifies expands. We can see this in the forms its

                                       form in Australia. The fern with spores has become a tree there. They came
                                       up from the South pole. The Auracaria too so formal in its growth, the
                                       precursor of the pines. The water lily foretells the cactus.

                                       ethers shape the leaves, from circular to triangular. Australia's Archangel
                                       was the greatest of artists playing with forms. Griffin emulated him in
                                       playing with forms. We find lovely painting in the coloring of the barks
                                       vivid in the Angophora Costale.

                                       thinking in the species individual man himself. The difficulty arises out of
                                       incapacity to recognize authority except as a unity whereas it can be
                                       conceived of as a trinity. The human being is of spirit, soul and body and
                                       his threeness is a wholeness, made up of distinct elements: - the
                                       assimilative system exemplified by the stomach, the regulatory system by the
                                       heart and the nervous system by the head.

                                       as we learn how. A society whose institutions are based on its threefold

                                       temperament advised me not to take all the courses the university offered;
                                       but on my return home I found my own home was offering the same temptations.
                                       My French Club pal, Katherine, always said she never thought of Mother's
                                       dwelling as a home but rather as a community. Mother herself, principal of
                                       the Komensky School, in addition to being the whole support of the family of
                                       five children from the time the youngest was four, was really the precursor
                                       of such developments as university extension giving art courses to her
                                       teachers during the years and decades, attended by many teachers from other
                                       schools and repeated in her home for the neighborhood on Saturdays, and
                                       undertaking to make livable quarters out of the barracks that our schools
                                       are (How could they be otherwise under the control of a political
                                       organization) which in her case she transformed into a real art gallery
                                       through loans made by friends usually becoming permanent, stained glass
                                       windows, etc. So that you never went through its halls without seeing
                                       children gazing here and there at some work of art, for here one found a
                                       statue and there the colored glow from a window or a whole story on the

                                       on Mother's family. One afternoon I was practicing on the piano when my
                                       brother Gerald came home. We nick-named him the "smiling telegraph pole"
                                       though his normal expression was serious as that of a judge. Not liking the
                                       sounds I was making, he ordered me to leave the piano. Naturally I didn't
                                       obey his instructions so he lifted me off the stool and put me on the other
                                       side of the room. Naturally again I immediately returned to the piano and
                                       after a second attempt

            <p><a name="d0e10550"></a>to settle me elsewhere returned and without looking at me caught me by the
                                       braids hanging down my back and hauled me unceremoniously across the room to
                                       the front door. On opening this to put me out he became aware of a shy
                                       stranger coming to mother's class and simply with a lift of his hand put me
                                       into an erect position and left me to deal with the situation. With my quite
                                       natural sweetness I greeted her and invited her to come in assuring her that
                                       Mother would be home at any moment, but she managed to find some excuse and
                                       disappeared never to return.

            <p><a name="d0e10553"></a>The home program was always a full one so it was usually impossible to change
                                       the day of the week for any function since every day was packed. In the
                                       daytime everyone left for a day's work but the spare time was filled full.
                                       There was not only the art class on Saturday afternoon and a general round
                                       up of friends of my sister, who was the belle of the neighborhood, on Sunday
                                       afternoons to stay for bread and coffee and on into the evening with songs
                                       and nonsense till Mother's alarm clock went off as a hint to the young folks
                                       that it was time to go home, which hint was as a rule not taken seriously.
                                       Monday would be filled with the rehearsals of the dramatic club which after
                                       a few years of presenting not too ambitious plays settled down to the study
                                       under Mr. Blake, and the presentation, for he insisted we never would give
                                       proper finish to a work without presenting it, of Shakespeare's plays which
                                       we carried on for the rest of the 15 years of our existence, some of our
                                       members graduating to the professional stage. I took part in this as I did
                                       in all the functions, the rest of the children being more choosey. So I had
                                       the fun of being Portia and Beatrice and Olivia and Cordelia and so on
                                       through the years.

            <p><a name="d0e10556"></a>Another evening would be given over to the little orchestral group, for Aunt
                                       Myra was a pianist who filled another evening too with a study group for
                                       listeners-in to the Saturday evening <a name="261"></a> [Note: Theodore] Thomas concerts.
                                       And another evening a group gathered for the study of poetry, Mr. Blake
                                       reading it, himself a master of English verse and a writer of plays.

            <p><a name="d0e10578"></a>One of the interesting things he did was a series of experiments in
                                       versification based on plotted mathematical curves. He would take the same
                                       motif and put it into some normal metric form and then put it into the
                                       geometrical form and, without telling which was which, have us express our
                                       preference. It was surprising how frequently we chose this new experiment.
                                       He and I had many a pleasant quatre d'heure in comparing our arts, mine
                                       being architecture. When either of us found a basic principle we passed it
                                       on to the other to find how it applied there. It was a great lesson to find
                                       how these discoveries could be applied to advantage in either art, in all
                                       the arts. All children should be brought up to express themselves in all the
                                       universal languages - the arts. It is no harder to learn them all than to
                                       learn one. The arts are play and they play into each other. They are lonely
                                       without the companionship of their fellows. Our ridiculous idea of experts
                                       these days is a deadly thing. Of course in the realm of time we may spend
                                       most of our time in one or another.

            <p><a name="d0e10581"></a>The oldest of the children was Jerome. The kernel of antagonism between him
                                       and myself may have started when Mrs. <a name="262"></a> [Note: Ella Flagg] Young, who was
                                       a bit of a tease, on one of her visits to Hubbard Woods flung an arithmetic
                                       problem at Jerome which he could not answer, quite likely because of a bit
                                       of stage fright, and she turned to me, listening in from across the room and
                                       said, "Well Marion can answer that," which I promptly did. One might say
                                       that Jerome was the immoral member of the family and perhaps I myself was
                                       the prude for our conflicts in later years were largely of such a nature.
                                       Jerome was brilliant and widely informed and I remember a New York friend
                                       dropping a line to Mother saying she wondered if Mother knew what a cultured
                                       gentleman her son was. I myself no matter how great the row had been could
                                       never resist, when Jerome came home from work, the temptation to slip down
                                       and sit on the stairs, when I was too angry to go near him, to listen to his
                                       sparkling account of the day for no matter how stodgy the office he

                                       adventure as seen through his eyes.

            <p><a name="d0e10595"></a>He was one of those Americans whose work, if the United States had been
                                       democratic instead of imperialistic in those days, would have gone a long
                                       way in this last half century toward establishing friendly relations and
                                       economic unity in the Americas. Our imperialism means that we are still
                                       under the domination of Rome, under the Spirit of Addition, interested only
                                       to get and get and never give whereas by now, with all the advantages
                                       America has had, we should be well under the influence of the Spirit of
                                       Subtraction, the impulse to give and give and never get. Really Jerome's
                                       impulse and abilities and trend in Mexico were of a colonizing nature. He
                                       and his wife were of those who would have aroused friendly feelings instead
                                       of enmity.

            <p><a name="d0e10598"></a>Instead of the Americans' helping, President <a name="263"></a> [Note: Woodrow] Wilson,
                                       awakened one night by some official urgency authorized (to his later regret)
                                       the sending of soldiers down to Vera Cruz. These American soldiers captured
                                       some scores of Mexicans, lined them up the next morning and shot them.
                                       Naturally this aroused feeling throughout Mexico and Jerome was one of those
                                       who were taken to prison. The personal feeling of those with whom he had
                                       been working and living was illustrated by one Mexican's pleading with the
                                       soldiers to take him instead, that Senor Mahony was a good man. But they
                                       threw him into prison and every day for about a week they brought him out,
                                       stood him against the wall to be shot and then sent him back to his cell,
                                       and finally released him. A strain to the nerves indeed but one could not
                                       blame the Mexicans but only deeply appreciate their having finally released
                                       him. The blame was of course America's.

                                       Americans and Mexicans, for the nature of economics if it is not supported

            <p><a name="d0e10626"></a>The mere fact of universal suffrage does not bring about democracy. Nor is it
                                       possible with the complications which we pile on our political organization
                                       to get anything in the nature of an intelligent expression from the people.
                                       Jerome remarked one day on the frequent statement that women didn't have
                                       enough brains to vote, saying that he went in once and looked up and down a
                                       long complicated list on the voting paper given to him and gave up trying to
                                       find what to do and never again went to a voting booth, his conclusion being
                                       that neither did men have enough intelligence to vote if intelligence was
                                       the thing called for. I myself have gone through life the same way. I went
                                       to vote once and realizing afterward what a foolish thing I had done never
                                       went back again till after I was 70 years of age.

                                       five years in Europe. They systemized their journey and spent about a year
                                       in each country during which Jerome concentrated on getting hold of the
                                       history of the country. When he returned he took an examination to teach in
                                       the evening school. He failed in the history examination. Naturally his
                                       answers were not the text book answers. He tried to get a job in Chicago,
                                       but the firms he went to wouldn't take him on because he was out of the
                                       country five years during which his life was not recorded by the official
                                       records. Nothing he could say or anyone else could say for him as to
                                       character and occupation during those years could make any difference. They
                                       simply wouldn't employ him. He started a factory in Minneapolis
                                           <a name="264"></a> [Note: Minnesota] which he carried on for several years

                                       employer than for the employee. After having sunk considerable funds he gave
                                       it up and started out with a quarter of a dollar in his pocket and beat his
                                       way across to Montana. He "rode the rods <a name="265"></a> [Note: rails?]" under the
                                           <a name="266"></a> [Note: railroad] cars and earned his way picking up odd jobs here
                                       and there when he could. More than once he went for more than seven days
                                       without food. He said that after the second day you don't mind it. One of
                                       the most trying situations he ever had to face was when a companion he was
                                       on good terms with suggested a partnership and explained the nature of his
                                       business which was stealing, and showed him his apparatus to safeguard
                                       himself in case of emergency. That, Jerome insisted, took more tact than any
                                       other situation he ever had to face since he really had to convince the man
                                       that he was one of his own kind and that there was no danger of Jerome's
                                       giving him away.

            <p><a name="d0e10649"></a>Arriving in Montana, he got a job as cow-boy on a ranch and later established
                                       himself on a ranch of his own. One of his heart breaks was the upsetting of
                                       the boat in the turbulent river in going to this new ranch and not being
                                       able to recover his violin which for so many years had been his boon
                                       companion. Circumstances brought him back to Chicago some years later and
                                       his next adventure took him down into Mexico.

                                       only first cousin Dwight <a name="267"></a> [Note: Perkins], a few years older than
                                       Jerome, was with us much of the time. It was in his office that I had my
                                       first architectural experience. Many years later he remarked that it seemed
                                       odd to him that he had never known me, the most Bohemian person he had ever

                                       seemed to be something irreconcilable about this. In my business
                                       partnerships I had at times traveled with my partner. Questioning the
                                       propriety had never entered anyone's head. It was one of the natural things
                                       that have succeeded in establishing wholesome relations between man and
                                       woman in America.

            <p><a name="d0e10674"></a>The adventuresome nature of the typical American was expressed in one of the
                                       events of the Hubbard Woods summer vacations. The two younger boys, Gerald
                                       and Leslie fourteen and ten years of age, packed a lunch early one morning
                                       and went off to the lake. They had made up their minds to build a raft. With
                                       this constructed before the morning was over they ate their bit of lunch and
                                       started to paddle around on their raft. It was not long before they were
                                       caught in one of those occasional currents of Lake Michigan and, paddle as
                                       they would, they couldn't get back to shore. They passed one pleasure boat
                                       the voices from which they could distinctly hear and called out to them for
                                       help but no one paid any attention to them. Naturally, we felt afterwards
                                       that anyone seeing small boys so far out should have brought them in even
                                       without their asking for help.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10677"></a>Toward evening Mother went down to the shore but not finding the boys assumed
                                       they were somewhere around in the woods. However as the twilight deepened
                                       into darkness she became very anxious and the neighbors gradually gathered
                                       to spend the night out in the storm which had arisen, searching the woods
                                       having at times that curious experience of walking in circles. The next day
                                       the word went far and wide. Friends came out from the city, among them Mrs.
                                       Young <a name="268"></a> [Note: Ella Flagg Young?]. I remember that when it had occurred
                                       to her that the boys might have been picked up by some boat going into
                                       Chicago, I went up with her to run ahead to hold the train about due so that
                                       no time should be lost in following up this possible clue. I set her a pace
                                       indeed and when I tackled the conductor telling him he must hold the train
                                       which he said he couldn't do, my breathlessness helped my commanding will
                                       and he waited until Mrs. Young, scarcely able to breath, climbed onto the
                                       train. She went to John R. Walsh who proceeded to get in touch with the
                                       various boats for it was the 4th of July and no boats were coming in or
                                       going out.

            <p><a name="d0e10683"></a>The afternoon was drawing to a close when the men told me to persuade Mother
                                       to leave the Lake shore so they could drag the Lake.

            <p><a name="d0e10691"></a>We had of course been telegraphing far and wide and as Mother mounted the
                                       steps of the station platform a telegram came through saying the boys were
                                       found.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10694"></a>When Jerome had gone down to the Lake there was a bit of a board raft on the
                                       sand which he had kicked contemptuously aside saying the boys would never
                                       have tried to go out on a thing like that. In fact they had worked well on
                                       the raft they had made having nailed four logs securely and this bit of a
                                       sieve had weathered the storm all through the night, the storm which the
                                       boat captains said no small craft could possibly live through. It was so
                                       dark that Gerald had to keep reaching out his hand to feel if Leslie was
                                       still there. A huge vessel almost ran them down but their screams of terror
                                       were not heard and the ship went on its way. In the morning they were so far
                                       out they could not see any land so had to wait till the sun rose to know
                                       which way to paddle. They had hung onto their paddles so as dawn came, in
                                       spite of their exhaustion, they paddled in finally reaching the shore. They
                                       started to walk but when they spoke to a man he wouldn't believe them when
                                       they said they had come from Hubbard Woods twelve miles away and went on his
                                       way leaving them to get along as best they could.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10697"></a>They would walk for a while then sleep for a while. They passed through a
                                       picnic group and asked for something to eat but nobody paid any attention to
                                       them. They went on and Leslie who seems to have an inborn genius for finding
                                       money found a penny and they went into a shop and bought the biggest thing
                                       they could buy for a penny. It took them nine hours to make the first six
                                       miles, half the way home when, as they were passing a railroad station, the
                                       agent spoke to them to see if by chance they were the missing boys. They
                                       were packed on the next train for home. So frightfully sunburned were they
                                       that a touch was agony and that first night Leslie ran a bit of a
                                       temperature. But two days later a friend came out from town to see the boys
                                       and couldn't believe his ears when Mother greeted him telling him the boys
                                       were not in, they had gone down to the lake.

            <p><a name="d0e10716"></a>Gerald, 6 foot 3 inches tall, who was the engineer of the family, worked his
                                       way through college - the Armour Institute <a name="269"></a> [Note: of Technology,
                                       Chicago]. He belonged to those fortunate days before high finance,
                                       when banking business was run on some such lines as would be universal if
                                       there were an Abilities Organization. So he was able to get financing on
                                       purely personal credit, no security, to run a factory. Later he spent some
                                       years in the making of transformers in one of the towns on the St. Joe
                                           <a name="270"></a> [Note: St. Joseph] river. Getting homesick he bargained with his
                                       domestic sister, Georgine, to keep house for him if he bought a home. Some
                                       time passed and she had begun a course of training as a nurse when a
                                       telegram came up, "If I buy a house will you come down." She couldn't very
                                       well drop her work off hand so I feeling ready for a holiday from drafting
                                       telegraphed - "Gene can't but I will if you'll have a piano as well."
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e10725"></a>Everybody was filled with consternation when they found Gerald was to be in
                                       the hands of a professional woman instead of his sister Georgine. They were
                                       sure he would starve to death. That was in the early days of women in the
                                       professions when such ideas were prevalent. I suggested to Gerald that of
                                       course he couldn't expect to be provided with a dinner when genius was
                                       burning, but he was ready to accept any proposition I made for he had gotten
                                       his eye on an old, left over farm house which the town had grown up to and
                                       around and which was right on the bank of the St. Joe river, and the bank of
                                       the Elkhart river just across the street in front. The friend with whom he
                                       had been boarding suggested a carpenter he ought to consult to get advice
                                       about fixing up the house. He replied that his sister was an architect and
                                       would do that, to which she replied, "Oh but she won't know about Elkhart
                                           <a name="271"></a> [Note: Indiana] ways." Sometimes perhaps he thought he would have
                                       been less exploited in the carpenter's hands for he always insisted that I
                                       ruined him. But such fun as we both had! A big brick fire place in the
                                       living room with odds and ends of architectural modeled plaster work built
                                       into it. Before the scaffolding was out, though it was a hot day, we crept
                                       in under to build a fire and sat there hugging our

                                       use was being made of the attic space. Always a space saver Griffin took
                                       this space for his office.

                                       grows. He and a number of the young Chicago School of Architecture had
                                       already made similar use of the attic space in Steinway Hall building of
                                       Dwight Perkins. A considerable number of the young Chicago School moved in

                                       died before the work could be initiated. This was Griffin's first plan of a

                                       over another ell made a sumptuous studio room; and the huge old fashioned
                                       barn picked up, moved over and dropped down over the riverbank formed a
                                       boathouse below with the whole huge hayloft above converted into a screened

                                       It served for community life in Elkhart somewhat on the lines of Mother's

            <p><a name="d0e10796"></a>I found the children bathing in this dangerous river with those wicked little
                                       water wings and taught them all how to swim. Here I had a chance to teach
                                       all my married friends how not to keep house, but really to live. Here in
                                       the hay-loft Rachel and I rehearsed and painted the scenery - Florence as
                                       seen from the heights of San Miniato, and disgusted Gerald by ripping off
                                       the side steps of the house to aid our imaginations in the balcony scene of
                                       Alfred de Musset's play which had been presented in Paris by Sarah Bernhardt
                                       and Agar <a name="280"></a> [Note: Leonide Charvin Agar?]. I did the strolling minstrel
                                       and learned how to thrum the guitar for this special occasion. Mr. Blake had
                                       translated it for us into beautiful American verse. Later on we transported
                                       the scenery to present the play in Chicago.

                                       Tierra Caliente of Mexico to erect a sugar mill and to carry on with the
                                       management for some years. This again is an instance of years wasted for
                                       lack of an Economic Organization for this splendid business on an ideal

                                       states. The Elkhart house was closed for a while but afterwards for many
                                       years served as the ancestral homestead for the family for vacations and a
                                       place to which we could fly with the children for country air. My niece,

                                       other familiars never tried the house doors first but always came around to
                                       the river bank fairly sure to find us there. Later, after his marriage, this
                                       treasured place became Gerald's home again and still is.

                                       mother's favorite pastimes was reading the wills in the papers and she
                                       always got herself insured when traveling and every time made a new will
                                       having great fun apportioning this manufactured inheritance. She wrote me
                                       she had willed one of her houses to Georgine and the Elkhart one to me. At

                                       estates for which end the Haven estate was very important, so I wrote her
                                       that since she wasn't using the house I would greatly appreciate it if she
                                       would sell it and send me the money instead of willing it to me. Learning of

                                       which met all sorts of needs. Gerald having bought the place twice over was
                                       again able to occupy it himself.

                                       Gerald's plantation being near the Gulf and Jerome's near the Pacific Ocean.
                                       Gerald too was one of the outside plantation managers who would never carry
                                       a gun though there were 700 men on the plantation, half Mexican and half
                                       Chinese. The boys had at that time made the journey from Puerto Mexico to
                                       Salina Cruz, bathing in the two waters on the same day. Here is where the

                                       Freeman <a name="283"></a> [Note: periodical title]. Though no name was used I found
                                       myself reading about this brother Jerome of mine. The writer had found
                                       himself in this remote and isolated region - in Tehuantepec - waiting for
                                       hours at a little railroad station and was so excited to have encountered
                                       here "one of the most interesting men" he had ever met that he made an
                                       article of it and here I was on the other side of the world making
                                       connection with my family anew. The world is not so big. It won't be
                                       difficult to make a unit of it so long as we don't expect different groups
                                       to have the same moral standards, nor individuality to be eliminated. Let's
                                       wipe out the "Prince of the World" idea and realize that it is nonsense to
                                       think of any of the European communities as democracies.

            <p><a name="d0e10839"></a>My sister Georgine was obliged to give up her undertaking of being a nurse
                                       because of a heart difficulty which perhaps had resulted as the outcome of
                                       acute attacks of rheumatism through her childhood. Doctors pronounced it a
                                       leaking valve and incurable saying she probably could not live through her
                                       teens and it would not be possible for her to live to the age of thirty,
                                       that she must be very quiet putting no strain on her heart. Her response was
                                       to dance and run and climb, for in those romantic years death had no terror
                                       but rather a romantic appeal. She did however go on a unique diet which may
                                       have caused Mother some anxiety in those days which feared the foods we now

                                       to do with the meals set before the family. I am inclined to attribute to
                                       this as well as to her spirit the fact that all the signs of her physical
                                       disability disappeared and when in her fifties these doctors saw her, they
                                       asked to be permitted to listen to her heart and found that the leak had
                                       disappeared. However she went into teaching instead of nursing and like her
                                       Mother before and her daughter after her, was a genius in this realm. Her
                                       experience in nursing was of value to herself and her friends. She was one
                                       of those who functioned and was looked upon as an angel by those who came
                                       into her environment though, as Mother said, in her girlhood she could make
                                       the Angel Gabriel angry if she wanted to.

            <p><a name="d0e10850"></a>Leslie was the babe of the family and didn't have a fair start because with
                                       Father's death he was put into school at four years of age so that, since
                                       this was before kindergarten days, he got the intellectual work so
                                       destructive to the body if prematurely used. These etheric life forces up to
                                       the sixth year of age are required for building up and establishing the
                                       physical body. If they are diverted, before the change of teeth, to head
                                       work which is their natural field from that time on, they leave the physical
                                       body depleted for the rest of one's life. So Leslie was too thin and short
                                       of vital forces all his life but so far as success, as generally understood,
                                       is concerned he was the one who attained it. As a youngster he had taken
                                       great satisfaction in the fact that he, as he said, had "friends among the
                                       rich and the poor." That faculty served him well and as manager of the sales
                                       Department of Explosives he broke the record of the du Pont Company in spite
                                       of the fact that depression came during his term of office.

                                       to do physically what none of her teachers could do - go from the top of one
                                       of her four story buildings down to the first floor and up to the fourth
                                       floor of the other building and address a class without stopping to catch
                                       her breath. She resigned against the wish of her teachers about half of whom
                                       were so disgusted with the principal who succeeded her <a name="284"></a> [Note: "a man"

            <p><a name="d0e10867"></a>There is a requirement in Chicago that the principal and superintendents mark
                                       the teachers. A new superintendent learning that Mother always marked all
                                       her teachers 100 in everything said that was insubordination, a defiance of
                                       the system. Gossip brought this to Mother's ears and she tossed her head
                                       saying he was welcome to visit her school any time he chose. When he did
                                       come she let him go from room to room making his own choice. By the time he
                                       had visited three he could keep quiet no longer but said he had never heard
                                       such work in his life. All the school work was on exceptionally high
                                       standards but as it happened he was a singing superintendent and Mother's
                                       school was in the Bohemian district, the children when they entered not
                                       being able to speak English, her teachers were mostly Bohemians and
                                       consequently they and the children were practically all musicians. With part
                                       singing of lovely music it was no wonder that he was astonished. Mother
                                       never heard any more complaints about her marks of her teachers.

            <p><a name="d0e10870"></a>In our youth a charcoal drawing of my Aunt Myra's hung on the wall, a

                                       was grown up did I learn that it was Beatrice Cenci. I was interested years
                                       later in a confirmation of this resemblance. An Italian draftsman in the
                                       office once came to me a bit mysteriously and asked if I knew Beatrice
                                       Cenci. I said, "Yes." He said, "You like her?" I said, "Yes, I think she was
                                       very beautiful." "You have the same outline," he said, "You have the same
                                       outline." I had been prepared not to give too much weight to that remark by

                                       emigration of Americans to all parts of the world. The meaning of the word
                                       is practically unknown elsewhere. To build this arch requires the two
                                       foundation stones of Equity and Mutuality - i.e., democracy in the Political
                                       Realm and fraternity in the Economic realm. It calls for the development of
                                       every individual's ability throughout the world. It is the opposite of
                                       imperialism and is well expressed in Mr. <a name="286"></a> [Note: President Harry S.]
                                       Truman's great speech in Berlin of 20 July 1945 - where he spoke of "a
                                       better world, a peaceful world, a world in which all people will have the
                                       opportunity to enjoy the good things of life - and not just a few at the
                                       top." He said, "Let us not forget that we are fighting for peace and for the
                                       welfare of mankind. We are not fighting for conquest. There is not one piece
                                       of territory nor one thing of a monetary nature that we want out of this
                                       war. We want peace and prosperity for the world as a whole. We want to see
                                       the time come when we can do the things in peace that we have been able to
                                       do in war. If we can put this tremendous machine of ours, which has made
                                       victory possible, to work for peace, we can look forward to the greatest age
                                       in the history of mankind. That is what we propose to do."

                                       explain that I have arranged to remit those funds from here. (Which he did.
                                       MMG) If the present deal goes clear over I shall be relieved in many
                                       directions. I will have a splendid start for further operations and would be
                                       really quite well off if I stopped and simply farmed the finca

                                       afraid I was not, then they thought I was a bluffer, now they have for a
                                       moment, definitely made up their minds that I am a millionaire. This carries
                                       with it the punishment that is meted to millionaires and reputed

                                       and one's difficulties increase as the operations get further extended. So
                                       for the present I shall simply do all I can on the ones I have started on
                                       and commence turning the land into cash a little later on. <a name="288"></a> [Note: the phrase

                                       him in amazement as she did for the rest of their lives. He hadn't in the

                                       adventure, kept him from taking these discoveries and constructing from them
                                       a most lovely thing to bring into the consciousness of his community to
                                       develop and to add to the glories of his native city - a community plan for

            <p><a name="d0e11123"></a>Xanthippe's business arrangement with her architectural partner was that she
                                       should have complete control of design. Thus it was recognized that creative
                                       work can spring from one mind only who must have full authority and final
                                       decision in all matters of design and construction. The arrangement worked
                                       very well but was not the complete and logical one that was later developed
                                       in the office of Socrates. For indeed it would usually be necessary for the
                                       designer to have the contact with the client to be able to mold his mind in
                                       the give and take so necessary in the solution of a problem where the client
                                       always wants more than he wants to pay for.

                                       when she leaped at a draftsman and said, "Oh, you naughty little thing. You
                                       have done that wrong," where he would have cursed and fumed. But her method
                                       was effective where his would probably have failed except on the surface.
                                       For all the draftsmen young and old were most painstaking and untiring in
                                       their work. In fact many times she told the younger ones not to work too
                                       hard, that the important thing was to keep themselves alive and wide awake.
                                       Many years later she learned in very truth how this is the essential
                                       requirement in entering the whole realm of spiritual realities, to become in
                                       fact an independent and creative being, to enter the supersensible with
                                       fully alive and wide awake self-consciousness instead of trying to penetrate
                                       it by trance or medium or blindly not knowing what one is doing nor how. By
                                       these fully conscious methods the doors to genius are open to every human

                                       dropped their canoe into the Chicago River at the Van Buren street bridge.
                                       The canoe was taken by their loving hands and launched at the point nearest
                                       to the station where it arrived from the East and then and there its journey
                                       began which was to last in weekly installments through the succeeding years,
                                       never retracing its steps, till the misfortune of fame called them to far
                                       distant parts. Allana they named the beautiful creature - Allana - Beloved -
                                       and she was left high and dry on the shores of Lake Michigan where their

                                       afternoon and Sunday. Xanthippe had expected to start on Sunday because that
                                       would give them a whole day for the outing. But waste a half a day when
                                       Allana was there on the water and waiting! Such a thought was intolerable to
                                       the logical mind of Socrates and we must remember logic started in humanity
                                       with Socrates. How could so frail a thing as Xanthippe - and she was frail -
                                       stop the most powerful force that had yet come to human beings in the long,
                                       long course of their development. Not yet was she aware of the still more
                                       powerful force that is developing in this new century. Well she couldn't and
                                       so through their lives logic won in the battle royal between Socrates and
                                       Xanthippe even to the taking of the hemlock.

                                       out, at the southern end of Lake Michigan with radiating streams from the
                                       surrounding districts pouring their waters into it, and such a system of
                                       radiating and belt lines of railroad as is to be found nowhere else. For

                                       necessary for farmers to leave strips of forest along the river banks or
                                       their land gets worn away and acres may be lost. So many times they paddled
                                       for days with no consciousness of mankind. What a blessed relief! Only
                                       Socrates and Xanthippe. Of course she came to seem a part of the wonders of
                                       creation to him. And of course all other humans were simply humans.

            <p><a name="d0e11226"></a>As Sunday drew to a close and train had to be caught back to the city
                                       Socrates, in passing through a small town, chose a house on the river bank
                                       and asked if the canoe could be left there till the following week-end.
                                       Thereupon began their universal (with one exception) experience with the
                                       sweetness of human nature, for throughout the three years of this adventure
                                       whomsoever they asked whether farmer or summer-house occupant or bridge
                                       tender, whether in poor or comfortable circumstances, no one ever refused to
                                       take Allana in and care for her and sometimes it meant real trouble. Once a
                                       storm arose and the rising waters started her off on a jaunt of her own, but
                                       she was brought back. Sometimes as the cold season approached, they would
                                       say they expected to be back the next week-end and then the winter ice would
                                       close the stream and she would stay till Spring. And there after months they
                                       would find her. And no one would ever accept any compensation for this
                                       service. The one refusal was from an Institution well fitted to give her
                                       shelter - the Naval Quarters on the shore of Lake Michigan. They were sent
                                       from subordinate to higher up and so on to still higher ups and refused and
                                       they, on the lake where a canoe is not really safe even under the best
                                       circumstances, were sent out into the blackness of the night. They have been
                                       pacifists ever since. Militarism breeds beasts not humans. No one else was
                                       ever inhuman to Allana.

            <p><a name="d0e11256"></a>haired" (so called by my 5 year old niece) blond of a Socrates was gradually
                                       capturing her imagination. So one day, after they had got a cart to carry
                                       Allana over to the head waters of the Fox River and had dropped her into the
                                       waters of Grass Lake just when the great creamy yellow Egyptian lotus
                                       flowers were in bloom and stretching as far as the eye could reach
                                       (Socrates' Daemon would always land him at such a spot at the very right
                                       moment) they slipped along, so soft, so still, through the huge lotus leaves
                                       without even a sound (so close were the pads) of the drip from the paddles
                                       to frighten the birds away. And so near they let them come! Only three
                                       places in America where these grow, brought in some mysterious way by some
                                       people of the remote past from where? Perhaps from Atlantis from whence the
                                       Egyptians also might have taken them. So this landscape architect told her,
                                       who knew the flora of his country from a to zed as they say in the
                                       antipodes.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11259"></a>Afterward they got into the roaring rapids of the lower reaches where
                                       Xanthippe in the prow had hung in the air over a three foot drop shouting
                                       back, "We can't go here! We can't go here!" only to hear from the stern -
                                       "We've got to." And after waking very early in the cold morning to slip on
                                       down toward the Illinois, they watched veil after veil of the mists rise
                                       from the bluffed and forested banks, each veil as it rose revealing a new
                                       and ever more beautiful universe. Indeed the way to God, the Father God, is
                                       through a close and intimate contact with nature. What hope is there for our
                                       city-bred people. What does <a name="305"></a> [Note: Rudolf] Steiner say, not a

                                       Einstein's with his talk about a cylindrical universe, but that there are as
                                       many universes as there are crystalline forms. A crystalline form is a
                                       primal work of a deity - a Primal force which cannot but express itself in a
                                       universe of consequences. And so after a rest on a sunny bank while he took
                                       a dip in the refreshing stream, Xanthippe said, "Why don't I join you in
                                       your office?" for Xanthippe was well known for her renderings, her
                                       presentation work, and the work of Socrates was lying hidden away known only

                                       office where she had worked before, when Socrates, the Town Planner, had
                                       gone into partnership with Frank <a name="310"></a> [Note: Lloyd] Wright, beginning to
                                       realize what has become clear beyond question as time has gone on, that
                                       architecture cannot be practiced properly unless based on the foundation of
                                       Town Planning. Just as Town Planning without Architecture becomes nothing
                                       but real estate business squeezing the life out of the earth, so
                                       architecture when not combined with Town Planning in the same individual
                                       cannot solve the problems of architecture.

            <p><a name="d0e11315"></a>And now on coming into his office she had revelation after revelation, thrill
                                       after thrill. Problems which she had seen struggled over in office after
                                       office and never solved were being solved one after another. Inspiration,
                                       the source of information, had been tapped and she watched Socrates as
                                       Xanthippe always watches Socrates with awe and amazement and understanding.
                                       Perhaps the fools would understand Mrs. Abraham Lincoln better if they had
                                       the wit to realize that true love is not based on friendly feelings but on
                                       feelings "more closely related to enmity." It is time we got rid of this
                                       sloppy stuff about marriage.

                                       phrase - "All the world is beautiful and only man is vile." For from the
                                       wonder and perfection of the natural stream they passed to town after town
                                       in this industrial region incredibly sordid, with the waters thick with the
                                       poisonous by-products of the mills, where it would have been the easiest
                                       thing in the world to have kept the river and its banks as permanent
                                       playgrounds for the growing communities. Was ever any civilization so
                                       stupid, so barbarous?

                                       out in the bottom and snooze; then up and paddle again. But Socrates would
                                       never stop. He never would at any time save by some insuperable force of
                                       nature or by the force of Xanthippe. 'Twas so in the office where his great
                                       ideal was to break Xanthippe of her homing habit. Always one more thing
                                       could be done or a still lovelier spot for landing could be found a little
                                       farther on. One night paddling up a swampy stream in flood time the moon
                                       rose and the moon set but still Socrates paddled on, and wonderful it was if
                                       you had the strength left sufficient for the registering of the perceptive
                                       faculties. Continuous rain set in and sang songs with the drip and drip of
                                       the paddle. Finally in the pitch dark they turned in to a group of trees for

                                       see if there was any ground finally decided there was a bit, pulled Allana
                                       up on it and went to sleep in the canoe. Socrates himself thought the land
                                       would probably disappear with the rising waters and that such sound sleepers
                                       would be safer in the canoe. So they spread their rubber blankets over the
                                       canoe, it took the two to reach from end to end, and went to sleep.

                                       people on a cold night sleeping in a bath tub with the plug in and the water
                                       turned on, for the weight of the rain gradually depressed the blankets to
                                       form a reservoir and the crack in the middle formed a perfect outlet from
                                       the reservoir into the canoe. Needless to say they were on their way early
                                       in the morning, slipping up the first canal to a farm house where they left
                                       Allana and in their sopping wet clothes walked ten miles to the nearest
                                       railway station and so home and on to the office. One learns from a

                                       This like most diseases is the consequence of living in houses. No pleasure,

                                       are from five years of age, or from birth, to the day of our death.

                                       become full of significance. When Socrates was a little fellow in school,
                                       and he was smaller than the average (These short men have the advantage they
                                       say since as a pumping machine the heart doesn't have anything like the task
                                       it has in the long fellows) he quite consciously made up his mind that when
                                       the older boys teased him he would make no sign, on the theory that if he
                                       didn't cry they would find no fun in it; and so it was. They soon left him
                                       alone. Fine discipline for the punishments he was to receive in his fight
                                       against the inertia of his time, especially in bureaucratic

                                       this was instanced by the demand on his part when he went to the Illinois
                                       university for a course in Town Planning, for no University in the world
                                       would offered such a course at that time. The basic religion of Town
                                       Planning requires the preservation of natural beauties, a respect for the
                                       works of the creator. Its practice at present entails perpetual fight with
                                       all the elements of the community. The weeks slipped by and the months
                                       slipped by and nothing was done about that competition. But on with the tale
                                       of Allana.

            <p><a name="d0e11415"></a>What an experience that 45 mile spurt was! Going up a bit of a stream
                                       Xanthippe, eagerly absorbing all delights that were offering, for she was of
                                       a sanguine temperament, ecstatic in her enjoyment of all lovely and gracious
                                       things, with head bent low between her arms, pulling with all her strength
                                       for they were in a current so swift that they could scarcely make progress
                                       against it, called, "Oh, look at the myriads of gastropods <a name="315"></a> [Note: i.e.,
                                           mollusks, snails] on the logs on the bottom." "Don't look," said
                                       Socrates, "Paddle!" "But I've got to look," said Xanthippe, "They are so
                                       darling." "Provoking person!" said Socrates. And those are the harshest
                                       words he ever said to her. Once years after, she said, I'm like Ben Bolt's
                                       Alice. I laugh with delight when you give me a smile and tremble with fear
                                       at your frown." And he said, "Did I ever frown at you?" and with a still
                                       amazement this provoking person said, "By Jove I don't believe you ever
                                       did."

                                       to lighten the load so that Allana could slip over the surface waters. A
                                       municipal gas plant, taking the privileges bureaucracies will take that
                                       would not be tolerated from a private organization, had let its waste
                                       material flow into the stream, a black, sticky mass and such a waste of
                                       byproducts, again typically bureaucratic, and soon they found that they
                                       couldn't really clean their legs so that when

                                       exposed to a blistering sun. The consequences later - Oh! let them be
                                       forgotten! They were now at the very southern toe of Lake Michigan but no
                                       rest was to be till Socrates had reached his predetermined goal, a group of
                                       camping hikers on the shore at the Dunes where late in the evening they
                                       arrived.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11435"></a>This was the organization founded by eight or ten young seers, one of them
                                       Socrates, another Xanthippe's only first cousin, Dwight Perkins, which
                                       interested rapidly increasing number to take long and ever longer hikes over
                                       the region surrounding Chicago, and later over the State, always under
                                       strict discipline to injure nothing and to pick not even a leaf; and under
                                       informed leaders to discover and inspect and select the beauty spots and to
                                       press for their resumption by Chicago or the State for permanent public play
                                       spaces and beauty reserves. Thus Chicago achieved the finest outer park
                                       system in the world. The work even overlapped into two states getting
                                       Illinois and Indiana to join in saving the unique and lovely dunes which
                                       were rapidly not only being occupied but destroyed by using the sand for
                                       concrete and other structural purposes. After this was stopped it proved
                                       just as easy, probably easier, for great sand suckers to get all that could
                                       be wanted from the bottom of the lake.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11438"></a>The next day was the hottest any of them had ever experienced, the sand as
                                       hot as the top of a stove, and they all spent the whole day in the water
                                       even eating their meals there, getting out just to snatch a handful of food
                                       and scurrying back to eat it with only hands and heads above water.

                                       advisers, of whom Xanthippe was unconscious at the time, that said to her -
                                       "We can't do anything with that Socrates without some human help. Won't you

                                       Devil himself as Socrates was later inclined to think; anyway the storm of
                                       wrath broke over his head on some such lines as follows:- "For the love of
                                       Mike when are you going to get started on those Capital plans? How much time
                                       do you think there is left anyway? Do you realize that it takes a solid
                                       month to get them over there after they have started on their way? That
                                       leaves exactly 9 weeks now to turn them out in. Perhaps you can design a
                                       city in two days but the drawings take time and that falls on me. Five
                                       weeks! It isn't possible to do them in nine weeks. Perhaps I am the swiftest
                                       draftsman in town but I can't do the impossible. What's the use of thinking
                                       about a thing like this for ten years if when the time comes you don't get
                                       it done in time! Mark my words and I'm not joking either, either you get
                                       busy on that this very day, this very minute (with rising tones) or I'll not
                                       touch a pencil to the darn things. Serve you jolly well right if I refused
                                       to take it on now." (No, not jolly. Such language only came later.)

            <p><a name="d0e11481"></a>I had just entered into partnership with Griffin when Mr. <a name="317"></a> [Note: Joshua
                                       G.] Melson, who with Mr. <a name="318"></a> [Note: James E.] Blythe had recently
                                       bought a bit of Mason City <a name="319"></a> [Note: Iowa] property through which a river
                                       flowed, came to me to design a house for him.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11493"></a>This unoccupied stretch of land lies on either side of the river close to the
                                       down town district of Mason City. Mr. Melson, looking quite melancholy when
                                       he came to me, had had a dream and it wasn't coming true. He had asked
                                           <a name="320"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright to design a house for him but Wright had
                                       no Town Planning sense and had designed just a house to set by the roadside.
                                       So the poet in Mr. Melson wasn't satisfied. He came to me. You know I had a
                                       romantic look.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11499"></a>But instead of taking up his suggestion I told him that this was a Town
                                       Planning undertaking and suggested he talk it over with Walter Burley
                                       Griffin which he did on the site and was taken off his feet with the
                                       suggestions made for the general layout and for a dwelling for himself
                                       carrying up an old quarry wall to form one wall of his home.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11502"></a>In addition Griffin suggested an artificial precipice by encouraging the city
                                       to dump rubbish under quite a stretch of the bridge and facing it with the
                                       local stone thus adding 3 building lots whose outlook would rake up the
                                       river, and so on.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11505"></a>When Mr. Melson's home was finished Griffin himself climbed up the wall from
                                       river bottom to roof. The house is a lovely blossom in the natural terraces
                                       of the river bank, with a secret afternoon-tea terrace on the level of the
                                       floor of the billiard room accessible only from it.

            <p><a name="d0e11516"></a>He was known as Don Melancholio. He got sketches for his home from one
                                       architect after another, including F.L.W. <a name="321"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright],
                                       but nothing satisfied him though one at least was charming enough as plans
                                       go. But still he wandered on.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11522"></a>At about this time I had settled myself in the office of Walter Burley
                                       Griffin. One day the Don came in and asked me if I would make him sketches
                                       for his house. I begged off saying Mr. Griffin's office was pressed with
                                       work and I felt in fairness to him I couldn't take time off for other work.
                                       Then he revealed his problem. He and Mr. Blythe of Mason City had bought 18
                                       acres on the banks of the river in their home town and would I make a
                                       perspective drawing of it.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11525"></a>The spark caught and I said I thought I could do that but if it was a
                                       landscape scheme he ought to talk with Mr. Griffin about it, and I showed
                                       him some of Griffin's houses, etc. He had a talk, had Griffin go down to
                                       Mason City for a day at the end of which the two gentlemen signed away their
                                       so-called liberties in a contract which bound each of them to do nothing on
                                       the property without Mr. Griffin's approval.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11528"></a>The two men had bought this property because they thought it a lovely spot
                                       for a home. The rest of the river frontage had been ruined. Below was a
                                       miserable factory, above a rubbish dump. The banker and the business man
                                       then put off and put off building each mistrusting what the other might do.
                                       To such impasses does this fetish of personal liberty, misplaced liberty,
                                       lead us in our chaotically conceived social system which refuses to
                                       recognize that a human community has three functions to fulfill and so
                                       requires three complete community organs to fulfill them, one for equity,
                                       one for liberty and one for mutuality, a political, an ability &amp; an
                                       economic organ each consisting of the total citizenry. The Town Planner
                                       would be an impartial arbitrator whose only personal interest would be to
                                       maintain the high standard of the whole property.

                                       our Don, in his pocket. The other architects had handled the house simply
                                       from the architect's point of view locating it at the normal building line
                                       distance from the street frontage, but Griffin as soon as the house was
                                       mentioned inspected the property to select a particular lot and advised an
                                       abandoned quarry site on the river bank and drew a picture in Mr. Melson's
                                       mind of a house perched at the extreme back of the lot on top of the quarry
                                       precipice, continuing and giving finish to the quarry face, and commanding
                                       views up and down the river. Melancholy flew out and an enduring enthusiasm
                                       filled its place in our Don. Only once did it seem for a moment to have
                                       returned when the old "sad face" appeared in the office saying he was going
                                       to have to charge up his electric light bills to Mr. Griffin for - and then
                                       the smile crinkles began - everyone, and that was the whole town, who
                                       crossed the bridge - which connects "down town" with the residence district
                                       - whether pedestrian or motorist stopped to look up the river at the
                                       fascinating sight of Rock Crest's initial building - a castle indeed for it
                                       was a unity with the whole precipice - completely reflected in the smooth
                                       waters above the old dam; and he couldn't resist the temptation of keeping
                                       his whole house lighted up to make the most of a spectacle of it.

                                       gentle wooded slope, charming and gracious, extending from the house to the
                                       river, a complete contrast to Mr. Melson's site.

                                       and rather than interfere with the men of vision in whose hands the whole
                                       would be better safeguarded than in the hands of the officials, instead of
                                       using their right of eminent domain they would perhaps take on the
                                       restitution of other parts of the river frontage, perhaps converting the

                                       Willow Creek has carved out of the rocks within 3 blocks of the central
                                       square of Mason City, Iowa. In common with many such beautiful pieces of
                                       nature it has been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of
                                       the commonplace sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems to be
                                       approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently stimulated by
                                       opportunity for unique development in those instances where long abuse has
                                       not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the neglect. This
                                       example comprises 18 acres of the creek frontage between two bridges. That
                                       at the north is a permanent masonry arch carrying an important thoroughfare
                                       route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but the western
                                       footbridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in the near
                                       future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream of a
                                       territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression to be
                                       preserved and respected.

            <p><a name="d0e11609"></a>The vertical bluffs of Willow Creek alternate from side to side of its
                                       sinuous course. In the portion illustrated they comprise the south and west
                                       banks, opposed by a gentle slope of meadow and open woods extending
                                       gradually up to almost equal elevation north and west within the limits of
                                       the tract. Wherever this rise has been less than that naturally, it has been
                                       augmented artificially by grading and filling to form a commanding hill at
                                       the north-east corner with lesser mounds and ravines masking the south

                                       drawings of the general layout of future buildings and a key design for the
                                       building groups for the University of New Mexico. He was very interested in
                                       and sympathetic with the pueblo motif they were then using. Unfortunately
                                       his young assistant <a name="324"></a> [Note: Barry Byrne] in Chicago in whose charge the

                                       so-called Chicago movement in architecture, not to forward these drawings
                                       but to send down his own design for the building they were about to erect.

            <p><a name="d0e11680"></a>In entering my second office I was graduated from pure drafting to experience
                                       and began to function in my first stage of design in a realm fairly natural
                                       to me, that of the art of the painter. Not till years later was I to learn
                                       the radical difference between the art of painting and the art of
                                       architecture. Painting and sculpture are depictive arts sculpture to be sure
                                       including a sense of movement. But architecture is a spatial, a structural,
                                       art and requires a quite different impulse and type of comprehension.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11683"></a>In this second office, that of F.L. <a name="326"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright, we were,
                                       to be sure, practicing as architects but were really functioning as artists,
                                       as painters. I became sort of subconsciously aware of this difference when
                                       Wright told me to design a flat roofed residence. This meant the building
                                       must have the feeling of a home but must have a flat roof. I completely
                                       failed in this as did Wright himself.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11689"></a>The most difficult of all architectural problems, the inexpensive dwelling
                                       was never solved in that office. But when I passed from that stage of my
                                       education into what might be called a post graduate school, in Griffin's
                                       office, I was brought to a comprehension of spatial principles, structural
                                       fundamentals, and the expression of soul requirements, or of human
                                       requirements if you prefer to put it that way, and began to witness the
                                       practice of <u>architecture</u> in this our 20th century. This
                                       was in Griffin's office about 1910.

                                       day world architecture. I have spoken of the first requirement in the primal
                                       landscape conditions of the Melson house of Rock Crest. These conditions
                                       determined the placing of the house on the top of the quarry precipice. This
                                       precipice determined the building material, the local stone. The river
                                       facade of the building continued the sheer precipice to the top of the
                                       house. That there should be no incongruity the roof was flat. When the house
                                       was completed the rough stone treatment made it possible for Griffin to
                                       climb the whole precipice

            <p><a name="d0e11703"></a>from river level to roof. This river frontage is 3 stories high. The lowest
                                       story is the billiard room whose floor forms a continuation of a bit of a
                                       terrace of the cliff which thus becomes accessible from the house, and only
                                       from the house, from the side French windows of the billiard room, for
                                       outdoor seclusion or hide away, or for afternoon tea guests.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11706"></a>Next above are the living rooms. The steep slope on one side of the house
                                       means you can reach out over the windowsill of the dining room and pick wild
                                       violets or other seasonal blossoms flowering at the level of the window
                                       sill. On the other side the more gentle slope opens up lovely more distant
                                       views. From the front windows you look out to the river and step out onto a
                                       balcony veranda cantilevered out from the house so from here your view rakes
                                       up and down the river, and looking down you see the flat river bottom land
                                       with its garden laid out as a huge water lily, the paths separating the
                                       petals, and lily pads of sward surrounding the flower display.

            <p><a name="d0e11709"></a>The top story is bed rooms and the garage, for to this level the drive can be
                                       brought, so this is the level of the entrance to the house. A painter living
                                       in this home could earn his living without ever leaving the house, the views
                                       are so varied and so constantly changing. To dwell in such a house is to be
                                       a living being. Most houses contribute only death forces to their
                                       inhabitants.

            <p><a name="d0e11712"></a>In this house Griffin originated a motif which has had a world wide
                                       influence. Here we are up against the problem of the flat roof. So simple a
                                       means as making tall heavy triple stepped projecting keystones over the
                                       upper windows does the trick. They function as well as ornament, which is an
                                       expression of affection, of feeling, of joy in your work and in your
                                       profession. They give the feeling of substantiality, of 3rd dimension, of
                                       structure, of spatial reality, a very satisfying feeling to us mortals.

                                       architecture where whether a design in carried into construction or not
                                       depends not on the architect but on others, on the client. They

                                       form in a creatively thinking being they remain for all time for they are of
                                       the nature of duration, of other, and are not perishable. One who has the
                                       power of consciousness in these etheric realms can have access to these
                                       forces and bring them down to use in the sensible realms. This faculty is
                                       the essence of genius.

            <p><a name="d0e11740"></a>The first office building for which Griffin made use of this motif has an
                                       interesting history. There was a custom in Australia when giving a foreigner
                                       a job, of requiring that he accept a partner whose only real function was to
                                       collect half of the fee, a manifestation of patriotism. The working drawings
                                       of this building as accepted by the clients when put to the city authorities
                                       for passing bumped up against an objection to a certain projection of a roof
                                       feature 10 stories above the street. This by the way was the first tall
                                       building erected in Australia. So Griffin made an alternate design of the
                                       facade using the stepped pier motif rising above the roof line and by their
                                       depth taking away the thin feeling of the usual city building, since city
                                       buildings frequently present only their front face to the public. At least
                                       that was the case before the stepping back above certain heights was
                                       required for light for the streets below.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e11743"></a>The clients called upon the partner for advice as to whether this design
                                       should be accepted. He was awake to its possibilities so advised against
                                       accepting it. He then got to work with the Building Council and got the
                                       first design passed which was then built. Before many months had passed he
                                       built a city building using the Griffin design. It was not a handsome
                                       building but the motif was there.

                                       completion, and used very charmingly. All around about one sees bridges so
                                       designed, very handsome. The most impressive building of the recent New York

                                       the commonplace building sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems
                                       to be approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently
                                       stimulated by opportunity for unique development in those instances where
                                       long abuse has not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the
                                       neglect. This example comprises 18 acres of the creek frontage between two
                                       bridges. That at the North is a permanent masonry arch carrying an important
                                       thoroughfare route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but
                                       the western footbridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in
                                       the near future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream
                                       of a territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression
                                       to be preserved and respected.

                                       existence is the drab, sooty and monotonous thing our city-dwellers know so
                                       to hate, and get away from into the country whenever a chance offers, if
                                       only to witness others' sport and play or even horses run or, at great
                                       expense, trouble and annoyance, to spend a few hours somewhere in the open
                                       at the week's end. How can it be explained otherwise so that a Melbourne
                                       merchant has had to re-dye with that "fear" color, brown, thousands of yards
                                       of those brilliant and effective henna shades, notwithstanding they were in

                                       popular because they afford an escape on occasions though, unfortunately,
                                       rare in many situations in our climate. One or two ordinary guillotine
                                       windows do not suffice, however, to make daylight and life our own. Upper
                                       sash must be almost continually blinded off to reduce glare. To appreciate
                                       the value of eyebrows in windows, compare the clearness and brilliance of
                                       coloring of nature viewed from under a low spreading tree and then from out
                                       in the open.

                                       position at the time the house is planned. There are possibilities of making
                                       landscape outlooks all the way from window boxes, suntraps and courts, to so
                                       informally grouping our buildings (otherwise than in rows cheek by jowl in
                                       stockaded pens) as to preserve to each whatever common outlook there may be

                                       confinement in cells. Doorways generally afford the sole communication but

                                       through these means, in the settings of the stage or the screen, where the
                                       necessity for romantic expression is always recognized.

                                       sky out of doors. Nothing is so good for this purpose as the glowing green
                                       of the lawns or the buffs of the grain fields or the yellows of the sands to

                                       is accepted in its rawness or, almost unquestionably, in the form of pasty

                                       middle range of the spectrum. These textures can be produced at no greater
                                       expense than the ubiquitous hard, cold, cheerless plaster of paris, and it

                                       absorbent and hence never free of finger marks and all kinds of smudges and
                                       smears and it cannot be cleaned. It necessarily abounds in cracks almost
                                       from the beginning and these have a clear smooth field in which to exhibit
                                       all their vagaries; and finally, it affords no adequate or permanent
                                       foothold for paint, paper or fabric covering so much demanded by its

            <p><a name="d0e11906"></a>The problem of the ceilings is different. These surfaces have the least
                                       effect on the lighting in the daylight but are the all-essential reflectors
                                       of artificial light at night. That, however is another story. It is
                                       sufficient to say that, for such purposes they should invariably be tints
                                       and as may be deduced from what has been said, warm glowing tints.

                                       comfort, and appreciation of nature's own artistry? Or are they merely the
                                       expression of a machine-ridden era and of a more or less indifferent public?

                                       which it may take some thousands of years to eradicate: we have yet to grasp
                                       the simplicity of a really old and fully developed civilization without even
                                       beds or chairs for instance. Among the longer civilized races domestic
                                       ornament in generally restricted to single or significant objects of
                                       interest; it is not, as with us, an objectless accumulation with few, if
                                       any, outstanding features. It is gradually becoming recognized now that the
                                       less furniture a house contains, consistent with its needs, the better. This
                                       is a phase of aesthetics which has been most evident among the people of the
                                       Orient.

            <p><a name="d0e12132"></a>Griffin's post graduate course of education began with the Canberra incident,
                                       a unique thing in many ways but chiefly in the fact that it united two poles
                                       of the earth - Chicago and Canberra. I would like to make an appeal to the
                                       imagination. If you could see what I have seen you would see a child born
                                       with a vision. He fashioned it through into a reality though he had to "Jamb
                                       it down their throats." He died under the power of an Indian Oriental spell,
                                       at least our Indian gardener thought so - thought that the Gods had accepted
                                       Walt's life in the place of his wife's. And in his return to earth in a new

                                       not heed the message seers have given them. Is it ever thus with our seers?

                                       would bind his life - as the orientals among our European peoples think -
                                       with the antipodes as in other polarities where up is bound with down or
                                       inside with outside. If you project a line from America through to the
                                       center of the earth it will hit the realm of the ancient Lemuria whence
                                       Australia sprang. There at about the same time another man was born. James
                                       Alexander Smith was ruled by the Midnight Sun which bound him to the land of
                                       his birth though he was much better known in other lands than in his own - a
                                       great creative scientist to whom many doors were opened in the Western
                                       Hemisphere among them a complete laboratory and to do as he liked by our

            <p><a name="d0e12138"></a>But to fulfill their vision these two men had to come together. The
                                       Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while
                                       still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two
                                       people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but
                                       one must fight the whole past to the death to make them come true - "sweat
                                       and tears and blood."

                                       astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise
                                       that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan, and I answered -
                                       of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of
                                       what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in
                                       such limited visions, such self-centered hopes. Mr. <a name="342"></a> [Note: John

                                       year because he spent his time drawing city plans, laying down their basic
                                       principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet
                                       built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of
                                       communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign,
                                       Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created for him
                                       thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin
                                       came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the
                                       world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete
                                       confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all the
                                       architectural publications for the announcement of an international
                                       competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous
                                       for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intended should
                                       happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world
                                       at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by
                                       means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a

                                       there, to her unbelieving eyes, was the announcement. On request, complete
                                       data for the same was received from Australia. But the office was busy and

            <p><a name="d0e12175"></a>During my early life I was led by the passing Will o' the Wisp in what I did
                                       - drawing, dancing, drama, architecture. Not so after my marriage - Yes even
                                       before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful
                                       person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I
                                       presently became deeply centered in the task of lending a hand in all the
                                       various emergencies that arose. Truly I lost myself in him and found it
                                       completely satisfying. That is the normal difference between men and women
                                       though the task of each is now to become a complete human being - both
                                       receptive and creative. Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as
                                       well as our greatest agonies.

                                       as pastoral, and jig, and hymn and dirge.

                                       centuries it finally dawned on us that there was a law in accordance with
                                       which sounds were pleasing or displeasing to us. We studied into the nature

                                       extent we gain control over nature and become powerful accordingly.

            <p><a name="d0e12259"></a>But a building is line, form, motive, and until we realize that they must be
                                       used in conformity to law to be pleasing we will get occasional satisfying
                                       results as are found in barbaric music but no great or growing architecture
                                       and as all things act and react on each other so the very development of our
                                       character, of our souls, is dependent on these laws of nature which are
                                       spiritual as well as physical in themselves and in their effects.

            <p><a name="d0e12262"></a>A motive in design must therefore be used with great care, we can take a
                                       simple theme which alone may give relief to what might otherwise be a
                                       monotone too severe to be entirely desirable. Such a note can be very
                                       charmingly introduced in a home by a bit of design with perhaps a touch of
                                       color in the window glass. Any evidence of affectionate treatment of any
                                       useful element in a structure is very pleasing. This same motive, or
                                       developments of it, can be carried into the case doors and illumination
                                       fixtures. There is no limit to the elaboration possible and beautiful in
                                       following this plan. The design can be carried into a rug or the draperies
                                       or the china but always the designs must be related to each other either by
                                       conformity or contrast. It is not possible to say that any one degree of
                                       elaboration is better than another. Each one is a song. Only to overdevelop
                                       one part and neglect another would be as bad as to put the treble of a
                                       symphony with the base of a finger exercise. Balance of all parts

            <p><a name="d0e12281"></a>is essential. This matter of balance depends primarily on the arrangement of
                                       the plan of the house. The necessities of the small house holder are totally
                                       different from those of larger establishments and the introduction of
                                       elements which are most convenient in the latter case into the former
                                       problem resulting from lack of realization of the difference in the problem
                                       often leads to waste, extravagance and actual inconvenience. This often
                                       happens when a pantry is being considered where there are several servants
                                       to prevent too great confusion in the one room, to enable the housekeeper to
                                       have a place to work where she will not interfere with the cook, or to
                                       separate the confusion of a room where people are working from the dining
                                       room, but in the bungalow where one does one's own work or at most employs
                                       one assistant, it means added steps, inconvenience in getting at implements
                                       and materials, waste of space. A small kitchen properly arranged with
                                       cupboards on the walls is not only an economy in building but a most
                                       desirable arrangement for the housekeeper. When we stop to think what meals
                                       can be turned out of the tiny kitchen of a dining car we are brought to a
                                       realizing sense of the wastefulness and inconvenience of our ordinary
                                       domestic arrangements. Again the space used for hall and stairway in a large
                                       house become most inconvenient in a bungalow. The plan should be so arranged
                                       that in a compact and restricted area access can be given to all the various
                                       parts of the house as entrance, living room, kitchen and second story while
                                       maintaining the privacy of each and avoiding making a thoroughfare of any.
                                       The grand stair way appropriate enough in a palace with its functions of
                                       pomp and parade become an absurdity in our domestic life, a manner of living
                                       totally unknown two centuries ago.

                                       are many times when for social purposes it is necessary to have a large

                                       the nature of these two rooms is such that when one of them is occupied the
                                       other is empty.

            <p><a name="d0e12295"></a>The economy of throwing the space of the two together is obvious. The
                                       necessity of separating guests from the confusion of elaborate service does
                                       not exist. Such separation of dining table from living quarters as might
                                       occasionally be needed can be easily effected by the use of a screen. On
                                       festival occasions the whole space can serve as dining room, arranged with
                                       tables which can be easily removed leaving a fine big room for frolic when
                                       the feast is done. Indeed I have known very small houses that could
                                       entertain on a much larger scale than really big houses, simply as a
                                       consequence of a well thought out plan.

            <p><a name="d0e12298"></a>Small rooms, each capable of being cut off from the others, is an arrangement

                                       difficulties in housekeeping which made it easier to keep one room
                                       immaculate, ready for the reception of the occasional guest. We live too
                                       close to each other in these days, too intimately, on too <a name="346"></a> [Note: reading from

                                       spot. We open our homes as our hearts and are not ashamed of our
                                       occupations. It is no doubt convenient to have one room, call it a reception
                                       room or den or grouch or study or office, where seclusion is possible but
                                       under ordinary circumstances this need is subordinate to the more constant
                                       and pressing needs of our everyday life where more and more we are becoming
                                       conscious of harmonizing and unifying the interests of all the members of a

                                       movements unifying the social life of old and young, bringing together all

                                       like to make an appeal to the imagination. If you could see what I have seen
                                       you would see a child born with a vision. He fashioned it through into a
                                       reality though he had to "Jamb it down their throats." He died under the
                                       power of an Indian Oriental spell, at least our Indian gardener thought so -
                                       thought that the Gods had accepted Walt's life in the place of his wife's.
                                       And in his return to earth in a new incarnation he sees humanity falling to
                                       pieces because men of our time will not heed the message seers have given
                                       them. Is it ever thus with our seers? Can we never learn to listen and give
                                       heed?

                                       same time another man was born. James Alexander Smith was ruled by the
                                       Midnight Sun which bound him to the land of his birth though he was much
                                       better known in other lands than in his own - a great creative scientist to
                                       whom many doors were opened in the Western Hemisphere among them a complete
                                       laboratory and to do as he liked by our Westinghouse Company.

                                       Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while
                                       still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two
                                       people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but
                                       one must fight the whole past to the death to make them come true - "sweat

                                       astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise
                                       that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan, and I answered -
                                       of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of
                                       what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in

                                       principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet
                                       built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of
                                       communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign,
                                       Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created for him
                                       thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin
                                       came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the
                                       world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete
                                       confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all the
                                       architectural publications for the announcement of an international
                                       competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous
                                       for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intended should
                                       happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world
                                       at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by
                                       means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a

                                       before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful
                                       person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I

                                       leaf form - of the clover leaf - and, as the great poet Goethe told us and
                                       as all the scientific world now knows, the leaf form is the original parent
                                       of all plant life. We call that parent form the archetype.

            <p><a name="d0e12420"></a>Then the Sun Beings laughed with joy and said let us tell all creation what
                                       we have done and the Sun Beings joined the Fire Beings who had come down
                                       from the great primeval Saturn, the origin of the Solar system whose rings
                                       still tell us the story of the origin of substance which the smashing of the
                                       atom has now confirmed. They sang - Let us illuminate the world so that all
                                       may know of this lovely thing and all the lovely things we do. So they
                                       created radiating light. They illuminated the world -A- <a name="353"></a> [Note: "-B-" in
                                       AIC]. They sent out great radiating streams of light, for from heat we
                                       can't get light. Not until the great Spirits said, "Let there be light." So
                                       with light a new form was created - the triangular form -B-.

            <p><a name="d0e12426"></a>Now these Beings love to work in rhythms, we call that the music of the
                                       spheres for all music, all sound, comes from rhythm. We call it vibration.
                                       So there was Light and then when the Spirits rested they called in the
                                       Spirits of Sound. The light ceased for a time and then there was darkness
                                       which is just as real a thing as light. This was the creation of the Moon
                                       Beings. In it the Moon Beings play. They are -C-

                                       and music filled the universe for these waves are sound waves. The shape of
                                       these waves is the half circle or the crescent. We know that the other side

                                       their crescent waves against the radiating light they got the forms built up
                                       by the interplay of light and darkness and these are the living things for
                                       the Spirits of Light and Darkness keep things moving and growing all the
                                       time, the light filling things with color and the dark filling them with
                                       sound so they can be both seen and heard -D-.

                                       the Fire Beings. The Stars have been throwing their radiating beams across
                                       the sky and in their crossings a new form has been created, and then many
                                       new forms. Let us see how it works -E-. A star is a point in the universe.

                                       have children and we human beings call these children of the angelic Beings

                                       wonderful things as well as the children of the angels. These began to build
                                       up a tree. They first of all had to have the idea of a tree for no one can

                                       they had seen the lovely forms the Water Beings were tossing up into the
                                       triangle of the Airy Beings, the Light Beings. So in council they told the
                                       fairies and they all agreed to help bring these forms into the Earth which
                                       had now be become a solid body with water and air and warmth around it. The
                                       Undines being water fairies had to ask permission of the gnomes to transform
                                       some of their crystals into liquids. The gnomes agreed and began to design
                                       passages in the rocks so that as the Undines, who were the chemists, worked
                                       they could help them to change the form of the crystals from the usual forms
                                       to the forms of water crystals, the frost, which grows and spreads out
                                       branches, and the gnomes made it possible for these forms to last for quite
                                       a while, not as long as the earth crystals for you know how quickly

                                       wonderful time the Undines and the gnomes were having so they offered to
                                       help. So the Sylphs designed all sorts of flowers and painted them all sorts
                                       of colors for they are the light fairies so they contributed not only the
                                       air for food but also condensed the light into tiny comet like bodies and
                                       fed it to the plants making it possible for the flowers to develop.

                                       different kinds of trees and plants could come into the earth world.

            <p><a name="d0e12530"></a>And it is as well that they did so for the earth itself, the crystals,
                                       neither animal nor man can eat. Only the plants are smart enough to
                                       transform crystals into food and of course they could not do it if the
                                       fairies didn't show them how. The Fire Fairies have command of the formative
                                       forces which is the warmth ether which as I told you creates spherical forms
                                       so they could not do much for the plants at first. We recognize their work
                                       in the fruits which are mostly more or less spheroid. Sometimes we see that
                                       the sylphs have helped them as in the seed of the pine tree which is a
                                       triangular pyramid. We see how they helped the Undines too in building the
                                       tremendously tall triangle of the trunk of the fern and the pine so very
                                       symmetrical in form. Especially in these early works of the fairies was the
                                       work of the first hierarchies, the star beings and the sun, evident in the
                                       form of the plant as a whole.

                                       tendency in similar portions of Chicago, imply for this site adaptation to a
                                       predominantly residential function. Since the site is flat and the problem
                                       an economic one, irregular curves and acute intersections may be entirely
                                       avoided.

            <p><a name="d0e13674"></a>The high degree of intensity or this plan is shown by its 1224 lots, with
                                       their average dimensions of 37 x 100 feet, and is commendable, yet this
                                       intensity has been accomplished at the <u>lowest cost</u> of any
                                       of the plans submitted. It has <u>not</u> secured this result at
                                           <u>the sacrifice of park and playground spaces</u>, which
                                       are situated in such a way as to enhance land values very materially. The
                                       arrangement of houses secures for many the maximum possible exposures.
                                       Therefore the intensity has not been achieved at the expense of sunlight and
                                       air.

                                       concerned; but it is improbable that for an area of this size such a large
                                       percentage of community features would be economical. Therefore a location
                                       of these commercial objectives along the two car lines, instead of on all
                                       sides, would seem to be the better design.

            <p><a name="d0e13689"></a>It is especially good designing from an economic standpoint that the
                                       non-commercial community objectives are splendidly distributed to secure a

                                       perpendicular to the car line, were <u>other considerations not

                                       traffic would be negligible on account of the extent of detour involved by
                                       the central public space - a detour which would, of course, be saved by the
                                       use of the thoroughfares flanking this quarter-section.

                                       prostituting of the profession, the architect subsisting on the life blood
                                       of his draftsmen. The taste for this sort of thing is whetted and the
                                       conscience salved by the fact that in this unreasonable social system of
                                       ours it is only too common to find the man who works starving while, through
                                       some special privilege, the man who does not work feeds fat off the fruits
                                       of the other man's labor.

                                       feeding off the tissue of our spiritual growth, causing arrest of
                                       development or degeneracy, even as physically the parents of many of our
                                       children do in factory towns. They should be inspiration and incentive to a
                                       geometrical progression in achievement, rejoicing in the greater
                                       accomplishment of those following. A teacher is no teacher at all unless the
                                       work of his pupils exceeds the quality of his own and each generation is
                                       under obligation not only to do its own work but so to teach the succeeding
                                       generation as to cause progress. And here is the only value of tradition.

                                       Gothic and primitive. But their difference from the copy-book school is that
                                       they employ the same natural method and do not consider external form first
                                       and shamefacedly hide behind it as best they can the element of use. They
                                       glory in the laws of nature where everything has its purpose, and "Form"
                                       becomes satisfying only when it best fits and expresses that function. They
                                       believe not in art for "art's sake" but that art consists in doing necessary
                                       things in the best possible way - that art except as a result of need,
                                       physical or spiritual, is degenerative instead of progressive; that in this

                                       in America, Louis Sullivan, has been very widespread in his own country and
                                       elsewhere. It must not be confused with the idea of democracy which is
                                       purely the realm of Equity. Mr. Sullivan's intelligent comprehension of the
                                       principles he was working on made his own work a continuous progression and
                                       gave it a remarkable variety whereas an interest simply in one's own
                                       achievement leads gradually to an imitation of one's self and a stereotyping
                                       of manner and motives which, bit by bit, transform even rational
                                       architecture into personal architecture. For problems are ever new and one's
                                       work must be either static or developing.

                                       only of the historian. We find also the intermediate men who, though
                                       following this method of thinking, would deny this right to others making
                                       claims as grotesque as those of Bottom <a name="380"></a> [Note: in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
                                           Night's Dream"] who would be the lion too. The consequence of this
                                       greed was that the development of this movement was seriously handicapped in
                                       the neighborhood of its origin. In the intellectual or imaginative world we
                                       must recognize the right of every man to the use of his own thinking powers.
                                       Priority in claim no more gives a man a right to monopolization than it does

                                       would have been the consequence to the development of Gothic architecture if
                                       the man who claimed first to have used a buttress had been able to deny
                                       others the right to use it, or if at any stage, say when the flying buttress
                                       was used, any such attempt had been tolerated. There never would have been
                                       any Gothic architecture.

                                       use all the powers of nature - physical, intellectual, spiritual. It is,
                                       however, not sufficient that man use his reasoning powers for this faculty
                                       can disport itself in fantastic fields entirely unproductive. If his efforts
                                       are to be fruitful he must learn the laws of nature and act in conformity
                                       with them. The old Greek fable is forever true. Man loses his strength when

                                       you wish to call it. Though all new movements derive from one individual
                                       since ideas arise in the human mind, when that has happened the way is open
                                       to all humanity to carry on the work. The foundation has been laid. Louis
                                       Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was felt
                                       as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully in the early
                                       decades. His successors vary in degree of creative power but they are not
                                       founders. The delay in the development of creative design was largely due to
                                       the malicious vanity of one <a name="384"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] who had been
                                       inducted by Sullivan himself.

            <p><a name="d0e13819"></a>The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every
                                       field of life, in every occupation; and taking maximum advantage of its
                                       gifts is the task of the designer. The power of a conscientious
                                       consideration of all the elements of a problem was brought home to me when I
                                       saw the revolution in methods and results that took place when landscape was
                                       made a part of architecture, when Griffin entered into partnership with
                                           <a name="385"></a> [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright. It meant not only a broadening of view
                                       but a positiveness of action arising from the firm foundation of definite
                                       facts determining the general scheme before taking up details of internal
                                       requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean gardening as an
                                       afterthought to a building but means consideration of the external elements
                                       before starting to plan or build <a name="386"></a> [Note: reading from N-YHS]. Not only
                                       natural conditions but the character of the surrounding buildings have
                                       sometimes to be taken advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. We must
                                       consider not the mere personal point but must look to the advantage to
                                       everyone affected, for it is curiously true that a thing to be a permanent
                                       advantage to one must be of advantage to everyone, just as in animal or man
                                       a sound organ is of vital importance to all the organs. Human society is an
                                       organism and the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all
                                       since all are independent as root, branch, leaf and flower of a tree.

            <p><a name="d0e13828"></a>On the whole in America as well as elsewhere a building, a residence, was a
                                       parallelogram. Nothing else was done. The Greek thinking was back of this, a
                                       religious recognition of the 4th period of our present human cycle as the
                                       pyramid was a recognition of the 3rd the Egyptian period. Once the
                                       parallelogram was established the almost automatic thinking of our times
                                       flowed on in the same old grooves. After all the mechanical is the idol of
                                       the present age so why not leave our mind to its tendency to work
                                       automatically.

            <p><a name="d0e13836"></a>Now in this 5th period the tradition was finally broken down. The plan was
                                       not necessarily a parallelogram, and freer forms developed to be carried on
                                       later by Griffin in an endless variety of crystalline forms for he conceived
                                       of buildings not as facades but as three dimensional. This is creative
                                       thinking. We learn that there are as many universes as there are crystalline
                                       forms each created by a great primal Spirit of Mathematics.

                                       the world. It is certainly unique. It introduced Griffin to Australia
                                       because it was the first completed work of his over there. It occupied the
                                       ground floor of a down town building under the light well of the building
                                       and consisted of five rooms separated not by walls but by great piers which
                                       carried the structure of the building above.

            <p><a name="d0e13899"></a>It is lighted in part by the open vaulted grill under the light well and
                                       partly by stained glass ceiling panels screening electric lamps. The tiles
                                       used are real gold Delft tiles brought from Holland. The sculpture was done
                                       by Miss <a name="387"></a> [Note: Margaret] Baskerville of Melbourne and the mural

                                       goes well with the Henry Ford dwelling. Do tell me everything. No just drop
                                       me a line. It's a pity to spoil a good outing by writing letters. But a line
                                       I must have. Love from your cheerful (honest) wife, Marion Mahony Griffin

                                           <a name="392"></a> [Note: Pago Pago?] now which inclines me to be foolish again. But
                                       you love me just the same - no es verdad? Have you decided by now to leave
                                       me in the States for the next few years while you get Australia straightened
                                       out? May be Mr. Lawrence can't get along with women but he and I get along
                                       fine. Mr. Jackson was in yesterday. Wanted to meet Mr. Lawrence. He said the
                                       trustees wanted me to come down once, that they valued my opinion highly.
                                       Thank heaven he said either before your return or afterward with you. It was
                                       a very pleasant courtesy and he put it in a very pleasant way. Of course I
                                       chose to go with you later. My thought is with you constantly, my love, your

                                       be home soon. I have decided that one might just as well be the wife of a
                                       sailor as a city planner. I don't expect ever to get any satisfaction out of
                                       you again. The only letter in which I wrote you must come home right away
                                       (My knees were cold) was returned to me. Evidently fate did not intend I

                                       amusing one from Gerald <a name="399"></a> [Note: MMG's brother]. He signed it on the
                                       typewriter saying his fingernails were all smashed except his thumbs and
                                       that he had written this letter with his thumbs. Would you think it feasible
                                       for Gerald to go into contracting and could we use him on the Trier Center
                                       work. If Mr. Blount <a name="400"></a> [Note: a home developer in Beverly, Illinois] could
                                       why not Gerald. Mr. Von Holst sent me a copy of the letter he wrote Mr.
                                       Felton concerning the publication of the <a name="401"></a> [Note: David M.] Amberg

                                       surely will be letters. Miss <a name="403"></a> [Note: Stella (Miles)] Franklin was so
                                       delighted with your enthusiasm about Australia. She does hope you won't let

                                       as Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital). Isn't it
                                       wonderful that you actually are going to build your city. It's almost more
                                       that I can realize, but I am so happy about it that I can hardly keep from
                                       shouting it aloud. Your appointment isn't really so much of a surprise after

                                       to get the full extent of its meaning but it will have to soak in gradually.
                                       To say I congratulate you or to express my feelings in any kind of words
                                       would be wholly inadequate but you know anyway how more than happy I am
                                       about it. Six months leave of absence and then back to Australia for three
                                       years! It's plain to see that your permanent place of residence will be your
                                       capital city. I do so wish that it wasn't so awfully far away especially as
                                       I fear that teaching will never pay me enough so that I can afford such a
                                       long trip. As glad as I am about your appointment I can't be glad that you
                                       are going to be at the other end of the earth and I don't see how we are
                                       ever going to be able to get along without you. With much love, Gertrude.

                                       about business. I want you. It seems as if I'd suffocate, there are bands of
                                       iron around my heart so it can't beat. The joy in my soul over your
                                       beautiful success can't entirely keep me from being sick to see you. I wish
                                       I could have gone over with you. I shouldn't have wanted to be in the melee
                                       but everything would have gone perfectly well here without me. Mr. Lawrence
                                       is the most conscientious and painstaking person on earth and Roy is too
                                       though he worries Lawrence quite a bit by going off sailing on the lake when
                                       according to Lawrence's standards he should be working. With Gerald here I
                                       think we are going to have an organization that will be able to carry the
                                       work during your absences. But I cannot live on business. In fact I'm
                                       working less and less. Two months more is a dreadful long time. Each week
                                       seems like a month. I keep counting wrong, thinking two weeks have gone when
                                       only one has and then it seems as if time was standing still and you never
                                       would be back again. However I'm trying to feel that this postponement is
                                       the last one. Please come home. Marion

                                       ends, to understand the ends. For the world and its creative forces do not
                                       work on straight lines like rational thinking. Creation works in circles and

                                       us take a circle and encompass a sphere and we can learn, and so shall be
                                       able to accomplish what is necessary to accomplish in our time. For we have
                                       come to a time when isolation will not work. Humanity must be treated as a

                                       practically the whole volcanic realm. We remember that warmth was the <u>original substance</u> of the solar system still functioning
                                       here on earth as are unicellular beings so that man may read the story of

                                       evolution of human society, we start from the end - America - take the
                                       plunge and find the beginning. We have perhaps flown, taken the modern way,
                                       traversed the realm of the air, the 2nd condition of matter, the realm

                                       reflections in the creations that follow. We come down in the great ocean -
                                       the whole southern hemisphere almost - the 3rd condition of matter, and find
                                       the very earliest bit of solidity still existing - the 4th condition of

                                       degrees in the stiffest Sydney University courses, proving that differences
                                       in race have ceased to exist since Christ gave that "light" to every man
                                       that cometh into the world. The English lads and lassies love to become as
                                       dark as our negro people through basking in the sun of this earthly
                                       paradise. And the custom of competition for prizes in the Queensland schools
                                       was given up because usually the schools of the aboriginal children
                                       overtopped the others.

                                       impossible though seeming to be its implement. From this hoax America was
                                       saved through the genius of its founders who know of their own experience
                                       the nature of this evil form and invented a new one - the Congressional -

                                       are properly educated. This is not possible unless all the children have
                                       access to nature, natural continuous contact throughout childhood - all of
                                       them. Otherwise they cannot develop inventive or creative powers to say
                                       nothing of health. The geniuses come from the rural districts not the urban.
                                       To give the children this is not possible without community planning which
                                       facilitates decentralization, puts an end to overcrowded cities and an end
                                       to wide open spaces too sparsely occupied. It interlaces the urban and the

                                       confidence in their own decisions as a basis for free will, the power to
                                       receive revelations was necessarily withdrawn from men for a time. Through
                                       Anthroposophy, the Twentieth Century science, which, along with the smashing
                                       of the atom in the atomic bomb, revolutionizes thinking for this century as
                                       material science did the thinking of the nineteenth century, this power of
                                       receiving information directly from the spiritual realms can again be
                                       developed but it must now be in a Christian form and not pre-Christian if it
                                       is to be wholesome and developmental. This difference of method is of vital
                                       importance and is but little understood today so that many unfortunate
                                       things are happening through the longing for direct knowledge of spiritual
                                       realities without any comprehension of the nature of Christian requirements.

            <p><a name="d0e14121"></a>Since the creation by the Christ was the creation of a being who could attain
                                       to responsibility which is dependent on free will and, since with His coming
                                       into the Jesus being where He dwelt for three years, He gave to man the
                                       individualized Ego (which he gave to every man that cometh into the world)
                                       which marked man's maturity and readiness to function in free will, the
                                       power to develop the faculties necessary for the reception of revelation
                                       must reside in each individual human being.

            <p><a name="d0e14124"></a>But since the all important factor is the retention and development of free
                                       will, no method must be used now which dulls man's fully awake consciousness
                                       nor which interferes in the slightest degree with the free action of his
                                       will. The only form of occultism recognized by natural science is hypnotism,
                                       but these scientists know nothing of what they are actually doing nor can
                                       they know its dangers nor its serious or even fatal consequences. The
                                       process used is to substitute another's will which is an attack on the

                                       pre-Christian times, when man had not reached his maturity so that he was
                                       still under the guidance of Angelic beings were all dependent on this
                                       dulling of consciousness and depression of the will and had to be carried
                                       out with great care. They were used only in the mystery schools and with
                                       specially chosen and developed individuals under the guidance of the
                                       initiates. The underlying principle is like that of hypnotism and was
                                       appropriate in those past preliminary civilizations, and the precautions
                                       necessary were understood. They all entailed dulling of the normal
                                       faculties.

                                       serves no useful purpose. They belong to the past. They solve no problems.
                                       We are familiar with them in various forms, Yogi, mediumship, spiritualism,
                                       etc. However, the awakening and making use of the perceptive organs of the
                                       Etheric body in full consciousness and with no dulling of any of our normal
                                       faculties is urgently necessary at the present time. A new revolution in
                                       thinking is as necessary in the Twentieth Century as that of the Nineteenth
                                       Century was in its time.

                                       atoms into each other in the laboratories of our universities but they are
                                       very shy about publicizing this fact. In California I asked a University
                                       Professor to show me their atom smasher. He said, "Yes if you can call it an

                                       descent into matter, was completed, it is now our task to bring about the
                                       ascent into spirit. With the Light (He was the Life and the Life was the
                                       Light of man) now in man it becomes his task to carry on evolution, and the
                                       Earth's evolution as well as his own becomes his task <a name="407"></a> [Note: "man's task"
                                           typed over?] though the Christ will be with us till the end of the
                                       Earth period. Since man is now mature enough to function as a responsible
                                       being, since the period of faith has led on to the period of knowledge, the
                                       Angels can no longer be permitted to guide men as they did in the past. He
                                       must make his own decisions. Otherwise he could not carry on his evolution
                                       as a free being. He can become fully cognizant of his nature only if the
                                       consequences <a name="408"></a> [Note: "of" inserted in N-YHS] his deeds fall upon him. So
                                       in the latter decades of the nineteenth century the Archangel Michael, who
                                       in biblical times functioned as the Countenance of Jehovah, took over the
                                       rulership of intelligence in the Cosmos. In a way he now functions as the
                                       countenance of the Christ and he will not compromise. Now if human beings
                                       want the assistance of the Angelic Beings they must come to them
                                           <a name="409"></a> [Note: "him"?] for guidance out of their own free will; they must
                                       use all their powers and faculties to solve their problems and then come to
                                       Michael of their own free will and he will give them help.

                                       through Will, deeds, and as a unit in a trinity dogma ceases to exist. Art
                                       is functioning in the thinking realm. We find all sorts of thought out
                                       tricks and devices taking the place of genius in Art where feeling should
                                       rule. Religion has become nothing but the expression of feeling whereas its
                                       realm is will, deeds. The task of this period of Evolution is to reunite the
                                       three into a true unity, when they will again function in accordance with
                                       their true nature. Thus can Christianity become a reality functioning in
                                       every department of life. The Earth is a living Being and at present we are
                                       killing it. With the Christ event the further evolution of man and the Earth
                                       was placed in man's hands. The barometer itself proves that the earth is a
                                       living breathing being for there is no other way of explaining the double
                                       recording of high and low pressures of this instrument. What our time needs
                                       is a little more confidence in facts and a bit less theorizing.

            <p><a name="d0e14224"></a>What then is the constitution of the Earth Being where the Christ now dwells.
                                       To our physical senses there are 3 conditions. There are however 4 cause
                                       forces in action and they create 4 conditions of matter. The primal ether
                                       expresses itself in the condition of matter called warmth. This forms the
                                       outer sphere of the earth. This information is but just confirmed through
                                       aeronautics, the study of the stratosphere.

                                       That has never been the case at night when the chemical ether is breathed
                                       back into the earth but until recently no attention has been paid to that
                                       fact. Now a student hears it spoken of as temperature reversal. But what
                                       spiritual science has observed is now being corroborated by high fliers who
                                       even in the daytime reach a level where the temperature begins to increase.
                                       Physical scientists are likely to begin to the theorize and generalize about
                                       that. Already I have seen an article by a scientist saying

                                       when we go on from the earth's warmth ether realm though the warmth material
                                       no longer exists, the ethers themselves exist in the reverse order.

                                       difference between the organic and the inorganic. That the Earth is an
                                       organic being is again evidenced in another reversal as we go toward the
                                       center.

            <p><a name="d0e14241"></a>It is of course impossible to enumerate the consequences of these facts. The

                                       all branches of science. The aim of living beings therefore should not be

                                       should be growth, development. The great work of the physical scientist was
                                       the establishing in the minds of modern men the fact of evolution. That

                                       from man does not alter the fact of the value of their contribution. They
                                       arbitrarily limited their observations to what can be perceived by material
                                       sense organs. We do not need to limit ourselves in any such way. The time
                                       has come when the further advance of civilization hangs on our using all our
                                       perceptive organs, physical and etheric.

            <p><a name="d0e14271"></a>I told her that physically speaking the interior the Sun was a vacuum; it
                                       contained no material substance. But it was filled with life ether. She
                                       repeated this to her uncle, Professor <a name="413"></a> [Note: Henry L.?] Brose, who had
                                       charge of the Rockefeller laboratory in Sydney and who had worked with
                                       Rutherford and Einstein in Europe. He told her that was nonsense, if that
                                       were the case everything would be falling into it. The burning ball
                                       conception means that they consider the great radiations shown in
                                       photographs to be flames reaching out from the Sun. Within 6 months news
                                       came through that 2 young astronomers, in Kentucky I think, had for 2 years
                                       been taking moving pictures of the Sun which revealed a movement inward to
                                       the Sun. The life ether being the creative cause of solidity in which
                                       gravity manifests is naturally attractive force itself. I myself at one time
                                       had the impulse to concentrate my attention on the Sun and suddenly saw its
                                       as one does in photographs, with the luminous radiations and the whole
                                       interior sphere, or disc as I saw it, lilac, the life ether color, the color
                                       I had seen rising from the seed.

            <p><a name="d0e14277"></a>These Sun forces act on the earth vertically, whereas the Moon forces act
                                       horizontally as is checked by physical science which finds the magnetic
                                       forces of the Moon at their maximum from the horizon. Physical science would
                                       reasonably conclude that, like the Sun, it would have its maximum influence
                                       from the Zenith. But this is contrary to fact. These polarities are
                                       expressed in physical creatures in the typical horizontal backbone of the
                                       animal versus the vertical backbone of man, hence their different types of
                                       consciousness. One might say that the Sun is the Ruler of Plant and Man, the
                                       Moon of the Animal.

                                       called the instincts of animals of which science can say nothing. It uses a
                                       word and rests satisfied with that. In fact that is what all our thinkers
                                       have been driven to - nominalism. They might as well answer every question
                                       that arises with the - "Quien sabe?" of the Spanish. But today we must not
                                       rest short of the answer to questions. Otherwise the chaos that we see on
                                       our horizons will become world wide. Anthroposophy consists in the capacity

            <p><a name="d0e14291"></a>When the great seasonal migration of the birds takes place how does this come
                                       about for we know that even the new season birds can take these great
                                       journeys. How do they know the route is asked? But they don't know the
                                       route. The seasonal movements of the Sun set flowing great and powerful
                                       streams of the Ethers, the North and South currents. These the birds are
                                       aware of and they follow the currents even fighting against heavy storms and
                                       powerful air currents. I went to Cowes Island <a name="414"></a> [Note: Phillip Island?]
                                       in Melbourne's harbor to witness the coming of the Mutton birds from the
                                       South Pole continent in the spring. When the day arrived I was much
                                       perturbed at the coolness of the hotel-keeper whose coach was to take us to
                                       the particular point of the shore. I didn't want to miss the spectacle. But
                                       he said afternoon would be soon enough. After lunch I pressed again for
                                       starting. But he said if we started at half past two we would be in time. We
                                       arrived at the appointed spot. No sign of birds and he said they wouldn't be
                                       along for 20 minutes yet. In 20 minutes they came blackening the sky indeed
                                       they came in such numbers. You see they had an even more accurate clock than
                                       ours, the Sun itself, for their time-keeper.

                                       planned the Federal Capital, built the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne, and
                                       designed the garden suburb of Castlecrag, Sydney. But Mr. Griffin is also
                                       keenly interested in the problem of small house construction, and in the
                                       following columns he presents a brief description of what he has termed
                                       segmental architecture. It is a system that employs building units of
                                       special design, and its object is to reduce the cost of building houses -
                                       particularly small homes - at the same time scorning monotony and providing
                                       for an uncommon style of residence.

                                       complex processes of building now in vogue. It is realized that the

                                       calling me into his office in the early days in Australia to inform me that
                                       Mr. Griffin was to do as he told him (which of course he never did) and who
                                       spent an amazing amount of time vilifying Griffin even going to the Prime
                                       Minister Mr. <a name="416"></a> [Note: William Morris] Hughes.

            <p><a name="d0e14471"></a>Mr. Hughes was not so easily handled however and simply handed over Taylor's
                                       papers to Mr. Griffin.

            <p><a name="d0e14474"></a>Largely impelled by his venom he visited the United States and called on
                                       various architects who gave him much material for his magazine. Wright did
                                       not give him any but he listened to the knitlock story and shortly after
                                       built this structure in California. He was always quick on the uptake. This
                                       however except in superficial appearance has not structural resemblance to
                                       knitlock and no structural value. He also followed the hint Taylor gave him
                                       about floors solid on the ground and used the idea but with no structural
                                       basis, which of course Taylor couldn't give him, so of course the water
                                       poured in and the floor had to <a name="417"></a> [Note: be?] supplemented with another.
                                       Griffin's method of construction was not grasped. Griffin laid an asphalt
                                       layer under the whole house with 2" x 4" strips cut in two with the narrow
                                       edge upward <a name="418"></a> [Note: and?] laid it in flush with the top so that when the

                                       connecting belt lines has been co-ordinated with motor speedways to enable
                                       an orderly development of 6 municipal centers indicated by double ovals
                                       which relieve the pressure on the main urban business center on the lake.

                                       so that the practical needs of the outlying districts are met minimizing the
                                       excessive crowding of the metropolitan center. Sydney, Australia is an
                                       example of such a grouping of metropolis and surrounding municipalities
                                       which are independent politically as well as officially. The arrangement
                                       works well.

                                       cripples, criminals, with no chance for genius to sprout nor enthusiasm to
                                       develop; death and disease are rampant.<br> Between the thoroughfares there
                                       should be no speedways, no short cuts, no wide streets. On the other hand
                                       there should be no stub end streets but direct access, for everyone within,
                                       to the business circumference - shops, movies, etc. The whole will be safe.
                                       Children can go to the interior schools or to the circumferential shops
                                       without danger.<br> The omission of alleys and the narrowing of the streets
                                       and the carrying of none through will accomplish these and many other
                                       things. It will give 16 parks to every quarter section where contact with
                                       nature, people and sports will make humans of the growing generation.

                                       than that of Communism for the latter is openly controlled by the
                                       bureaucracy whereas the parliamentary form is just as completely controlled
                                       but so cleverly that no one seems to be aware of it. But the consequences
                                       are there and can be measured by a comparison of the welfare of the people
                                       of Europe and America.

            <p><a name="d0e14848"></a>It is urgent also since now the Oriental peoples "whose numbers reach the
                                       billion mark" are quite equal to the Occidentals "whose number is but a few
                                       million" in intellectual, scientific and mechanical ability. The recent war
                                       has thoroughly awakened them to the issues of EMPLOYMENT. They are ripe for
                                       reorganization.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14851"></a>Experience of life under each form, the Congressional and the Parliamentary,
                                       makes clear the radical difference between the two which is understood by
                                       almost no one, yet is the chief issue today as it was in the 1st World War.
                                       It is the basic issue of employment since it is the issue between
                                       concentrated Power and Democracy.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14854"></a>Only under the Congressional form of government do the people have the
                                       opportunity, if they chose to use it, of selecting their executive. The
                                       electoral system <a name="431"></a> [Note: US Electoral College?], a hang-over from the
                                       past, should be ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in
                                       the reach of the masses of the people.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14860"></a>Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes, the bureaucracy,
                                       can determine the executive from the start or at any time after the election
                                       by throwing out the elected party whenever it wants to which gives it a
                                       powerful influence over members even without overthrowing the party. They
                                       vote as they are told to vote or out they go, and the whole complicated and
                                       expensive business of election has to be gone through again. No wonder the
                                       people are dejected. Naturally the more businesses that are put in the hands
                                       of the government the easier it is for the officials to control everything
                                       so socialism moves swiftly to communism which is simply perfected - call it
                                       what you will - communism or imperialism.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e14863"></a>This means that after this war Americans should use every possible means to
                                       direct the reorganization of Europe toward the congressional form, and the
                                       basic principle laid down as EQUITY.

                                       of space and so objectionable in construction, have been eliminated. In

                                       of the gridiron, these can easily be eliminated. Each quarter section has
                                       half its streets lined with the cardinal points of the compass and half with
                                       the intermediate compass points so the perpendiculars can easily be

            <p><a name="d0e15083"></a>Chicago has an unusually complete system of Railroads, appropriate to its
                                       central location on the continent, and of diagonal avenues. We have made no
                                       distinction between these except in the matter of the time of construction.
                                       The building lines on them all should be 200 feet apart that they may be
                                       ready for the introduction of depressed central rail lines in the future
                                       when required. In the mean time, on the whole, only the 8 rail Through
                                       Express routes call for the use of all that width for vehicular traffic. All
                                       these thoroughfares should be treed and gardened ways. The evaporation
                                       serves as a very noticeable cooler on hot days.

            <p><a name="d0e15086"></a>On the whole the radial routes, varying in the weight of their service, have
                                       been retained. In only a few places have they been removed. Sometimes there
                                       has been a slight deviation here and there to bring together unnecessarily
                                       close lines thus simplifying the problem of satisfactory occupation. A
                                       surprisingly large area of Chicago is unoccupied. Land value taxation would
                                       put an end to that. We assume that all the latest improvements will be made

                                       surface, or rather depressed service of Railroads will have to be
                                       modernized. At crossings one express should go deeper - under the other.

                                       expenditures but can come with the timely and natural restoration of the
                                       properties involved. The external roads of the quarter and half sections
                                       will be fast traffic but local rather than express so generally the present
                                       widths are sufficient. Passenger traffic here should be buses which can pick
                                       up the passengers at the curb minimizing danger. There may be exceptions to
                                       this where new 200' thoroughfares will be used. The freight trucks should be
                                       so constructed that they can be switched onto Rail lines thus minimizing the
                                       crowding of streets. The problem of the safety of surface traffic at
                                       intersections of thoroughfares has been worked out in Chicago and is being
                                       established by either center circulating parks or over and under ways.

                                       into exterior and interior. The Neighborhood streets, the opposite of
                                       thoroughfares, should be narrow and devious though this does not mean
                                       indirect. No stub ends and no curly streets. Their use will be purely for

            <p><a name="d0e15175"></a>In accordance with the general principle or locating Community Centers, this
                                       center of Metropolitan Chicago is placed where all 8 of the Through Routes
                                       come together. Its location has been indicated diagrammatically. It lies
                                       between Halstead <a name="441"></a> [Note: Halsted Street?] and the Lake and between
                                       Roosevelt Road and 26th Street. Into these 8 routes pour all the railroad
                                       main and branch and belt lines. One can reach it directly from anywhere.
                                       Within this district all the Railroads and Stations will be below grade and
                                       completely floored over. (In Sydney the Railroads of the whole metropolis
                                       are underground, very elegant and offering enough safe and comfortable space
                                       to house close to the whole population of the city in time of war.)
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e15181"></a>This is not a terminal station. All lines are through routes. It is about the
                                       center between the North and South limits of Chicago. The South Side, since
                                       through it pours a stream from the intensely occupied Eastern States, bids
                                       fair soon to become as important as the North Side. It requires only proper
                                       handling within and beyond the City limits to become so. We therefore
                                       suggest the expectation of a Retail Trade and Office development district to
                                       the South comparable to that to the North especially as this South East
                                       region continues to have the Lake Shore. The State line boundary line

            <p><a name="d0e15187"></a>Three Routes come in from the South. The other Through Routes come in from
                                       the West and North. Trade and Office building may naturally extend Northward
                                       in this district beyond the River. Beyond the area to the North of the mouth
                                       of the River along the Lake Shore is, and may well continue to be, the tall
                                       flat building district with a more or less transient occupancy. A similar

            <p><a name="d0e15247"></a>Here, creating a new course for the Chicago River, we have a lock system to
                                       form a series of formal reflecting pools of controlled waters for garden and
                                       architectural effects. Every location and approach would have to be studied
                                       individually along with its surroundings. We do not suggest following any
                                       ancient civilization's forms but the using of America's creative genius
                                       whose fire was lighted by the founder of modern Architecture - Louis
                                       Sullivan. Broad ways with Terminal accents, Theatres, Opera House,
                                       Libraries, Museums, Galleries, Institutions, should gradually be established
                                       in this district - Civic Buildings, Convention Halls, etc. There is plenty
                                       of time for these works to be carried out, fifty years means nothing to a
                                       city so long as it grows right. The gardens might well be Botanical Gardens
                                       with trees and so forth properly labeled. Elsewhere, Australia for instance,
                                       the great cities have magnificent Botanical Gardens in the very heart of the
                                       business centers. Everybody uses them.

            <p><a name="d0e15287"></a>Chicago as a whole is a community which contains within it other communities.
                                       We discuss this as a present and future problem. The present retail and
                                       office building district lies to the North of the proposed Entrance Gate
                                       extending west from the Lake and tending to go beyond the River. The
                                       original difficulties of the site have been overcome and its location at the
                                       confluence of the river with the lake is properly the determining factor of
                                       its location.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e15290"></a>This Central City, free from radial lines is a natural Retail and Office
                                       Building Center. Provision is made for the extension of this central
                                       down-town area by extending it Westward to Halstead <a name="443"></a> [Note: Halsted]
                                       Street. Its business is improved by the intense flat district to the North
                                       and the Entrance Gate on its Southern Boundary and the bringing of all
                                       Through Routes to this Center which is not a terminal station. Much use will
                                       be made of the underground of all this district. The present terminal
                                       stations will remain but as local stops.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e15296"></a>We suggest nothing revolutionary for Chicago's business center. As time goes
                                       on, multiple buildings will be replaced by single buildings occupying a
                                       whole block, with interior courts, etc., and they will tend not to become
                                       higher but to become monumental and beautiful. Open squares will be left so
                                       that the surrounding buildings may be seen to advantage. Such spaces cost
                                       nothing when held by the community. Through this district the river flows
                                       and the property adjacent to it will be held by the community and gradually
                                       the river will be parked <a name="444"></a> [Note: developed into parks?] on either side

            <p><a name="d0e15310"></a>The River within this central city should be entirely freed from anything
                                       that would hamper its stateliness and beauty. It would be well to set
                                       immediately the building line boundaries on either side of the river to
                                       ensure a park along both its sides from 25th Street to its mouth. Rentals
                                       cost the city nothing as they belong to the community as a whole. Where
                                       there are monumental buildings these could be allowed to remain.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e15313"></a>To the South we forecast a similar Retail and Office Building area developing
                                       gradually from the Entrance Gate. Such a district might develop in the two
                                       sections (about a mile southward by two miles from East to West) to the
                                       South though they have been drawn as ordinary residential districts.

            <p><a name="d0e15316"></a>Three of the Express Through Routes (No.1, No.2, and No.3) carry from the
                                       South and the Southwest districts through this district into the
                                       Administrative Center and the Retail Trade and Office District to the North.
                                       The South Side, if properly handled would have a population as profitable to
                                       Chicago as the North districts beyond the City limits are. We begin that by
                                       making Lake Calumet a New Venice.

            <p><a name="d0e15319"></a>The intensely occupied flat district along the Lake to the North can be left
                                       as it is on the whole. It will be occupied by transients or elderly people.
                                       Families with children or young folk will move into the neighboring
                                       districts where life can be full of interest. Apartments will also appear in
                                       the spaces adjacent to thoroughfares.

            <p><a name="d0e15381"></a>Industry from early days took possession of Chicago. It made and it will
                                       destroy it if allowed to be the controlling factor. Chicago should be a
                                       London only <u>modern</u>. London is made up of many separate
                                       municipalities. If Chicago's extension into the lake East of the mouth of
                                       the Calumet River (which perhaps Nature's piling up of the sands might make
                                       possible) is not feasible at least pains should be taken there to form an
                                       enclosed harbor whose outer shore should be park and pleasure ground for the
                                       citizens, restoring to them what industry has destroyed.

            <p><a name="d0e15387"></a>Chicago is a natural Industrial and Commercial Center. Whether it is living
                                       or dying depends upon its citizenry first and the transients secondarily.
                                       The beautiful lake district South and Southeast will attract as high class a
                                       citizenry as have the beauties of the North Shore and should not be
                                       despoiled. There is plenty of room to the west for expending industry but
                                       its expression calls for pre-planning. We take for granted that Chicago will
                                       presently do as other places have done and prevent industry from polluting
                                       either the air or the water. All its by-products can be made use of even the
                                       heat which can be used as in Oak Park <a name="446"></a> [Note: Illinois] for community
                                       hot water systems.

            <p><a name="d0e15393"></a>A FAIRLY GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRIES IS DESIRABLE as it affords
                                       employment to a considerable proportion of the population who should
                                       therefore live as close as possible, and whose standards can and should be
                                       as high as anyone's and whose home environment and opportunities for the
                                       children should be on a level with any other citizen's. This has been the
                                       natural cause of Chicago's growth so we find industry scattered throughout
                                       the Metropolis, and on the whole we have left that as it is as we have also
                                       that of the radial transport system.

            <p><a name="d0e15414"></a>There is endless opportunity for extension of industry to the West. It is no
                                       more important to Chicago that it should be within the municipal limits than
                                       that the North Shore residential districts should be. What is necessary is
                                       that it should be pre-planned, each and every square mile. Each district may
                                       be a particular problem. The successful planning of each district will
                                       contribute to Chicago's development as a continental center.

            <p><a name="d0e15417"></a>The great work of the young people of the 1st decades of the 20th century
                                       gave Chicago a magnificent outer park system of reserves. But this has met
                                       but the one necessity of preserving nature within the community boundaries.
                                       It was done with no town-planning system except the rescue of as many lovely
                                       spots as possible. Its work extended over the State and even beyond. In a
                                       way it was outside the realm of Town Planning as we have defined it - i.e.,
                                       the problem of occupation and communication. Its motive was simply "to the
                                       rescue" of Mother Nature. That must be followed by district planning.

                                       to the domestic Centers. The irregular spaces caused by not having
                                       preplanned the Through Routes could well be used for such purposes and for
                                       tall flats. Manufacturing could also use some of the minor distributive
                                       thoroughfares depending on its nature.

                                       The structure is a series of great circular intersecting arches which
                                       eliminate the dome type of strains. At their lower contact point Griffin
                                       placed the highly ornamental torches, making all the lighting indirect. So
                                       effective was it that the oculist member of the board of directors could no
                                       longer complain when he found that he could read the tiniest print on his
                                       eye testing chart.

            <p><a name="d0e15508"></a>The coloring of the walls and arches of this hall is wonderful. The rough
                                       surface of the intersections add richness, and the varied pattern of the
                                       intersecting arches which could be colored in different shades of gold and
                                       orange and green.

            <p><a name="d0e15511"></a>The design of the whole is a unique thing in the world and though by no means
                                       Gothic holds its own with the beautiful structures of Europe.

                                       Railroads, we have accepted on the whole the through routes. The
                                       intersection points determine the proper location for Community Centers. On
                                       the whole we have chosen those at two or three mile intervals where a Center
                                       one mile long will include two or more different through route intersection
                                       points. Within this area not only will the tracks go underground but the
                                       stations as well. The fact of locating these natural places for concentrated
                                       service will develop a rivalry that will tend to make them all beautiful.
                                       The Community's collecting of rental values will prevent the holding back of
                                       development. The neglect of this in early days was the cause of the

                                       of life and much other damage. Such natural features should be dealt with by

                                       which keep the buildings cool in summer, or for garage or other services.
                                       The development has been suggested diagrammatically though quite possibly it
                                       may be the best way since wriggly roads on flat land are intolerable. On the

                                       private house on a single lot. Whether it should be low lying and set back

                                       communication has been tackled and only half of that - the major
                                       communication lines. No consideration has been given to what should be done
                                       for interior distributive lines. The consequence is that except for the
                                       retail trade and office districts and the occasional large parks, Chicago is
                                       completely slums.

                                       triangle or hexagon - the snowflake with its myriad enchanting forms. What
                                       the adult is depends on what the child has been. Only in proper wholesome
                                       surroundings can one grow up complete, healthy, happy - fully developed in
                                       body, soul and spirit. All other issues are secondary. Only if the problem

                                       occupation except in the location of various isolated parks. These are right
                                       and fine but do not in the least meet the needs of small children and their
                                       parents for daily and hourly use for the thousand and one purposes that the

            <p><a name="d0e15641"></a>It is of first importance that we should eliminate delinquency. The children
                                       should be safe and have wide contact with others while growing up to be
                                       complete and satisfied human beings. In Chicago no attention has been given
                                       to this half of the community problem. The issue is not centralizing or
                                       decentralizing. Even intensely occupied areas may be safe but all the other
                                       requirements should be met too. Even if our domestic units should be crowded
                                       (which we should not permit) they still would be safe for the domestic
                                       functions of children and parents.

            <p><a name="d0e15644"></a>The type pattern set for Quarter and Half Sections sometimes conform to
                                       present quarter-section lines and sometimes are set diagonal to them. In
                                       each case this could be determined by investigation of the particular
                                       district. In all cases the present Quarter Section lines could be retained
                                       if it was found to be important to do so. In no case need the changes within
                                       the Quarter Section lines be revolutionary. We can do as they have done in
                                       Metropolitan Sydney to get rid of the hopeless confusion of traffic on its
                                       narrow streets. There a new building line has been set. When a new building
                                       is erected it must conform to the new line. This entails no extra expense
                                       and really gives added style to the new buildings, attracting attention and
                                       custom. Or we could do as was done several times in Los Angeles - move
                                       buildings on to new lots.

            <p><a name="d0e15647"></a>The ultimate building lines could be set and when present owners decided to
                                       rebuild they could be allocated a new lot on the plan as determined. In many
                                       cases about half of the streets would remain where they are at present, just

            <p><a name="d0e15768"></a>Any scheme of development that is to serve during a considerable period of
                                       time must first be "elastic" to accommodate as many contingencies as can be
                                       predicted. But a development that is to suit the simplest requirements of
                                       modern community life can be neither amorphous nor arbitrary nor with
                                       autocratic restrictions. Its elastic adaptability will not be secure unless
                                       founded on a simple articulation of functions with careful attention to
                                       distinctions that are fundamental and specific, and to correlation that may
                                       be considered of vital organic necessity - generic.
            </p>
                                
            <p><a name="d0e15771"></a>To arrive at these relationships it is necessary not only to study present
                                       civic conditions - failures as well as successes - but to trace their
                                       historical development from our earliest knowledge to ascertain tendencies
                                       that may be expected to affect the future. Thus only can we hope to deal
                                       broadly in generalization without running into mere speculation unrelated to
                                       reality.

                                       Co-operative industrial site requirements are reciprocal with the most

            <p><a name="d0e15798"></a>The general tendency of most of Chicago implies, for the Quarter Section,
                                       adaptation to predominantly residential function. There is, however, an
                                       important modification of the normal considered here as an alternative. This
                                       involves a development in connection with a manufacturing concern to provide
                                       home and social advantages primarily for the employees of the contiguous
                                       works. The most typical additional assumption for that condition would be
                                       railway facilities on one side of the Quarter Section in place of the future
                                       streetcar lines otherwise predicted.

            <p><a name="d0e15801"></a>On the basis of an ultimate population of the Quarter Section, that frontage
                                       - 1280 x 4 or 5120 feet - will doubtless prove excessive as compared with
                                       business frontage in average towns of that population and, accordingly, only
                                       about 5/8 of that frontage conferring transfer points and principal
                                       centerway entrance corners for stores and shops; and less accessible
                                       frontage for supply yards, garages, storehouses, etc.

            <p><a name="d0e15804"></a>Since the traffic point will be the most useful business site it is suggested
                                       that the most general local industries can be accommodated there, beginning
                                       with the existing transfer corner as the first arcade courts structure.
                                       Built full to the street inter-section line such a building will sacrifice
                                       none of the most available shop frontage.

            <p><a name="d0e15807"></a>We must realize that a high organism only will lead to great and real freedom
                                       for artistic expression. For analogy, the whole city may be compared to a
                                       tree with its unified circulating system of industry represented by the
                                       stem, roots and branches, the rootlets and the leaves, all continuous and
                                       constantly interoperating to augment, repair and maintain the system's
                                       integrity. In the great industrial city we have all that now, more or less
                                       efficient, in this way and just as certain to end disastrously if limited to

                                       of 160 acres. With the level land and with other conditions so

                                       generally with the structural elements of the problem and eliminate
                                       non-essential though important variations that would have to be considered
                                       in the event of execution for a particular site. Any scheme of development
                                       that is to be extended over a considerable time must first, because of the
                                       complexities of democratic life, be flexible to accommodate more
                                       contingencies than can be predicted but by no means need it be amorphous as
                                       in the usual "gridiron" nor arbitrary in restrictions as in the German
                                       "Zone" systems. Above all we have to avoid running into speculation outside
                                       of reality. Co-operative <u>industrial</u> site requirements are

                                       become parks as it extends its boundaries, and interests, which are one with
                                       the State, just as the Hikers did a quarter of a century ago. The citizens

                                       streets would leave the thoroughfares at right angles and meet between them
                                       in obtuse angles as desirable for buildings as the right angle, often more
                                       desirable, especially for civic structures. The streets within come into

                                       least the whole state. Surveys should in no case determine the lines of

                                       wind and dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water, and above as to
                                       cooling currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most

                                       planner, saw the amazing possibilities of the three virgin promontories on
                                       the western side of Middle Harbor with their glorious four miles of water
                                       frontage. His enthusiasm inspired a group of Australian capitalists among
                                       his professional clients, and the magnificent amphitheatres passed into the

                                       is not level the contours should become a controlling factor (see Leeton

            <p><a name="d0e16162"></a>Buildings should be as straightforward solutions of their problems as the
                                       layouts of the districts. But this does not mean that they should be stupid
                                       and uninteresting repetitions. No natural beauty should be injured but each
                                       one taken advantage of. Environing established communities should be
                                       considered as centers for express ways and branches to aim toward in order
                                       to connect with the radial roads that start from the various towns. Each
                                       town will of course require special consideration for its growth. All high
                                       speed through traffic should be depressed, open as a whole but covered over
                                       where it concentrates.
