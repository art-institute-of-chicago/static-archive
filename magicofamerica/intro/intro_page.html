<h2>The Magic of America: Electronic Edition</h2>

<p>This section describes the major features of "The Magic of America: Electronic Edition" 
website, provides basic technical information about the project, and lists significant 
changes made to the Digital Text and the Image Database.</p>

<h3>Website</h3>

<p>"The Magic of America," a typescript of over 1,400 pages with approximately 650 accompanying 
illustrations, was written and compiled by Marion Mahony Griffin (1871-1961), architect, designer, 
delineator, and artist. In 1911 she married Walter Burley Griffin (1876-1937), architect, 
landscape designer, and city planner.  Their architectural practice spanned almost four decades 
on three continents, and "The Magic of America" was meant, in part, to be a testament to their 
life and work together.</p>

<p>"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition" collates in a digital format all the texts and 
illustrations from the three known copies of the work. The electronic edition thus represents 
the most complete and accessible version currently available of this important architectural 
document. Comments are welcome.</p>

<ul><strong>Notes on Searching the Digital Text :</strong> 
Because of the length of the original document, the electronic edition is divided into four separate 
files, corresponding to the four Sections of the text. If using a web browser, each of the four files 
or Sections must be searched separately with the browser's search tool. A single PDF file of all four 
Sections combined is available for download under 
<a href="../supplementa_frameset/supplementa_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Supplementa</strong></a>. 
This version may be searched using the search tool found in 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/" target="_top"><strong>Adobe Reader</strong></a>. Because 
of spelling variations in the text (e.g., "bed room," "bed-room," 
"bedroom"), try different possible spellings for search terms as well as a stem or root of the term. 
In the Digital Text all apostrophes and quotation marks appear as "straight" quotes (i.e., " or ' ).

<h3>Technical Summary</h3>

<p>"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition" is a project of the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries of 
The Art Institute of Chicago.  The Digital Text is based on the two copies (AIC1, AIC2) of "The 
Magic of America" (MoA) at the Art Institute.  Any missing or additional text was transcribed from 
the New-York Historical Society's copy (N-YHS) of MoA. Illustrations have been scanned from N-YHS and 
sequenced within the text according to that copy.  (See the sections on 
<a href="#archival"><b>archival texts</b></a> and <a href="#procedures"><b>editorial procedures</b></a>, 
below, for more information about these topics.)</p>

<p>Prior to this project a microfilm of MoA, derived from AIC2 (for Section I) and AIC1 (for Sections II-IV), 
had been produced for the Art Institute.  From this microfilm an OCR (optical character recognition) file was 
made and converted into a Microsoft Word file (Version 11.3.5).</p>

<p>The MSWord file was then edited and marked-up in TEI/XML (Text Encoding Initiative/Extensible Markup Language), 
following TEI's "Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange" (P4; 2002) and other helpful sources 
like Lou Burnard and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen's <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/teiu5_en.html" target="_top"><b>"TEI Lite: 
An Introduction to Text Encoding for Interchange"</b></a> (2002).  The MSWord file was then transferred, as a "Text Only" 
document, into oXygen XML Editor 6.2 where further editing and markup was done.</p> 

<p>Using oXygen's "Configure transformation scenario" TEI HTML option, the TEI/XML was then "transformed" 
into an HTML (hypertext markup language) document for Web access. Because of the length of MoA and difficulties 
in translating XML tags through the transformation process into HTML, only the most basic TEI/XML tag sets were 
used (e.g., figure, lb, note, p, pb, and occasionally bibl).  With regard to structure, the four Sections of 
MoA represent first level divisions (div1); title pages, tables of contents, frontispieces, prefaces or 
introductions, and "No.'s" (i.e., chapters) are treated as second level divisions (div2).</p>

<p>Text and illustration pages were scanned at 600 dpi (dots per inch) with 24-bit color. The images 
exist as archived TIFF (tagged image file format) images, with one or more JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts 
Group) versions for general use and "thumbnail" GIFs (graphic interchange format) for the Digital Text.</p>

<p>Major scanning of the text and illustration pages was completed by 2006/2007. Initial TEI/XML mark-up 
occurred during 2006. Work on the "The Magic of America: Electronic Edition" was officially completed in 
August 2007.</p>

<h3>Citations and Linking</h3>

<p>Given Griffin's complex pagination system, a new numbering sequence was devised for the electronic edition 
consisting of section and page sequence numbers. A Roman numeral indicating the section number was kept, 
followed by a period and an Arabic numeral indicating the page number within that section. This pagination 
is labeled "Page Citation #" and can be found in the upper right-hand corner of every page within the 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_001_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Manuscript 
Facsimile</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Since this site uses frames, it can be difficult to determine the URL of specific pages within it. To remedy this issue, 
Page URL buttons have been placed in the upper right-hand corner of every page to assist those creating citatations 
or links to individual pages within the site. Clicking on the Page URL button of any given page will 
display the URL needed to reach that content.</p>

<p>Although there are numerous ways to cite web-based content, the examples below have been created using

<h3>Description and History</h3> 

<ul class="none">
<h4>General Description</h4>

<p>"The Magic of America" (MoA) by Marion Mahony Griffin (MMG) is a typescript of about 1,400 pages with 
approximately 650 accompanying illustrations.  Currently three copies of the work are known to exist: two 
(AIC1, AIC2) at the Art Institute of Chicago and one (N-YHS) at the New-York Historical Society. (In editorial 
annotations MMG makes reference to a number of "sets" and even to an "original.")  Microfilm is available 
for both the N-YHS and AIC copies.</p>

<p>The N-YHS copy [MssColl BV Griffin, Marion Mahony] is fastened into eight Accopress binders. The illustrations 
have been stapled onto sheets of paper and interleaved with the typescript text. The New-York Historical Society 
also has a <a href="../supplementa/moa_scrapbook.pdf" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Scrapbook</strong></a> of newspaper 
clippings from 1914-1924 about Walter Burley Griffin's work at Canberra. Of 
The Art Institute of Chicago copies [R&B Libraries 1949.1], AIC1 lacks the first of the four Sections (i.e., volumes) 
into which MoA is divided but has an almost complete set of the three remaining Sections; AIC2 has a complete first 
Section, but the remaining Sections are much more fragmentary than those of AIC1. The Art Institute copies are unbound, 
and the illustrations are in separate portfolios.  The Art Institute also has complete copies of a number of brochures 
and pamphlets, some of whose images are found in MoA.</p>

<p>Three factors suggest N-YHS is a later version of MoA than the Art Institute copies: N-YHS is provisionally bound; 
its illustrations are interfiled with the typescript; and its text sometimes corrects errors or amends wording found 
in AIC1 and AIC2. Though basically very similar across almost fourteen hundred pages of text, N-YHS, AIC1, and AIC2 
do differ in detail.  Each has text and illustrations lacking in the other&#151;evidence of the author's continuing editing 
process.  MoA appears never to have been completely finished.</p>

<h4>Organization</h4>

<p>MoA is divided into four "Sections" (referred to as "Volumes" in N-YHS) containing both text and illustrations. 
Sections contain: a title page (or pages); table of contents; frontispiece portrait of Walter Burley Griffin (WBG), 
sometimes with accompanying text; a preface or introduction (in Sections I-III); and a set of individually titled "No." 
(Numbers, called "Chapters" in N-YHS).  Especially useful as a general guide or outline for each Section are the tables 
of contents, which are as much a listing of illustrations as of written texts.  At a number of points, however, the 
tables of contents do not exactly reflect the contents of the typescript.  There may, for example, be differences between 
the page number given in the table of contents and the pagination on the page of text itself; a number of illustrations are 
found in the typescript but are not listed in the table of contents.</p>

<p>The four Sections broadly follow the same format. Section I, however, differs from the other three in being shorter, in 
indicating in many instances that an illustration (usually without a "caption") should be inserted within a page of text, 
and in ending one chapter and beginning another on the same page.  These last two features disappear in the remaining 
Sections: illustrations for the most part are kept on separate pages and each chapter begins on a new page. In comparison 
to the first three Sections, Section IV seems more ragged and fragmentary, a sign perhaps that it was more hastily constructed 
than the others. In this Section chapters vary widely in length, illustrations are missing, and pagination is often 
inconsistent.</p>

<h4>Pagination</h4>

<p>As many as three different page numbers can be found on any one page of text. One set of numbers&#151;usually proceeding 
sequentially from "1"&#151;must represent the initial transcription of originally separate and discrete materials, e.g., 
articles, presentations, essays.  The other sets of numbers probably indicate the arrangement and rearrangement of 
these individual items into larger groupings&#151;the higher page number signifying a later version.  From this perspective 
MoA can be seen as a careful compiling or assembling of a large number of individual "set pieces."</p>

<h4>Document Types</h4>

<p>The types of documents found in MoA are many and varied: materials from all aspects of the Griffins' 
professional and private lives are included.  Personal correspondence is frequently quoted.  Articles 
from newspapers and magazines by individuals other than the Griffins (usually with incomplete bibliographic 
citations) are reproduced. Much material appearing in MoA attributed to the Griffins themselves (usually 
with no citation) was probably published in popular magazines or professional journals.  WBG's preliminary 
general plan for Canberra, an Australian government publication, is included in MoA, and MMG abstracts 
testimony from the Royal Commission investigating the work at Canberra.  Selections of poetry and from 
plays are also quoted.  Along with these more formal document types are more ephemeral kinds of writing. 
Many seemingly occasional pieces were probably originally talks or public presentations.  Planning 
statements for unbuilt projects as well as reports and analyses of completed work figure prominently in 
MoA. Finally, there are MMG's reminiscences of her own childhood and adult experiences as well as her essays, 
often highly polemical, on various topics.</p>

<p>The illustrations in MoA are as diverse as the written materials. The work contains approximately 650 
illustrations selected to accompany the almost 1,400 pages of text. The illustrations include photographic 
reproductions and reductions of architectural drawings and plans as well as drawings and photographs published 
in newspapers, magazines, journals, and brochures.  Many of these illustrations retain a portion of the original 
text that was published with them. In addition to architectural subjects MoA includes pictures of landscapes, 
Australian flora, and individual people.<p>

<p>Aside from "copies" and published materials, MoA also has a number of "original" items: chiefly professional 
photographs (made, perhaps, in preparation for magazine publication), private snapshots, and, especially in 
Section IV, architectural renderings in pencil on tracing paper and some watercolors of MMG's All Souls Church. 
Other original materials include: the cablegram announcing WBG as the winner of the Canberra competition, a note 
from the Australian writer Miles (Stella) Franklin, old family photographs on pasteboard backing, an architectural 
rendering in ink on a satin-like fabric, and the pen and ink drawings accompanying the text of "Trees" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_370_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.370</b></a> ff). (For 
more information about the illustrations, see the 
<a href="#introduction"><b>introduction to the Image Database</b></a>.)</p>

<p>In the New-York Historical Society copy the illustrations, as a rule, are stapled onto 8.5" x 11" sheets of 
previously used paper and interleaved with the typescript.  This "scrap" paper consists of such things as the 
back of form letters from Lake Forest College (and some Castlecrag letterhead) and (early?) outlines of the 
arrangement of text and photos for MoA.  While many of the illustrations fit within the dimensions of the page, 
a significant number are larger than the sheet and have been folded at least once to accommodate a standard page 
size.</p>

<p>In addition to two typescripts of MoA, the Art Institute of Chicago received a collection of approximately 
250 illustrations along with four real estate development brochures for Castlecrag and Mossmain (Montana). 
These materials appear to have been separate from the typescript and had not been integrated into the text 
as they are in the New-York Historical Society copy.  Many of the Art Institute illustrations are the same 
as or very similar to those from New York, though they generally lack the scrap paper backing found in the 
Society's copy.  A small number of the Chicago images, however, are not found in the New York copy and 
represent unique items.  The Chicago collection may be the original source for both duplicate and rejected 
images from which illustrations were drawn for MoA.</p>

<h4>Subject Matter</h4>

<p>The major emphasis is on the Griffins' architectural work from 1913 to 1937, from WBG's winning the capital 
design competition in Australia to his death in India.  Architectural work before and after this period is 
also included as well as much material on MMG's private life.  Because MMG, like WBG, believed that architecture 
had aesthetic, social, environmental, educational, philosophical, and even spiritual implications, the range of 
subjects covered in MoA can be very broad&#151;focusing primarily on architecture, but also ranging from speculations 
on the "formative forces" of the physical world to the best ways to organize human society.</p>

<h4>Typescript History</h4>

<p>MoA was most likely compiled and written between MMG's return to the United States in 1938 and the donations 
of the typescripts and illustrations to the New-York Historical Society and Art Institute of Chicago in 1949. 
(At that time MMG also gave some of her architectural and art work to Northwestern University and the Avery 
Architectural Library at Columbia University.)  The period also coincides with the death of MMG's sister, 
Georgine, and the assistance MMG was giving her recently widowed niece, Clarmyra (Georgine's daughter), in 
raising her young children.<p>

<p>Some scattered evidence about the genesis of MoA can be found in the William Gray Purcell Papers at the 
Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota (cited hereafter as Purcell Papers). Purcell had 
been a close friend of Walter Burley Griffin since at least the beginning of their careers. On 29 April 
1942 MMG wrote Purcell that her ". . . main interest is in putting together a sort of account of Walt's 
work."  Doubting she would have the money to publish this account, she then describes it as "[t]hree volumes 
is the form in which I am at present handling it, one semi-autobiographical, one Canberra and Town Planning, 
the other An American Architect's Year in India." By 4 January 1947 she tells him the work is in four volumes 
(the form now found in all existing copies) and that "[Section] I - The Empirial Battle (that is the way I want 
it spelt)" is complete and the other volumes "nearing completion." On 10 April 1947 she writes Purcell that she 
is ready to send him "Vol. II - The Federal Battle."  There appears to be no further information relating to 
the composition of MoA in the remaining correspondence.  Internal references in the text itself also suggest 
that much newly written material comes from around the mid 1940s.  The latest datable reference in the work 
is the inclusion (AIC1, AIC2) of a quotation from Charles Lindbergh published in September, 1948 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_014_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.14</b></a>).  
Though relating earlier events, much of MoA, it should be remembered, was compiled, written, and edited in 
the 1940s by a woman who was then in her 70s.</p>

<h3>Overview and Commentary</h3>

<p>In March 1915, Marion Mahony Griffin (MMG) wrote to some of her MIT classmates, "Am doing so much writing 
of one kind or another that I have taken to the type-writer. I know it will be a relief not to have to puzzle 
over my writing. Though I am far from being an expert with the machine it is very much easier than writing and, 
I think, faster even with the short practice that I have had." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_048_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.48</b></a>)  She had 
begun to master a technology 
which, several decades later, would allow her to efficiently (and legibly) transcribe the great mass of material 
that would serve to tell the story of the life and work of Walter Burley Griffin and of herself.  On 10 April 
1947 MMG wrote to William Gray Purcell, ". . . my idea in arranging these books - for there are four altogether - 
is that I (who have no particular interest in literature) want to get Walter's Architecture and Town Planning 
concepts before the general public by hook or by crook. . . . I want these seed[s] he has scattered to reach 
the earth so that they may take root and grow in the immediate future for truly man's existence on this earth 
in the coming decades is seriously threatened." (Purcell Papers)</p>

<h4>General Structure</h4>

<p>The division of the work into four "books" or "Sections" is the fundamental organizational principle of MoA. 
Section I, "The Empirial Battle or an American Architect's Year in India," comprises the period from WBG's trip 
there in late 1935 to his death in early 1937; Section II, "The Federal Battle," and Section III, "The Municipal 
Battle," deal respectively with the Australian experience, the design and construction of the capital of Canberra 
(1913-1920) and the development of the residential community of Castlecrag (the 1920s through the mid 1930s); 
Section IV, "The Individual Battle," covers the Griffins' early lives and careers in Illinois and the Midwest 
(before 1913).  The narrative, then, generally moves backward in time.  But this reverse chronology is never 
strictly observed: text and illustrations from all periods may appear anywhere in MoA, just as the most diverse 
topics may be introduced at any point.  The "subject" of each Section serves as an important focal point, but 
also as a point of departure for more broad-ranging discussions.  Such a heterogeneous and protean work resists 
straightforward summary.</p>

<ul class="none">
<p><em><strong>Section I</strong></em></p>

<p>Section I, "The Empirial Battle," WBG's "year" in India, seems always to have been a part of MMG's conception 
of MoA. (See the Griffin-Purcell correspondence mentioned above.)  She wrote of the time, "Then came that last 
year. Again the busy cram-ful years seemed like leisure days in the light of this driving year into which was 
crowded a life's experience and a life's work," 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_018_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.18</b></a>) and 
later "[t]he full flowering of his [WBG's] work came 
in the last year of his life . . ." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_062_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.62</b></a>).  At 
the beginning of the volume MMG is in Australia and WBG in 
India (she would join him in the spring of 1936).  Much of the Section I is epistolary: exchanges between MMG 
and WBG and letters to and from others.  MMG recounts news and cultural events from Castlecrag (the subjects 
of drama and children will receive much greater attention in Section III), while WBG reports on his impressions 
of and work in India.</p>

<p>Considerable space is given to WBG's designs for the United Provinces (of Agra and the Oudh, now Uttar Pradesh) 
Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition.  WBG's essay on "Architecture in India" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_260_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.260</b></a> ff) offers an interesting 
interpretation of the history of world architecture and is illustrated by MMG with structures from the Exposition. 
There is also material on WBG's projects for several maharajas, his difficulties with the Lucknow University Library 
commission, and his work for the Pioneer Press Office and Works.  He writes on seeing the Taj Mahal, "To me this 
was no less breath-taking than to any devotee who has ever sung its praises, and quite independent of the fact 
that, architecturally, I could see many things that should have been altogether different." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_049_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.49</b></a>)  Both the 
Griffins believed in reincarnation.  Reflecting on a possible previous rebirth, WBG observes, "My physical 
appearance does not suggest much of the Indian but I have a hunch that much of my architectural predilections 
must have come from Indian experience. This does not mean that the environment here provides satisfaction so much 
as that it provides stimulus and motifs for satisfactory imagination." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_067_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.67</b></a>)  Throughout 
the volume the Griffins 
show a keen appreciation of Indian architecture and are remarkably open to Indian culture, both Islamic and Hindu.</p>

<p>Still, in the midst of all the activity in Section I, there is a persistent strain of tragedy&#151;the sudden, unexpected 
deaths of Anna Ickes, MMG's childhood friend; of Charles Morton, a child at Castlecrag; and of Ronald Craig, a 
journalist and WBG's guide in India.  This series of losses will culminate in WBG's own death in a hospital in India. 
Having just finished a rendering of a library for the Raja of Mahmudabad (and three days before her birthday), MMG 
saw WBG for the last time.</p>

<p><i>Toward the end his mind wandered and he talked swiftly but all about his work, calculations, demanding answers 
and when I gave him figures he heard me for he took them up and went on from there. And then quiet again. As the end 
drew near I talked to him telling him what a wonderful life I had had with him, how he was beloved by everybody, and 
suddenly he turned as if with a great effort and looked straight in my eyes, his own wide, round, startled as if it 
had never once occurred to him that he could die. His eyes never left mine till he drew his last breath and I closed 
them.</i> (<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_299_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.299</b></a>)</p>

<p><em><strong>Section II</strong></em></p>

<p>Section II, "The Federal Battle," while also including letters, seems much more documentary than Section I, and 
contains materials ranging from published reviews of the Griffins' work to project planning reports to extracts from 
Australian government publications.  WBG had won the international competition to design Australia's new federal 
capital, and, as the Section's subtitle suggests, there is extensive treatment of his conflicts with government 
officials over the planning and construction of Canberra.  The heart of the Section is WBG's 1913 "Preliminary 
General Plan" for the capital 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_187_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.187</b></a> ff) and 
the 1916/17 report of the Royal Commission investigating problems with 
the work there (chiefly <a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_267_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.267</b></a> ff).  
MMG believed that the conclusions of the latter fully vindicated the vision of 
the former.  A number of essays by WBG are reproduced, including two on "Architecture" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_438_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.438</b></a> ff and 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_461_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.461</b></a> ff). 
Also discussed are individual buildings like the Capitol Theatre (1924), Cafe Australia (1915-16), and Newman College 
(1915-18) as well as planning projects in Australia (Griffith, Leeton, University of Sydney) and the US (Emory Hills, 
Grinnell, Idalia).  MMG even includes two of her planning proposals from the early 1940s, the World Fellowship Center 
(New Hampshire) and Hill Crystals-Rosary Crystals (Texas).</p>

<p>Section II also contains some of MMG's harshest criticism of bureaucracy and parliamentary government and of 
Australian attitudes toward class and non-Australians.  To her mind the "permanent officialdom" of the civil 
service is the real power in parliamentary regimes, a force which actually controls the system of elected 
officials. She and WBG ascribed their many difficulties at Canberra to the government bureaucracy. MMG herself 
describes several brushes with a conservative Australian society, most notably in her attempts to "democratize," 
i.e., expand the role of women in, the Sydney Town Planning Association.</p>

<p>But there are lighter moments in this Section, too.  MMG composes a satirical ballad, "A History of the Federal 
Capital in Verse," based on an old folksong, which chronicles the troubles at Canberra. 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_243_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.243-244</b></a>)  She also 
describes her and her husband's experiences at Pholiota ("The Mushroom"), a one-room house they built in Heidelberg, 
a suburb of Melbourne.  She writes that here was "the one moment of pure romance in our lives" in "this first home 
of our own." The Section ends with MMG visiting Canberra after WBG's death and concluding that his vision for the 
capital has survived&#151;or as expressed in her satirical poem, "And now we are sure we can rest content [/] 'Twill be 
well with the mission on which we're sent."</p>

<p><em><strong>Section III</strong></em></p>

<p>Section III, "The Municipal Battle," deals with Castlecrag, the residential community developed by the Griffins 
in Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s. Visually, the Section is dominated by the depictions of various Australian 
trees, the "initial" illustrations beginning each chapter.  Derived in part from the so-called "Forest Portraits" 
and work inspired by a trip MMG took to Tasmania in 1918/19, the drawings are accompanied by colorful, and at 
times even lyrical, "captions."  (See also the Griffins' remarkable photographs of Australian trees in the online 
"Pictures Catalogue" of the National Library of Australia's Eric Milton Nicholls Collection.)  Nature, its beauty and 
its preservation, is a recurring motif in this Section. Along with a selection of WBG's "essays" on architecture 
in general, there are specific pieces by him on "Continental Preservation," "Plants," and "Avenue Trees." While MMG 
continues her attacks on the "Bureau-Crazy" and her recommendations for reorganizing society, there are also numerous 
reflections on nature. In "Beginnings" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_083_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.83</b></a> ff), an 
essay which foreshadows similar passages in Section IV, 
she chronicles her childhood explorations of the natural world in Hubbard Woods, Illinois.  MMG also expresses 
considerable regard for the capacities, knowledge, and wisdom of Australia's indigenous people.</p>

<p>The "high class" residential suburb of Castlecrag represents for MMG the successful incorporation of nature 
and the human community to the benefit of both.  In the Section's descriptions of Castlecrag, some drawn from 
promotional materials and journalists' articles, the blending of nature and architecture is emphasized: the scenic 
physical setting of the development, the natural design and building materials of the houses, the non-invasive 
construction of the roadways and other routes, and the setting aside of "reserves" or parks.  Considerable 
stress is also placed, largely from MMG's personal experiences, on the activities of the community, both social 
(parties, entertaining) and cultural (music, dance, and drama).  The closing part of Section III, one of the 
longest in all MoA, is the text of a drama, "Mirrabooka," written by two young women from Castlecrag. The play, 
itself an echo of the end of "Faust Part II" reproduced earlier 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_326_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.326</b></a> ff), 
unites many of the motifs of 
Section III: architecture and landscape (as a stage setting), community (as both audience and actors), and 
"spiritual knowledge" (Anthroposophic and aboriginal).</p>

<a name="section4"></a>
<p><em><strong>Section IV</strong></em></p>

<p>"Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as well as our greatest agonies," 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_359_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.359</b></a>) wrote MMG, 
and she now turns her attention to the United States in Section IV, "The Individual Battle," the last volume 
of MoA. MMG had returned to the US after almost twenty-five years abroad, and the Section itself contains 
much of MMG's own and her family's experience in America.  This personal and family history, spanning three 
generations, is presented more or less chronologically throughout various chapters of the Section, which is 
enlivened by a number of poems by MMG's father, Jeremiah.  The biographical material, actually begun in 
Section III with "Beginnings" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_083_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.83</b></a> ff) and 
"Reminiscences" (<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_182_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.182</b></a> ff), 
now continues with "Biography" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_106_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.106</b></a> ff), 
"Male &amp; Female He Created Them" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_145_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.145</b></a> ff), 
"Thinking" (<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_161_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.161</b></a> ff), 
and "American Bourgeoisie All Inclusive" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_276_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.276</b></a> ff).  
Stories of family members and friends predominate, and there are clear similarities 
among the communities of Tremont, MMG's maternal grandparents' home, Hubbard Woods, MMG's childhood home, and 
Castlecrag.</p>

<p>The reminiscences conclude with the "Autobiography of Xantippi [Xanthippe]" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_303_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.303</b></a> ff), actually an account 
of WBG's and her canoeing trips, before and after their marriage, along the waterways around Chicago.  Casting 
herself as Xanthippe, the shrewish wife of Socrates, MMG:</p>

<p><i>. . . with the wisdom of the serpent, suggested one day that they</i> [WBG and she] <i>buy together a canoe and 
explore some of the nearby streams. Little did she know what she was in for as a consequence of that innocent 
remark. Like the ancestors of her own family Socrates was, in every domain of life, an adventurer and thrilled 
with the idea of pioneering. She had simply been aware of the fact that men are dependent creatures and felt 
that if Socrates got used to being with her the need of her would grow in him. But he immediately saw worlds 
to discover and conquer and then and there their doom was sealed. She watched him in amazement as she did for 
the rest of their lives. He hadn't in the least made up his mind to marry her (though she had and that perhaps 
made a difference) but that was of no importance and could not for a moment be allowed to stand in the way of 
the undertaking for undertaking it was - to rediscover domains in the same pristine state of loveliness as in 
centuries gone . . .</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_303_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.303-304</b></a>)</p>

<p>Along with the sometimes arduous adventures of canoeing, scenes are described of great natural beauty as well 
as of industrial pollution.  The passage ends with MMG threatening not to help WBG if he does not start work on 
the plans for Canberra.  "And Socrates said nothing (He was such an amiable man) but started sawing wood. Oh my, 
Oh my, And so a new adventure was started." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_323_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.323</b></a>)</p>

<p>The emphasis in this Section is on WBG's American work, but MMG, along with her general opinions on architecture 
and social organization, offers two glimpses of her own work in architecture and art education.  She includes nine 
renderings of her Church of All Souls (Evanston, Illinois, 1903/4; demolished), which she inadvertently calls 
"Unity Church," and a brief account of her relationship with the clients 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_182_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.182-183</b></a>).  
Her views on art 
education for children are expressed in three passages: Bertha Nicholls's "Drawing Lessons" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_251_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.251</b></a> ff), and 
MMG's own "With the Fairies" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_256_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.256</b></a> ff) and 
"Trees" (<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_370_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.370</b></a> ff), 
the last with illustrations.  WBG's 
architectural ideas, opinions, and principles are represented, but there are also essays by both the Griffins 
on additional topics like color, textures and forms, and interior furnishings.</p>

<p>Discussions of various town planning projects (e.g., Mason City, New Trier) lead to the presentation of 
two plans for the city of Chicago: WBG's plan (sometimes referred to as "Newton Center" or the "Newton Quarter 
Section") for the City Club of Chicago's competition in 1913/14 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_381_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.381</b></a> ff) and 
what was probably MMG's 
entry in the Chicago Herald American's Better Chicago Contest in 1945 (IV. No. 19-27, with digressions) which 
she calls "How to Bring Health to Chicago."  MMG's plan seems very much a re-application for post-war Chicago 
of the ideas of WBG from three decades earlier&#151;a final affirmation of her belief that lessons from the past 
can and should be applied to the present.  The last illustration in MoA is of a "Ravine Dwelling . Castlecrag," 
her striking rendering which recalls not only her commitment to nature and architecture but also her own childhood 
experiences in the ravines of Hubbard Woods.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Narrative Techniques</h4>

<p>While MoA may seem like a vast assemblage or collage, it is also clear that the set pieces have been carefully 
arranged to provide variety for what is a very long text. MoA maintains a constant alternation and interplay between 
the personal and professional, the public and private, and the practical and theoretical.  On 4 January 1947 MMG 
wrote to William Gray Purcell (Purcell Papers) of MoA: "I decided suddenly to combine the gossipy biography with 
the technical material. I am sure that is the only way to get them [the texts] read, even by the profession." 
The wide range of document types, the frequent shifts in time and place, the succession of topics&#151;all add 
movement and interest to the text. Contributing no less to this effect is the relationship of the text and 
illustrations. There can be no doubt that the latter were of paramount importance to MMG. In a letter of 10 
April 1947 (Purcell Papers), MMG writes of MoA: "What is valuable in architecture cannot be put in words. It 
must hit the eye. I would not mind if noone [no one] read the book through if they looked at the pictures. Tell 
me how those pictures can reach a wide audience."  Sometimes the illustrations are accompanied by explanatory 
captions, sometimes they are not.  It is often left to the reader to interpret how the text may elucidate the 
images and how the images might illuminate the text.</p>

<p>MoA ties together this panoply of texts and illustrations not through a strictly chronological narrative, 
but by what in rhetoric has been termed "repetition with variation."  At times the repetition is quiet literal, 
but generally MMG takes themes and approaches them again and again from different perspectives. Among the many 
themes that unite MoA, three merit special mention: architecture and planning, nature, and children (particularly 
their early upbringing and education).</p>

<h4>Architecture and Town Planning, Nature, Children</h4>

<p>"Town Planning and Architecture Cannot be Practiced Separately" appears on the title pages of several 
Sections in MoA.  MMG writes, "Planning must include a totality, from a continent to the tiniest unit, 
a single home in relation to its neighbors" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_083_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.83</b></a>) 
or, approaching the problem from the opposite 
perspective, "Town Planning Begins with One Lot" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_025_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.25</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_422_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.422</b></a>).  
"Town Planning is a very broad 
concept. It may call for the perfect solution for a single lot or for any other unit such as municipality, 
state, continent or world." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_027_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.27</b></a>)  
For the Griffins the single unified activity of architecture and 
planning proceeds along a grand continuum and can express a society's (and a civilization's) values. The 
texts in MoA move easily between discussions of single structures and large-scale planning projects.</p>

<p>A reverence for nature pervades the text and many of the illustrations of MoA. The subject figures in 
both the Griffins' leisure activities and professional practice: from the canoe trips around Chicago and 
"tramps" around Castlecrag to their keen interest in botany, from their ideas about site planning and 
building construction to their detailed plans for landscape plantings. Nature serves as a source of 
beauty in itself and as an inspiration for the imagination of the artist (and architect). WBG believes 
the object of Design is "to harmonize Art with Nature" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_237_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.237</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_239_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>239</b></a>), and 
attention to natural setting 
is emphasized in all the Griffins' planning projects and particularly highlighted in the discussions of 
Castlecrag. The Griffins were intensely aware of the threat to the environment by modern development and 
insisted on the protection and preservation of the natural landscape and the creation of "reserves" (parks) 
for local residents. MMG in particular saw nature as "that greatest of teachers" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_147_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.147</b></a>), 
especially of 
children.  She describes Hubbard Woods, her childhood home, as "paradise" and as "God's university" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_085_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.85</b></a>; 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_147_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.147</b></a>).</p>  

<p>The Griffins had no children, but children, their reactions to the world and stories about them, are 
found throughout MoA. MMG especially was concerned about their upbringing and the non-formal aspects of 
their education. She gives much advice to others about raising children, but at the core of her thinking 
is the necessity of children having "open spaces" in the form of both nature and playgrounds. Her views 
are anecdotally expressed in her "adventures in misguiding" her niece, Alstan, and the neighborhood 
children at Castlecrag 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_138_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.138</b></a> ff), 
and find more formal expression in her examples of art instruction 
based on the appreciation of natural forms (see 
<a href="#section4"><b>"Section IV"</b></a> above).</p>

<p>These themes of children, nature, and architecture and planning merge in MMG's thinking:</p>

<p><i>The end, our aim, is to find a way to cure our sick civilization, to make it possible for our 
communities to function wholesomely, free from disease. This cannot be done unless we have a properly 
organized community. And this cannot be attained unless our children are properly educated. This is 
not possible unless all the children have access to nature, natural continuous contact throughout 
childhood - all of them. Otherwise they cannot develop inventive or creative powers to say nothing of 
health. . . . To give the children this is not possible without community planning which facilitates 
decentralization, puts an end to overcrowded cities and an end to wide open spaces too sparsely 
occupied. It interlaces the urban and the rural.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_420_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.420-421</b></a>)</p>

<h4>The Four Ethers and The Threefold Commonwealth</h4>

<p>Mention should also be made of two of MMG's "beliefs" or "theories" that are frequently referenced 
in the work but never systematically explicated: the Four Ethers and the Threefold Commonwealth. The Four 
Ethers&#151;Warmth, Light, Sound, Magnetism&#151;are the four "formative forces" which constitute the physical world. 
The discussion of the Pyrmont Incinerator 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_439_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.439</b></a> ff) is 
the clearest example of the application of these 
ideas to architectural decoration.  The Threefold Commonwealth&#151;the Abilities, Economic, and Political 
"organs"&#151;represents for MMG the structures by which society should be organized to allow individuals to 
realize their potential. The Four Ethers explain the processes of the physical world; the Threefold 
Commonwealth is an ideal which serves as a critique of contemporary society.  The smashing of the atom, 
which revealed the world to be made of ether-like "forces," and the establishment of the United Nations, 
which was developing organizational structures similar to the Threefold Commonwealth, gave MMG hope that 
these ideas or theories would be more widely accepted. (See the 
<a href="../supplementa_frameset/supplementa_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Supplementa</strong></a> 
section for a more detailed description of these two topics.)</p>

<h4>Attitudes and Opinions</h4>

<p>Certainly the story of MoA is told from a definite point of view: the interpretation of events is unfailingly 
favorable to the Griffins. Canberra, for example, is presented from only one side of the issue, and other 
difficulties (e.g., legal, financial) are often only briefly alluded to or not mentioned at all. If the 
Griffins' work seems never to be entirely successful, the rightness of their views appears always to be 
confirmed in the end. Moreover, in as long a work as MoA is, many interesting topics are left tantalizingly 
vague, e.g., the Griffins' belief in Anthroposophy, their adherence to the Single Tax program, the personal 
networks (social, architectural, political) in which they took an active role, and, most disappointingly, 
the full reasons for MMG's departure from India and then Australia.</p>

<p>As one would expect in a work whose every volume title contains the word "Battle," MoA is marked by 
strong antipathies. These antagonisms (some stemming from Progressive Era America) include the Parliamentary 
system and governmental bureaucracy, destruction of the environment, social class structures, colonialism, 
nationalism, militarism, racism, contemporary educational methods, certain architectural trends, materialism, 
dirt and vermin, and Frank Lloyd Wright. It could be argued, however, that MMG approaches these topics more 
in a spirit of anger than of hatred. These antipathies are treated as obstacles to be overcome, as examples 
of ignorance and self-interest to be dispelled when people are shown the correct path. And the right alternative 
is always at hand, whether it is the Congressional system and democracy instead of Parliamentary government 
and the civil service or the work of Louis Sullivan's "successor," WBG, rather than that of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
As MMG writes to her niece, Clarmyra, "There are always two points of view - one right. It is of vital 
importance that one should familiarize oneself with both and take upon himself the responsibility of 
deciding which is right." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_260_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.260</b></a>)</p>

<p>In MMG's efforts to present the most important ideas and the broadest perspective, a certain accuracy 
in detail is sometimes lost. Names, for example, are often misspelled or variously spelled; titles can 
often be inaccurate; and full bibliographic citations to published materials are lacking. But MMG is 
scrupulous in MoA in always attributing to others&#151;though often without full detail&#151;any work which is 
not by her husband or herself.  She writes that in architecture, "I would grant that what one likes one 
can use . . . but cannot claim." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_092_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.92</b></a>)  This 
distinction is maintained throughout MoA and is fundamental 
to her criticism of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
(e.g., <a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_062_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.62</b></a>)</p>

<p>The architectural ideas presented in MoA show no kind of historical development. This apparent lack of 
evolution in WBG's thinking may be due in part to MMG's belief that in town planning and architecture "he was 
functioning before he left high school. . . . The first city plan he laid down was for a Chinese client for 
China [ca. 1906; see 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_059_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.59</b></a>]. The 
underlying principles were clearly established here . . ." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_016_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.16</b></a>) 
Of the principles of the Canberra plan of 1912 MMG wrote to her sister:</p>
  
<p><i>These fundamentals are so simple yet almost never put into practice - the simultaneous attack of the problems 
of distribution and occupation, the one requiring radial thoroughfares wide enough for all kinds of traffic, 
and the other requiring the complete elimination of acute angles by bringing in the distributive narrower 
streets at right angles to the thoroughfares. The third requirement is the bringing of the country into 
the city by making all residential blocks large enough in area to enclose open parks and playgrounds in 
their interior thus taking up no street frontage and so being no extravagance.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_024_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.24</b></a>)</p>

<p>WBG's architectural concepts were present, so to speak, from the beginning and now need only to be set forth.</p> 

<h4>Principles and Practices</h4>

<p>Of the general principles urged for architecture and planning by the Griffins, only the briefest mention can 
be made here.  WBG states:</p>

<p><i>Convention is not a proper basis for art. Art is not something that is put on to buildings or on to canvas 
or anywhere applied but it is the doing of some necessary thing in the best way that can be devised to do that 
thing; . . .</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_232_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.232</b></a>)</p>

<p><i>. . . [T]he stamp of the place is an essential element of each architectural problem, and any building, except the 
most vast, that is unsympathetic with its natural, human-natural, and artificial environment is neutralized and 
vitiated thereby.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_261_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.261</b></a>)</p>

<p><i>. . . [T]o attain beautiful results in architecture there must be no superficial requirements but purely rational 
ones and the whole effort of the architect must be bent toward the accomplishment of three things:- An absolute 
solution of the problem resulting from due consideration of all the elements which have any bearing on it; an 
honest use of materials in accordance with their nature, and perfection of form.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_124_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.124</b></a>)</p>

<p>And MMG lists the three functions of town planning as:</p>

<p><i>1st - To protect and preserve natural features, so that the Earth may not die. 2nd - To facilitate safe 
and secure human intercourse. 3rd - To secure close and safe contact of all to nature and to provide domicile 
with humanizing contact and interplay between human beings, and between human beings and nature.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_459_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.459</b></a>)</p>

<p>In the end, the best design is always for MMG not only the most beautiful but also the most economical and most 
practical.</p>

<p>But the primary focus of MoA is on the application of these general ideas to specific situations, WBG's "absolute 
solution of the problem."  The integration of planning and architecture impressed MMG by both its "broadening of 
view" and "positiveness of action." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_190_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.190</b></a>)  MMG writes 
that when she entered WBG's office ". . . [S]he had 
revelation after revelation, thrill after thrill. Problems which she had seen struggled over in office after office 
and never solved were being solved one after another." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_315_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.315</b></a>)  MMG notes 
in a caption to an illustration, "Griffin 
makes solving of problem the basis of design in architecture," 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_191_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.191</b></a>) and later 
adds, ". . . [O]ne is not an architect until the problem is solved." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_195_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.195</b></a>)  In fact, 
all of MoA can be seen (as MMG said of WBG's Canberra 
plan) as a statement of "the nature of the solution of the problem in both drawing and words." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_302_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.302</b></a>)</p>

<h4>Personalities</h4>

<p>It is one of the curiosities of MoA that its protagonist, WBG, emerges as a much less vivid personality than its 
author, MMG. In MoA MMG cites a number of testimonials to WBG after his death. Edgar Deans, a Castlecrag friend, 
said he "was always patient, calm, courteous." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_309_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.309</b></a>)  Noting 
WBG's charm, humor, good spirits, courtesy, 
kindness, and patience, Desmond Young, editor of the Pioneer Press in India, described him as "so entirely and 
so obviously selfless that there was something saintly about him." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_320_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.320</b></a>)  MMG 
frequently mentions his 
amiability and the sweetness of his disposition, and remarks that no one could disturb his equanimity 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_101_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.101</b></a>) 
and that perhaps he even lacked the capacity for anger 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_176_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.176</b></a>,
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_178_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>178</b></a>).  
Only rarely do any comments contradict 
this picture. Young did observe that WBG could be "obstinate"&#151;but only in defense of a properly done job&#151;and 
"intolerant"&#151;but only with shoddy work. 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_320_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.320</b></a>)  
MMG does mention once that WBG did not ". . . concern himself 
with the war [World War I] until the destruction of the cathedrals began when from his indifference to the loss 
of life (which I must confess shocked me a bit for his nature was sweetness itself in his human relations) he 
became incensed at such outrages and insisted the Germans should be wiped off the face of the earth. When I objected 
to his inconsistency . . . he brushed aside my arguments saying men could easily be replaced but how could one ever 
make up for the lost cathedrals." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_349_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.349</b></a>)  WBG is 
portrayed in MoA much like the main character in Eunice Tietjens's poem 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_016_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.16)</b></a>, 
as a being called to a higher realm.</p>

<p>In contrast, MMG, perhaps because the reader learns so much about her personal life, is an intense, even 
overwhelming voice and presence in MoA&#151;energetic, spirited, resolute, and resilient, with a "Romantic" 
sensibility and an ironic sense of humor.  MMG, as her participation in drama, dance, and music would 
suggest, must have been a theatrical, larger-than-life, personality.  There is the MMG who "drives out" 
the work of the office, who once "leaped at a draftsman and said, 'Oh, you naughty little thing. You 
have done that wrong,' " 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_307_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.307</b></a>) and 
who is called "Mother" by her apprentice draftsmen in India. 
There is the MMG who breaks her wrist practicing Russian ballet 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_153_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.153</b></a>) and 
who at age 64 climbs a 
gum tree and saws off a branch interfering with some telephone wires 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_029_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.29</b></a>). There 
is the MMG who says 
that the battle between light and dark made all the colors 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_233_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.233</b></a>) and 
tells one boy that just as his 
father needs helpers at the factory so God needs the assistance of fairies 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_261_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.261</b></a>).  
And there is also 
the MMG who says twice that a draftsman friend called her a "plain looking woman" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_289_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.289</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_296_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.296</b></a>), 
yet who also records two flattering and extravagant impressions she made on others&#151;a friend who calls her 
"Vulcana" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_146_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.146</b></a>) and an 
acquaintance who describes her as a "Witch Goddess" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_247_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.247</b></a>).  MMG adopts 
throughout MoA the persona of Xantippi (Xanthippe), not only the wife of Socrates but also an independent 
free spirit, "climbing trees that boys couldn't climb" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_029_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.29</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_096_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.96</b></a>).</p>

<p>The relationship between the two personalities of MMG and WBG must have involved some tension. At one point 
in Section III, MMG briefly alludes to leaving WBG and the Melbourne office and taking up residence alone in a 
boathouse at Castlecrag, a short period of "general testing of character" in order ultimately to develop "new 
faculties" 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_132_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.132</b></a>). In 
a more extensive passage 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_173_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.173</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_175_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>175-176</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_178_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>178-179</b></a>) MMG 
describes the time she "threw 
up [her] hands and ran away, this time to America."  Following the founder of Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, 
MMG believes that in "real love" there must be "antipathy."  She writes, "I myself . . . have said that it was 
absurd to look upon the marital relationship, if it were based on love, as having any relation to friendship, 
that it was more like that of enemies. I have told Clarmyra [MMG's niece] that one should not choose a mate 
as a friend but as an opponent, an opportunity worthy of her mettle."  MMG casts her "conflict of interests" 
with WBG as a "warfare of philosophies," of Kant vs. Nietzsche, of reason vs. some unnamed alternative (perhaps 
feeling or emotion).  She believes that only through anger&#151;"One should boil with anger. There must be anger."&#151;and 
the recognition of one's capacity for evil that the Ego can master itself to achieve "tranquility of soul" and 
"transmute [anger] into better judgments for the solution of life's riddles." The entire passage gives an added 
dimension to the Section's title, "The Individual Battle."  Yet somehow these conflicts were ultimately resolved, 
and at the time of WBG's death the Griffins had been married over twenty-five years.</p>  

<p>With regard to her relationship with WBG, MMG also says that she was "possessed . . . as if a demon took hold 
and shaped me to its whim. . . . [W]hen I encountered Walter Burley Griffin I was first swept off my feet by my 
delight in his achievements in my profession, then through a common bond of interests in nature and intellectual 
pursuits and then with the man himself. It was by no means a case of love at first sight but it was a madness when 
it struck." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_173_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.173</b></a>)  After 
WBG's death MMG relates the following exchange with the Australian engineer, James 
Alexander Smith, ". . . he said, 'No one can replace Mr. Griffin,' then after a pause, 'unless it is you,' and I 
replied, 'No I could not replace him but I was a very useful slave to him in his work.' " 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_245_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.245</b></a>)  Throughout 
MoA MMG portrays herself as completely in service to the ideas and work of WBG.  This self-effacement seems to 
extend even to the point of removing any acknowledgment of her role as the author of MoA.  On the Section I title 
pages of both N-YHS and AIC2, the words "by Mrs. Walter Burley Griffin" have been erased and replaced by "GRIFFIN 
&amp; NICHOLLS".</P>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>So what then is MoA? The work is many things: an autobiography of a personal and professional education; a 
testament to the thought and work of WBG; an apologia for the lives of two "outsiders" in Australia and India, 
and perhaps even in America&#151;part polemic, part manifesto, part exhortation.  But MoA is no mere memoir, a simple 
chronology of reminiscences complete with illustrations.  It is a kaleidoscopic omnium-gatherum of texts and images, 
which, if it could be more easily categorized, would be a much less interesting and engaging document.</p>  

<p>And what is the "magic" of America? In any number of places 
(e.g., <a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_301_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.301-302</b></a>, 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_274_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.274</b></a>) MMG 
expresses the same idea:</p>

<p><i>Now I am convinced that in this second half of the 20th century the stream of immigration to the United States 
should flow on and Americans should emigrate to all parts of the world teaching the things that have been ingrained 
in their blood through the two centuries of the experience of democracy and should spread the knowledge of it 
throughout the world for elsewhere democracy is unknown.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_296_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.296</b></a>)</p>

<p><i>There are many lovely and wonderful people elsewhere in the world but they are helpless. Migration to America frees 
their spiritual forces. That is the magic of the United States. . . . . The immediate task of Americans is to go 
out individually to every part of the world - emigrate instead of immigrate the watchword - and break down the 
bondage of individuals everywhere.</i> 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_015_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.15-16</b></a>)</p>

<p>MoA is a story about freedom and the obstacles, the "battles," it encounters&#151;a story not just about the virtues 
of democracy but of personal action as well.  Immediately after the sentence exhorting Americans to "emigrate" 
to "break down the bondage of individuals," MMG continues: "It is a difficult but not impossible task. It is 
the task of path-finders. The following is the story of one such American. He found individuals wherever he 
went who leaped to help him blaze the way in this battle against the Powers." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_1_016_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>I.16</b></a>)  According 
to MMG, " . . . each 
generation is under obligation not only to do its own work but so to teach the succeeding generation as to 
cause progress." 
(<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_406_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.406</b></a>)  In 
this sense, then, the Griffins&#151;in their lives and by their work&#151;come to embody 
the true "Magic of America."</p>

<p>But perhaps the last word on MoA should be left to MMG, something that shows her faith in "The Magic of America" 
(as well as in Anthroposophy), her essential optimism, and her humor.  On 24 January 1947 the almost 76-year-old 
MMG wrote to the 66-year-old William Gray Purcell (Purcell Papers): "Thanks for your letter. I had a good laugh 
over your magnificent pessimism. If nothing has been done about it [publishing "The Magic of America"] by 2047 
I shall follow the matter up in my next incarnation and you might lend a hand then too."</p>

<h2>Editorial Procedures for the Digital Text</h2>

<p>This section describes decisions regarding the editing of the digital text of "The Magic of America." 
The section is divided into four parts detailing the general goals of the project, the arrangement of the 
digital text, editorial changes made to the text as transcribed, and glosses and notes added to the digital 
text.</p> 

<a name="goals"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Goals of the Project</h3>

<p>The goal of "The Magic of America: Electronic Edition" is to present this long and complex archival 
document to the largest possible audience, specialist and interested reader alike. The digital text of 
the work has been designed for ease of both reading and browsing, and, as a "reading copy," to be as 
coherent and complete as possible.  As a digital text the document becomes broadly available, readily 
accessible, and searchable. The aim in transcription has been to remain as true as possible to the 
original typed text and hand printed additions of Marion Mahony Griffin.  No attempt has been made to 
record her purely editorial comments (e.g., "See if 273a & 273b are in Set. 1.") which are handwritten. 
Changes (e.g., corrections, notes) have been introduced to remove errors which would be distracting to 
the reader and to clarify obscure references.</p>

<p>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the digital text is neither a reproduction nor an authoritative 
version of the original text.  The final authority must remain with the artifactual text itself, either in 
its original form or in the facsimile formats of electronic and microform images.</p>
</ul>

<a name="organization"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Organization and Structure of the Digital Text</h3>

<p>The archival text of "The Magic of America" (MoA), as represented by two surviving typescripts (AIC1, AIC2) 
at the Art Institute of Chicago and one (N-YHS) at the New-York Historical Society, appears never to have 
been completely finished by Marion Mahony Griffin (MMG).  The typescripts&#151;though fundamentally very similar&#151;do 
differ from one another in details.  The tables of contents, for example, may be slightly different, or one 
copy may have text that is missing in one or both of the other copies. The digital text attempts to collate 
all existing texts into a single version.  This collation, however, has been done only at the page level; 
the length of the text precluded systematic comparison at the paragraph or sentence levels.  The base or copy 
text for the online version is the Art Institute's AIC2 for Section I and AIC1 for Sections II-IV. Missing or 
additional text has been transcribed from the New-York Historical Society's copy, and illustrations have 
been scanned from that copy.  Any deviation from these general sources (e.g., AIC2 text appearing in Sections 
II-IV) is noted.  (More information on the archival copies of the typescript can be found in the section 
"<a href="#archival"><strong>The Magic of America: Archival Texts</strong></a>," above.)</p>

<p>In cases where a conjectural reconstruction of the sequence of texts and illustrations was necessary, the 
sequence (though not necessarily the pagination) of entries in the relevant table of contents and the arrangement 
of the N-YHS copy were used as guides.  These instances are noted in the digital text.  Since the original text 
remains in a sense incomplete, some uniformity had to be imposed in creating the collated digital text. The 
division of the entire work into four "Sections" (or volumes) exists in all the typescripts. Within a Section 
the materials have been placed in the following order: title page(s), table of contents, frontispiece, introduction 
or preface, and "No." (i.e., "Number" or chapter).  Beyond this overall framework, however, a number of issues 
arise regarding pagination and the placement of the illustrations.</p>

<ul class="none">
<h4><em><strong>Pagination</strong></em></h4>

<p>While the pagination throughout the entire transcript is generally logical and consistent, there are points 
where the page numbering can be contradictory and confusing.  The author's renumbering (reorganizing?) of pages 
often results in several different page numbers appearing on the same sheet.  The latest page number is usually 
found at the top right page corner in Section I and at the bottom right corner in Sections II-IV.  MMG also adds 
alphabetic letters to page numbers (e.g., 1a, 2a), probably to add new or rearrange existing text.  The table of 
contents sometimes does not reflect the pagination in the typescript or follow a strict numerical sequence.  (In 
the digital version such inconsistencies are noted in the table of contents and on the text page.)</p>

<p>The digital version of the typescript follows the pagination found AIC2 for Section I and AIC1 for Sections 
II-IV, unless otherwise noted.  Page numbers in the digital text appear at the top of the page.  A page number 
without any editorial qualification refers to the pagination of the typescript.  Unnumbered front matter is named 
and if necessary given an ordinal designation (e.g., Magic of America Title Page, first page of the Table of 
Contents).  Discrepancies in pagination are resolved by adopting the arrangement that most closely follows the 
sequence listed in the table of contents and the logical content of the text pages themselves.  Although a page 
number appearing on the typescript is used whenever possible, if this number is incorrect or illogical or the 
page is unnumbered, a supplied page number is indicated in brackets.  If two unnumbered pages were inserted in 
the typescript between page 19 and page 21, the pagination would be: 19, [20], [20-2], 21.  If an unnumbered page 
were inserted between page 95 and page 96, the pagination would be: 95, [95-2], 96.  For the electronic edition 
of MoA the order of pages follows as strict a numerical and logical sequence as possible regardless of 
inconsistencies in the entries of the table of contents or in the physical arrangement of the original 
typescript.</p>

<h4><em><strong>Illustrations</strong></em></h4>

<p>In N-YHS the illustrations are for the most part stapled onto sheets of "scrap" paper and interfiled with 
the pages of the typed text: in a few cases an illustration is attached at the top or bottom of a page of text. 
The sequence (though not necessarily the pagination) of entries in the relevant table of contents and the 
location of the illustrations in the N-YHS copy have determined the placement of illustrations in the digital 
text.</p>

<p>For ease of identification the title of an illustration in the text replicates the title listed in the 
table of contents.  (Section I of MoA differs from the remaining three Sections in that MMG frequently 
indicates that an illustration should be inserted into the text at a particular point through placement 
of an explicit title, a "caption," or other reference.  In this one Section illustrations have the titles 
given them in the text rather than in the table of contents.)  Significant discrepancies between a title in 
a table of contents and the title on the illustration itself have been noted.  If the table of contents 
does not have an entry for an illustration, a "supplied title" in brackets has been given to the image. 
If there is "caption" in the text for an image, this caption usually follows the illustration to which 
it refers. All illustrations marked as "Initial" are placed at the beginning of their respective chapters. 
The "Frontispiece" is given its own separate page.</p>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="corrections"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Corrections in the Digital Text</h3>

<p>The general principle adopted has been to let the text stand as it was written and to minimize editorial 
intrusion. The text, consequently, contains many instances of what might be considered unconventional or 
non-standard spelling, punctuation and capitalization, and writing style.  Obvious errors which might 
prove distracting to the reader or might obscure meaning have been emended silently, i.e., without editorial 
notation. Again, the page images of the original archival typescript and illustrations remain the ultimate 
authority as to what has actually been written.  Changes made in the digital text transcription are summarized 
below.</p>

<ul class="none">
<p><strong>Spelling &#150;</strong> Clear errors have been silently corrected. A number of older spellings have been modernized 
(e.g., "stayed" for "staid", "no one" for "noone").  Both British and American spellings of the same word 
appear throughout the text.  Such spellings have been regularized to the American version ("civilization" for 
"civilisation," "neighbor" for "neighbour," "molding" for "moulding"), except in texts written by individuals 
other than the Griffins.  One notable exception is the retention of the spelling of "theatre" which is often 
a part of a building's name.  To simplify electronic display the use of diacritics has been avoided in the 
digital text.  Abbreviations are usually spelled out (e.g., "architect" for "archt.," "railroad" for "R.R."). 
While every effort has been made to correct mistakes, errors will no doubt continue to exist, either carried 
over inadvertently from the typescript or as the result of computer and human transcription oversights.</p>

<p><strong>Regularization &#150;</strong> The names of well-known or frequently mentioned individuals and places have been 
standardized.  This normalization, however, represents only a small number of all such references in 
the entire text.  Dates have not been standardized.  Plant names have not been verified.</p>

<p><strong>Punctuation &#150;</strong> For the most part the original punctuation has been retained (e.g., ;- and :- ). The 
use of optical character recognition in transcribing the text has meant that end-of-line hyphenation 
has survived only for unusual compounds.  The digital text reflects accurately all remaining in-line 
hyphenation.  All quotation marks ( &#147; &#148; or &#145; &#146; ) are rendered as straight quotes ( " " or ' ' ), and 
the treatment of apostrophes is similar (i.e., ' for &#146; ).</p>

<p><strong>Format &#150;</strong> The paragraph divisions of the original have been replicated, but the original line breaks 
have not. The two forms of emphasis in the typescript, underlining and all capital letters, have been 
maintained. The digitization process precluded the use of indents and centering, the lack of which will 
be noticed in title pages, tables of contents, plays, poetry, and tabular lists. The digital text 
retains, however, the general line structure of such elements.</p>

<p><strong>Additions and Deletions &#150;</strong> Textual insertions, usually hand printed, have been incorporated directly 
into the electronic text. Editorial notations (e.g., "get a photo of Wilder's barn"), usually in 
handwriting, were not transcribed.  Erasures and other deletions, when legible, have been noted in the 
text. Inadvertent repetitions of text (and page headers in the tables of contents) have not been 
reproduced.</p>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="annotations"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Annotations to the Digital Text</h3>

<p>Textual and explanatory annotations have been kept to a minimum. No systematic attempt has been made 
to elucidate all the difficulties in the form and content of the text.  Any annotation to the text will 
be displayed as "[Note: . . . .]," though in a few cases "[sic]" by itself has been introduced. Brief 
notes appear in the text, longer notes at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Notes include both comments about the organization or appearance of the text and explanations of 
various terms (e.g., personal and place names, family relationships, word definitions, allusions). 
Time and resources did not permit research into all the references made in MoA. In particular, very 
few personal names and almost no plant names have been checked and validated. Variant readings from 
the N-YHS typescript have been noted in the digital text, which is based primarily on the Art Institute 
copies. Conjectures have been noted with a "[?]", and obscure references, which could not be traced, have 
been allowed to stand. Some information about the illustrations will be found in the Notes to the digital 
text, but the <a href="../image_database.html" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Image Database</strong></a> contains 
much unique image-specific data.</p>

<h2>Editorial Procedures for the Image Database</h2>

<p>This section gives a general description of the database of illustrations for "The Magic of America" 
(MoA) by Marion Mahony Griffin (MMG) and further defines the individual fields in that database.</p>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<ul class="none">
<p><em><strong>Illustrations Found in "The Magic of America"</strong></em></p> 

<p>The Image Database consists of records both for illustrations found in the table of contents of MoA and 
for sheets containing illustrations which are not listed in the table of contents. Almost all the 
illustrations come from the New-York Historical Society copy, supplemented by a small number from The Art 
Institute of Chicago. Illustrations which are missing from the work and could not be supplied by either 
institution are noted in the database as "lacking."</p>

<p>Excluded from the database are purely informational&#151;rather than artistic&#151;diagrams (e.g., those for 
"The Technique of Sociology" 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_241_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.241</b></a>, "Threefold 
Commonwealth" 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_194_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.194</b></a>, "Drawing 
Lessons" <a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_4_251_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>IV.251</b></a> ff). 
Also excluded from the database is unillustrated printed matter (e.g., "Plays Given In The Haven Valley 
Theatre" <a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_3_462_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>III.462</b></a>, 
the abstract of the conditions and functions of the Canberra site 
<a href="../facsim_frameset/moa_2_187_facsim_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><b>II.187</b></a>). For 
items such as these the viewer should consult the page scans of the archival text.</p>

<p><em><strong>Portfolio Illustrations from The Art Institute of Chicago</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to two typescripts of MoA, the Art Institute of Chicago received a collection of approximately 
250 illustrations along with four real estate development brochures for Castlecrag and Mossmain (Montana). 
These materials appear to have been separate from the typescript and had not been integrated into the text as 
they are in the New-York Historical Society copy.  Many of the Art Institute illustrations are the same as 
or very similar to those from New York, though they generally lack the scrap paper backing found in the 
Society's copy. A small number of the Chicago images, however, are not found in the New York copy and represent 
unique items. The Chicago collection may be the original source for both duplicate and rejected images from 
which illustrations were drawn for MoA.  The Portfolio illustrations are also contained in the Image Database. The 
four real estate development brochures will be found in the 
<a href="../supplementa_frameset/supplementa_frameset.html" target="bottomFrame"><strong>Supplementa</strong></a> section.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editorial Procedures</strong></em></p>

<p>All editorial annotations are placed in brackets [ ]. Among the conventions used in transcription are:</p>

<ul class="none">
[-]  more than a single space occurs between terms on the same line, i.e., words or phrases which, though on 
the same line, are meant to be understood as separate terms (e.g., Motor Car Rotunda [-] Theatre)<br>
[/]  line break<br>
[?]  conjectural reading<br>
[illegible]  word or phrase is illegible<br>
[...]  words have not been transcribed.</p>
</ul>
	
<p>More specific information on the procedures followed in entering data into specific fields will be found in 
"Database Fields," below.</p>

<p>In identifying illustrations the following works have been particularly useful:  J. Turnbull and P. Navaretti, 
"The Griffins in Australia and India" (1998); National Library of Australia &#150; 
<a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/picturescatalogue?mode=advanced" target="_top"><b>"Pictures Catalogue &#150; 
Advanced Search"</b></a>; M. Walker, A. Kabos, and J. Weirick, "Building 
for Nature: Walter Burley Griffin and Castlecrag" (1994); and M. Maldre and P. Kruty, "Walter Burley Griffin 
in America" (1996). 
<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/" target="_top"><b>"Getty Thesaurus 
of Geographic Names Online"</b></a> was used for many geographical locations.</p>

<p>The goal of the database has been to provide information which, while being selective, is also especially 
pertinent to the illustrations themselves. Some of this information will also be found in the Digital Text, 
but the Image Database contains much unique image-specific data. Sometimes the identifying information supplied 
by MMG may be vague or mistaken. Every effort has been made to supply relevant or missing information and correct 
mistakes and inaccuracies. In spite of such efforts gaps do occur:  handwritten comments could not always be read 
completely, and not every structure or illustration subject could be identified.</p>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="fields"></a>
<ul class="none">
<h3>Database Fields</h3>

<p>The field "Architect/Designer/Creator" is a personal and corporate name list including architects (both 
individuals and firms), builders, artists, and authors. For a geographic search, the city, state/province, 
and country are separate fields and can be searched individually. The "Title/Project/Name" field includes 
architecture and planning projects, as well as persons appearing in photographs. Additional identification 
and annotations on the illustrations are placed in the "Image Notes" field. The sub-collection name indicates 
the repository holding the specific  illustration. The field "Original Image Format" notes the medium of the 
original image, not always the same as that of the physical object in MoA. "MOA Chapter reference" cites the 
location of the illustration in the text giving section, chapter and page number.</p>

<a name="searchdata"></a>
<h3>Searching the Database</h3>

<p>The database may be searched by keyword, or may be browsed by "Architect/Designer/Creator," by "Geographic 
Area," or by "Title/Project Name/Person." Results are displayed in a thumbnail image and brief description. 
Clicking on the image will produce a more detailed description of the illustration.</p>

<ul class="none">
<p><em><strong>Searching Tips</strong></em></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Conduct most searches using keywords rather than exact phrases, especially with personal names that can 
occur in both regular and inverted forms.</li>
<li>Do not use "stop words" such as "and," "or" or "the" as these may cause the search engine to return 
incorrect results.</li>
<li>Clicking on the option "search this collection" will provide an advanced search page, offering more 
complex search options including the ability to search by specific fields, use Boolean logic or search by 
proximity. </li>
<li>Architect, project names and places are standardized and may not reflect the entries exactly as found 
in Griffin's original manuscript.</li>
<li>All residences and businesses with proper names are listed last name first.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The illustrations from MoA are located within a larger database of images from the Ryerson &amp; Burnham 
Archives at the Art Institute of Chicago. This <a href="http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/mqc" target="_top"><b>
"Archival Image Collection"</b></a> database contains additional Griffin images and images of other Prairie School 
architects' projects.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries of The Art Institute of Chicago would especially like to thank staff from the 
New-York Historical Society&#151;Jean Ashton, Vice President and Library Director; Maurita Baldock, Curator of Manuscripts; 
Alan Balicki, Chief Conservator; David Burnhauser, Collections Manager; and Jill Reichenbach, Director of Rights and 
Reproductions&#151;for agreeing to the extended loan of the Society's copy of "The Magic of America" for scanning and study. 
This material has added immeasurably to the final product. As Marion Mahony Griffin once wrote, "What is valuable in 
architecture cannot be put in words. It must hit the eye. I would not mind if no one read the book through if they looked 
at the pictures. Tell me how those pictures can reach a wide audience." Hugh Wilburn, Librarian of the Frances Loeb 
Library at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, was instrumental in loaning a microform of the "The UP 
[United Provinces] Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Lucknow: Album" for scanning.</p>

<p>Members of the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries staff who have contributed significantly to the electronic edition 
include: Jack Perry Brown, Director; Mary Woolever, Architecture Archivist; Nathaniel Parks, Assistant Archivist; 
Curtis Osmun, Systems Librarian; Christine Fabian, Conservator; Cecile Webster, Conservation Assistant; Patrick 
Rogers (former Digital Imaging Technician); Joseph Tallarico, Digital Imaging Technician; Joel Cronkite, Library 
Assistant; Karen Ambrose, Volunteer; Maya Manny, Volunteer; and Ed Fishwick, Special Projects Editor.</p>

<p>Funding came from various sources. We are particularly grateful for the support of the Vernon &amp; Marcia Wagner Access 
Fund; the Julius Lewis Fund for Library Salaries; Mrs. Roderick S. Webster; the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; and an 
anonymous donor.</p>
